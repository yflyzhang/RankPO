Evidence From the Unbanked in Papua New Guinea<sep>Aceh tsunami: Long-term economic recovery after the disaster</title><abstract>Indonesia has been recognized as a country with significant potential in agriculture, not only to be self-sufficient in terms of food, but also to be the “food basket” for the world. However, given limited and competing use of resources, raising agricultural productivity is of paramount importance. To date, most of the existing work on Indonesia's agricultural sector is at the national level. Considering the extent of Indonesia's regional diversity, a provincial-level analysis of the country's agricultural sector would be more useful from a policy perspective. In this light, this paper examines agricultural productivity growth in Indonesian provinces during 2000-2011 and draws policy implications from such empirical analysis. The paper uses two methodologies, namely growth accounting and Malmquist index data envelopment analysis. Results suggest that technological change has been improving for most provinces, though there is wide variation in technical efficiency change which in turn is driving differences in total factor productivity growth across provinces.<sep>We study the impacts of a comprehensive financial inclusion program in a particularly remote, insecure and low-trust setting, lacking bridging institutions to facilitate sustained interventions. We evaluate this program in Wewak district in northwest Papua New Guinea, by randomly assigning treatment to 41 of 79 villages. The program involves a 2-day financial literacy training workshop, timely offers of no-fee bank accounts with reduced administrative hurdles, and savings ‘nudges’. We use both survey and bank account administrative data to measure its impact on financial literacy, budgeting and savings behavior, as well as on the ownership and use of bank accounts. Although 25 per cent of adults in treatment villages attended the training and 70 per cent of participants opened a bank account, we do not detect any significant downstream effects. Our results draw into question the benefit of initiatives aiming to ‘bank the unbanked’ in remote areas, revealing challenges in promoting financial inclusion among the next frontier of underserved and hard-to-reach populations.<sep>This study looks at the dynamics of the Aceh economy before and after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated Aceh, resulting in over 150,000 people killed and causing major disruption to the infrastructure, community and economy. On the other hand, the disaster served as a stepping stone to ending three decades of secessionist conflict in the province. The study analyses at the district level how different sectors of the economy have grown after the disaster in regions that were significantly affected, partly affected or not affected by the tsunami. It also looks at other macroeconomic measures such as inflation and unemployment. Analysis of time series data indicates that Aceh has managed to return to its pre-tsunami growth path, albeit at a rate slower than its closest neighbour. The poverty rate has declined and is now closer to the rest of Indonesia. The formal sector has developed and the economy has industrialised, especially in the districts worst hit by the tsunami. One concern revealed by the data, however, is that unemployment rates remain high in the worst hit districts. The study looks at the cause of this phenomenon, and what this means for Aceh's long-term recovery.</abstract>", "<keyword>Hydrogen fuel<sep>Consumption (sociology)<sep>Agriculture<sep>Per capita<sep>Hydrogen economy<sep>Hydrogen<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>Rural area<sep>Private sector<sep>Energy supply<sep>Sustainability<sep>Electricity<sep>Liquefied petroleum gas<sep>Nameplate capacity<sep>Electricity generation<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Population<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Pace<sep>Hydrogen production<sep>Sustainable development<sep>Energy consumption</keyword><title>Analysis of the Energy Scenario of Bangladesh in Current, SDG 2030 and Vision 2041<sep>Analysis the Role of Private Entities in the Energy Sector of Bangladesh<sep>Analysis of Hydrogen Show That Hydrogen Is the Best Fuel of Future in Bangladesh<sep>Analysis of Energy Sector of Bangladesh’s to Ensure the Route of Vision 2041<sep>Analysis of Household Energy Consumption and Energy Consumption Cost (Bio-Fuel) in Rural Areas of Dhaka Division, Bangladesh</title><abstract>The main concern of a country is energy in the present world. Developing country like Bangladesh is also facing challenges to meet its energy demand. For energy, Bangladesh mainly depends on Natural gas, Petroleum Oil, LPG, LNG, Coal, NGL etc. It seems that average increase of energy consumption in Bangladesh about 6% per annum. Therefore, this study analyzes current energy scenario and visualization of future energy of Bangladesh in accordance with SDG 2030 and Vision 2041. The research focuses on the following points: i) What is the current consumption of total energy in MTOE and the Per capita consumption of energy in Kgoe (Kilogram Oil Equivalent) and per capita generation of electricity in Bangladesh (kWh). ii) What is the approximate consumption of total energy in MTOE, and what will be Per capita consumption of energy in Kgoe (Kilogram Oil Equivalent) and per capita generation of electricity in Bangladesh (kWh) by 2030. iii) What is the approximate consumption of total energy in MTOE, and what will be Per capita consumption of energy in Kgoe (Kilogram Oil Equivalent) and per capita generation of electricity in Bangladesh (kWh) by 2041.<sep>In the context of globalization and open market economy, there is no alternative to the discovery of energy and mineral resources of Bangladesh and its proper management and planned use. Besides, Bangladesh is committed to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 announced by the United Nations and the government is setting the targets for the implementation of the SDGs in the light of the 8th Five-Year Plan. That is why uninterrupted fuel supply is required. The present government has identified the energy sector as a priority sector, realizing the necessity of energy sector development. The role of private companies is essential to meet the country's growing energy demands as well as to move from a mid-income country to a developed country. Therefore, this study analyzes the role of private entities in the energy sector of Bangladesh The research focuses on the following points: (i) Economic rebound through Covid-19 scenario in Bangladesh; (ii) Contribution of private entities to the energy sector of Bangladesh (iii) Challenges faced by private entities in energy sector of Bangladesh (iv) Prospects of private entities in energy sector of Bangladesh (v) private entities to enhance energy security.<sep>Bangladesh is a mid-income country. Her GDP growth rate is one of the world’s largest. For any country, development is the precondition for continued growth of GDP. And the main driving force of the country's development is energy. Proper use of hydrogen fuel is essential to meet the country's growing energy demands as well as to lift up from a mid-income country to a developed country. Hydrogen fuel will play a vital role in implementing Vision-2041. In the context of globalization and open market economy, there is no alternative to the discovery of hydrogen fuel of Bangladesh and its proper management and planned use. Hydrogen is a sustainable & renewable fuel. It is very promising to add hydrogen as fuel to the fuel mix of Bangladesh like coal and gas. Therefore, this study analyzes the Hydrogen is the best fuel of Bangladesh in accordance with Vision 2041. The research focuses on the following points: (i) Analysis of hydrogen creation, uses and storage; (ii) Analysis of hydrogen in renewable energy integration; (iii) Analysis of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle illustration; (iv) Analysis of hydrogen production and Electricity Production by Hydrogen; (v) Analysis of Green Hydrogen by Water Electrolysis and Green Hydrogen production cost.<sep>Energy is a major driving force for economic and socio-economic development of a country. Throughout the last decade Power & Energy Sector of Bangladesh has been undergone unprecedented transition towards realizing its targets set for achieving Visions (2021 & 2041). Keeping pace with the economic growth, all out efforts have been undertaken in Power & Energy Sector. As Per successful implementation of PP 2021 and MDGs, the power and energy sector targets of PP2041 and SDG7 are reasonably expected to be realized in due course. The sector is moving towards achieving long term targets to ensure energy sustainability 33,000 MW plant generation capacity, maximum peak demand 29,300 MW (in 2030), and 56,734 MW plant generation capacity, maximum peak demand 51,300 MW (in 2041). This is an appropriate time to review the achievements so far. The main objective of this research paper is to analyze the performance of the energy sector over the last decade in order to identify the areas of weaknesses and challenges and to present a set of recommendations on long term sustainability. From methodological point of view, the current practice is to analyze a gap in the sector aimed at identifying weaknesses. Therefore, this study focuses on the following issues in the energy sector of Bangladesh’s to ensure the route of vision 2041: (i) Perspective Plan 2041 for Energy Sector in Bangladesh; (ii) Present status of Electricity Generation in energy sector of Bangladesh (iii) Energy Pricing and Policy in Bangladesh (iv) Major Initiatives in Energy Sectors of Bangladesh (v) Challenges faced by vision 2041 in energy sector of Bangladesh. Energy plays an important role in the development and security of any country, poverty eradication, economic growth and sustainable infrastructure. Therefore, future economic growth will depend significantly on the availability of electricity.<sep>With the progress of rapid population growth, the energy demand in Bangladesh has been increasing rapidly over the years, so the main objective of the study is to know the monthly and yearly energy consumption and energy consumption price (Bio-fuel) in the rural areas of Dhaka Division. To achieve the objectives and scope of work of this study, both qualitative and quantitative methods have been used. In carrying out this study, data regarding the environment, challenges, and potential recommendations have been collected from several primary and secondary sources. To collect the primary data, a survey and key informant interviews (KIIs) using semi-structured questionnaires have been carried out on household fuel stakeholders to the rural areas in Bangladesh. To furnish the objectives, primary data on the five key peer district – Dhaka, Narayangonj, Gazipur, Munshiganj and Narsingdi-have been sourced from field data. Based on the secondary data and literature review of some several policy/regulatory and market-related challenges and barriers to bio-fuel are identified in this research. The main findings of the study are as follows-(i) Most rural households still depend on biofuels for cooking and heating. Bio-fuels are: degraded vegetation and forest reserves and agricultural residues. (ii) The smart and clean energy like LPG and electricity though present have limited use by the rural households due to high price and supply and availability of accessories. (iii) Household fuel in rural areas is a critical problem for the rural poor is that teenage boys and girls are engaged in harvesting bio-fuels from nature, hampering their education. (iv) The use of obnoxious materials as fuel is causing health and environmental damage which is causing respiratory diseases among the older and children of the family due to reasons unknown to the users. (v) Due to weak financial capacity of the households, they are deprived of access to modern smart and clean energy. (vi) In most cases housewife’s have to bear all the burden of managing fuel for cooking neglecting the health and safety of children. The results of the study show that 82% of households use bio-fuels as their main source of energy, which accounts for an annual energy consumption of 4.68 MTOE in Dhaka Division and a value of $1.435 billion. Also alternative source of energy such as castor, karanja, pithraj, mahua, jatropha, neem seed, rubber seed etc. have huge potential to be sustainable source of energy to be explored.</abstract>", "<keyword>Sunk costs<sep>Mangrove<sep>Gross domestic product<sep>Flexibility (engineering)<sep>Deforestation (computer science)<sep>Per capita<sep>Net present value<sep>Investment (military)<sep>Forest degradation<sep>Gross private domestic investment<sep>Gross fixed capital formation<sep>Biomass (ecology)<sep>Value (mathematics)<sep>Forest inventory</keyword><title>Using Real Options to Estimate the Pre-commercialisation Value of a Drought Tolerant Wheat Trait<sep>Mangrove biomass and carbon estimates for REDD+ from national forest inventory in two regions of Myanmar<sep>Quantifying the economy‐wide returns to innovation for Australia</title><abstract>Uncertainty, sunk investment costs and managerial flexibility means standard investment budgeting methods such as net present value are ineffective and undervalue risky investments. Real options attains a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of investments. In this study, we apply a real options analytical framework to investment decisions during the research and development (R&amp;D) process of a drought tolerant wheat trait. The results suggest the option value for investment is positive at each R&amp;D stage and that investors should continue to invest. Biotechnology firms should use a real options analytical framework like the one applied in this paper for investment strategy development and for investment decisions involving uncertainty, sunk costs and decision flexibility.<sep>Myanmar has the second largest area of mangrove forests in South East Asia while suffering high deforestation rates and forest degradation. However, monitoring results from existing studies in mangrove forests vary widely while specific estimates on carbon density for this forest type are deficient. Also, data from mangrove inventory plots used for the 2018 Myanmar forest reference level refer only to commercial timber and do not include other carbon pools. The results in this study based on four carbon pools allow for updating the emission factors in mangrove forests expressed in CO 2 from 125.43 ± 15.06 Mg ha –1 to 1 377.07 ± 67.04 Mg ha –1 for Ayeyarwady region (Pyapon, Pathein, Latputta districts) and 1 583.27± 75.18 Mg ha –1 for Tanintharyi region (Kawthaung, Dawei districts) and can be used in (sub)national or jurisdictional forest reference level for REDD+. In addition, the georeferenced biomass estimates are useful for the calibration of space-based models of biomass estimation.<sep>Abstract Innovation plays a vital role in driving Australia's economic growth, and the desire to quantify this relationship is ever present. This article quantifies the relationship between domestic gross expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D) and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth to estimate the return on investment (ROI) to innovation for Australia. This article adopts the Jones and Summers (2020) approach to quantify the ROI of gross R&amp;D spending for Australia. This novel yet simple macroeconomic approach complements other existing methodologies. It quantifies only economic benefits, excluding non‐monetary societal and environmental benefits. The baseline results state that $1 of R&amp;D investment creates an average of $20.8 in economy‐wide benefits in today's dollars, and investment in R&amp;D creates an average annual return of 104% for Australia. Importantly, this baseline result can be recalculated with adjustments to account for specific features of innovation activity. Incorporating a 10‐year delay between R&amp;D and payoffs, combined with a correction for building R&amp;D into new capital inputs (known as embodied capital deepening) to account for the additional time and costs associated with R&amp;D expenditure yields lower results of $3.5 of economy‐wide benefits and 10% average annual return for every dollar spent on R&amp;D. Even when corrections are applied to the baseline for conservative estimates, the economy‐wide returns to innovation are comparable to historical private investment returns in Australia.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Cas9<sep>Conditional gene knockout<sep>Genome<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Calmodulin<sep>Calcium<sep>Gene knockout<sep>Premovement neuronal activity<sep>Synaptic plasticity<sep>Glutamate receptor<sep>Neocortex<sep>Receptor<sep>Dendritic spine<sep>CRISPR<sep>CREB</keyword><title>Rapid generation of conditional knockout mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and electroporation for neuroscience research<sep>In Vivo Imaging of the Coupling between Neuronal and CREB Activity in the Mouse Brain<sep>Mechanisms of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II activation in single dendritic spines</title><abstract>Abstract The Cre/LoxP-based conditional knockout technology is a powerful tool for gene function analysis that allows region- and time-specific gene manipulation. However, inserting a pair of LoxP cassettes to generate conditional knockout can be technically challenging and thus time- and resource-consuming. This study proposes an efficient, low-cost method to generate floxed mice using in vitro fertilization and the CRISPR-Cas9 system over two consecutive generations. This method allowed us to produce floxed mice targeting exons 5 and 6 of CaMK1 in a short period of 125 days, using only 16 mice. In addition, we directly edited the genome of fertilized eggs of mice with our target genetic background, C57BL/6 N, to eliminate additional backcrossing steps. We confirmed that the genome of the generated floxed mice was responsive to the Cre protein. This low-cost, time-saving method for generating conditional knockout will facilitate comprehensive, tissue-specific genome analyses.<sep>Sensory experiences cause long-term modifications of neuronal circuits by modulating activity-dependent transcription programs that are vital for regulation of long-term synaptic plasticity and memory. However, it has not been possible to precisely determine the interaction between neuronal activity patterns and transcription factor activity. Here we present a technique using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2pFLIM) with new FRET biosensors to chronically image in vivo signaling of CREB, an activity-dependent transcription factor important for synaptic plasticity, at single-cell resolution. Simultaneous imaging of the red-shifted CREB sensor and GCaMP permitted exploration of how experience shapes the interplay between CREB and neuronal activity in the neocortex of awake mice. Dark rearing increased the sensitivity of CREB activity to Ca2+ elevations and prolonged the duration of CREB activation to more than 24 h in the visual cortex. This technique will allow researchers to unravel the transcriptional dynamics underlying experience-dependent plasticity in the brain.<sep>Abstract CaMKIIα plays an essential role in decoding Ca 2+ signaling in spines by acting as a leaky Ca 2+ integrator with the time constant of several seconds. However, the mechanism by which CaMKIIα integrates Ca 2+ signals remains elusive. Here, we imaged CaMKIIα-CaM association in single dendritic spines using a new FRET sensor and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. In response to a glutamate uncaging pulse, CaMKIIα-CaM association increases in ~0.1 s and decays over ~3 s. During repetitive glutamate uncaging, which induces spine structural plasticity, CaMKIIα-CaM association did not show further increase but sustained at a constant level. Since CaMKIIα activity integrates Ca 2+ signals over ~10 s under this condition, the integration of Ca 2+ signal by CaMKIIα during spine structural plasticity is largely due to Ca 2+ /CaM-independent, autonomous activity. Based on these results, we propose a simple kinetic model of CaMKIIα activation in dendritic spines.</abstract>", "<keyword>Reynolds stress equation model<sep>Code (set theory)<sep>Convection<sep>Reynolds stress<sep>Hyperparameter<sep>Partial differential equation<sep>Direct numerical simulation<sep>Turbulence modeling<sep>Nusselt number<sep>Physical system<sep>Generative grammar<sep>Rayleigh number<sep>Dynamical systems theory<sep>Symplectic geometry<sep>Artificial neural network<sep>Aspect ratio (aeronautics)<sep>Reynolds number<sep>Variational integrator<sep>Ode<sep>Homogeneous space<sep>Robustness (evolution)<sep>Convolutional neural network<sep>Phase space<sep>Autoencoder<sep>Manifold (fluid mechanics)<sep>Tensor (intrinsic definition)<sep>Dissipative system<sep>Large eddy simulation<sep>Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations<sep>Anisotropy<sep>Hamiltonian system<sep>Interpretability<sep>Space (punctuation)<sep>Regularization (linguistics)<sep>Ordinary differential equation<sep>Scaling<sep>Rayleigh–Bénard convection<sep>Differential equation<sep>Parallelizable manifold<sep>Hamiltonian (control theory)<sep>Lagrangian coherent structures<sep>Korteweg–de Vries equation<sep>Turbulence<sep>Nonlinear system<sep>Laminar flow</keyword><title>Coherent solutions and transition to turbulence in two-dimensional Rayleigh-Bénard convection<sep>Multi-Task Learning based Convolutional Models with Curriculum Learning for the Anisotropic Reynolds Stress Tensor in Turbulent Duct Flow.<sep>Multi-Task Learning based Convolutional Models with Curriculum Learning\n  for the Anisotropic Reynolds Stress Tensor in Turbulent Duct Flow<sep>Learning a reduced basis of dynamical systems using an autoencoder<sep>Solving Differential Equations Using Neural Network Solution Bundles.<sep>High Rayleigh number variational multiscale large eddy simulations of Rayleigh-Bénard convection<sep>DEQGAN: Learning the Loss Function for PINNs with Generative Adversarial\n  Networks<sep>Convolutional neural network models and interpretability for the anisotropic reynolds stress tensor in turbulent one-dimensional flows<sep>Convolutional Neural Network Models and Interpretability for the\n  Anisotropic Reynolds Stress Tensor in Turbulent One-dimensional Flows<sep>Unsupervised Learning of Solutions to Differential Equations with Generative Adversarial Networks.<sep>High Rayleigh number variational multiscale large eddy simulations of\n  Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard Convection<sep>High Rayleigh number variational multiscale large eddy simulations of Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard Convection<sep>Hamiltonian neural networks for solving equations of motion<sep>Port-Hamiltonian neural networks for learning explicit time-dependent dynamical systems<sep>Neural network models for the anisotropic Reynolds stress tensor in turbulent channel flow<sep>Physical Symmetries Embedded in Neural Networks<sep>Hamiltonian Neural Networks for solving differential equations<sep>Extending a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Network for\n  Superresolution Studies of Rayleigh-B\\'enard Convection</title><abstract>Optimal, exact coherent solutions have been shown to tightly bound the scaling of heat transport in two-dimensional turbulent Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection.

In this work, we use an autoencoder with latent space penalization to discover approximate finite-dimensional manifolds of two canonical partial differential equations. We test this method on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (K-S), Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), and damped KdV equations. We show that the resulting optimal latent space of the K-S equation is consistent with the dimension of the inertial manifold. We then uncover a nonlinear basis representing the manifold of the latent space for the K-S equation. The results for the KdV equation show that it is more difficult to recover a reduced latent space, which is consistent with the truly infinite-dimensional dynamics of the KdV equation. In the case of the damped KdV equation, we find that the number of active dimensions decreases with increasing damping coefficient.<sep>The time evolution of dynamical systems is frequently described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which must be solved for given initial conditions. Most standard approaches numerically integrate ODEs producing a single solution whose values are computed at discrete times. When many varied solutions with different initial conditions to the ODE are required, the computational cost can become significant. We propose that a neural network be used as a solution bundle, a collection of solutions to an ODE for various initial states and system parameters. The neural network solution bundle is trained with an unsupervised loss that does not require any prior knowledge of the sought solutions, and the resulting object is differentiable in initial conditions and system parameters. The solution bundle exhibits fast, parallelizable evaluation of the system state, facilitating the use of Bayesian inference for parameter estimation in real dynamical systems.<sep>The variational multiscale (VMS) formulation is used to develop residual-based VMS large eddy simulation (LES) models for Rayleigh-Bénard convection. The resulting model is a mixed model that incorporates the VMS model and an eddy viscosity model. The Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-viscosity (WALE) model is used as the eddy viscosity model in this work. The new LES models were implemented in the finite element code Drekar. Simulations are performed using continuous, piecewise linear finite elements. The simulations ranged from Ra=106 to Ra=1014 and were conducted at Pr=1 and Pr=7. Two domains were considered: a two-dimensional domain of aspect ratio 2 with a fluid confined between two parallel plates and a three-dimensional cylinder of aspect ratio 1/4. The Nusselt number from the VMS results is compared against three dimensional direct numerical simulations and experiments. In all cases, the VMS results are in good agreement with existing literature.<sep>Solutions to differential equations are of significant scientific and engineering relevance. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising method for solving differential equations, but they lack a theoretical justification for the use of any particular loss function. This work presents Differential Equation GAN (DEQGAN), a novel method for solving differential equations using generative adversarial networks to \"learn the loss function\" for optimizing the neural network. Presenting results on a suite of twelve ordinary and partial differential equations, including the nonlinear Burgers', Allen-Cahn, Hamilton, and modified Einstein's gravity equations, we show that DEQGAN can obtain multiple orders of magnitude lower mean squared errors than PINNs that use $L_2$, $L_1$, and Huber loss functions. We also show that DEQGAN achieves solution accuracies that are competitive with popular numerical methods. Finally, we present two methods to improve the robustness of DEQGAN to different hyperparameter settings.<sep>The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in turbulence applications.

The majority of previous work has focused on the development of fully-connected networks for modeling the anisotropic Reynolds stress tensor. In this paper, we expand upon recent work for turbulent channel flow and develop new convolutional neural network (CNN) models that are able to accurately predict the normalized anisotropic Reynolds stress tensor. We apply the new CNN model to a number of one-dimensional turbulent flows. Additionally, we present interpretability techniques that help drive the model design and provide guidance on the model behavior in relation to the underlying physics.<sep>The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in turbulence applications.

We present a Hamiltonian neural network that solves the differential equations that govern dynamical systems. This is an equation-driven machine learning method where the optimization process of the network depends solely on the predicted functions without using any ground truth data. The model learns solutions that satisfy, up to an arbitrarily small error, Hamilton's equations and, therefore, conserve the Hamiltonian invariants. The choice of an appropriate activation function drastically improves the predictability of the network. Moreover, an error analysis is derived and states that the numerical errors depend on the overall network performance. The Hamiltonian network is then employed to solve the equations for the nonlinear oscillator and the chaotic Hénon-Heiles dynamical system. In both systems, a symplectic Euler integrator requires two orders more evaluation points than the Hamiltonian network to achieve the same order of the numerical error in the predicted phase space trajectories.<sep>Accurately learning the temporal behavior of dynamical systems requires models with well-chosen learning biases. Recent innovations embed the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms into neural networks and demonstrate a significant improvement over other approaches in predicting trajectories of physical systems. These methods generally tackle autonomous systems that depend implicitly on time or systems for which a control signal is known a priori. Despite this success, many real world dynamical systems are nonautonomous, driven by time-dependent forces and experience energy dissipation. In this study, we address the challenge of learning from such nonautonomous systems by embedding the port-Hamiltonian formalism into neural networks, a versatile framework that can capture energy dissipation and time-dependent control forces. We show that the proposed port-Hamiltonian neural network can efficiently learn the dynamics of nonlinear physical systems of practical interest and accurately recover the underlying stationary Hamiltonian, time-dependent force, and dissipative coefficient. A promising outcome of our network is its ability to learn and predict chaotic systems such as the Duffing equation, for which the trajectories are typically hard to learn.<sep>Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are presently one of the most popular models for simulating turbulence. Performing RANS simulation requires additional modelling for the anisotropic Reynolds stress tensor, but traditional Reynolds stress closure models lead to only partially reliable predictions. Recently, data-driven turbulence models for the Reynolds anisotropy tensor involving novel machine learning techniques have garnered considerable attention and have been rapidly developed. Focusing on modelling the Reynolds stress closure for the specific case of turbulent channel flow, this paper proposes three modifications to a standard neural network to account for the no-slip boundary condition of the anisotropy tensor, the Reynolds number dependence, and spatial non-locality. The modified models are shown to provide increased predicative accuracy compared to the standard neural network when they are trained and tested on channel flow at different Reynolds numbers. The best performance is yielded by the model combining the boundary condition enforcement and Reynolds number injection. This model also outperforms the Tensor Basis Neural Network in Ling et al. [Reynolds averaged turbulence modelling using deep neural networks with embedded invariance. J Fluid Mech. 2016;807:155–166] on the turbulent channel flow dataset.<sep>Neural networks are a central technique in machine learning. Recent years have seen a wave of interest in applying neural networks to physical systems for which the governing dynamics are known and expressed through differential equations. Two fundamental challenges facing the development of neural networks in physics applications is their lack of interpretability and their physics-agnostic design. The focus of the present work is to embed physical constraints into the structure of the neural network to address the second fundamental challenge. By constraining tunable parameters (such as weights and biases) and adding special layers to the network, the desired constraints are guaranteed to be satisfied without the need for explicit regularization terms. This is demonstrated on upervised and unsupervised networks for two basic symmetries: even/odd symmetry of a function and energy conservation. In the supervised case, the network with embedded constraints is shown to perform well on regression problems while simultaneously obeying the desired constraints whereas a traditional network fits the data but violates the underlying constraints. Finally, a new unsupervised neural network is proposed that guarantees energy conservation through an embedded symplectic structure. The symplectic neural network is used to solve a system of energy-conserving differential equations and out-performs an unsupervised, non-symplectic neural network.<sep>There has been a wave of interest in applying machine learning to study dynamical systems. In particular, neural networks have been applied to solve the equations of motion, and therefore, track the evolution of a system. In contrast to other applications of neural networks and machine learning, dynamical systems -- depending on their underlying symmetries -- possess invariants such as energy, momentum, and angular momentum. Traditional numerical iteration methods usually violate these conservation laws, propagating errors in time, and reducing the predictability of the method. We present a Hamiltonian neural network that solves the differential equations that govern dynamical systems. This unsupervised model is learning solutions that satisfy identically, up to an arbitrarily small error, Hamilton's equations and, therefore, conserve the Hamiltonian invariants. Once it is optimized, the proposed architecture is considered a symplectic unit due to the introduction of an efficient parametric form of solutions. In addition, by sharing the network parameters and the choice of an appropriate activation function drastically improve the predictability of the network. An error analysis is derived and states that the numerical errors depend on the overall network performance. The symplectic architecture is then employed to solve the equations for the nonlinear oscillator and the chaotic Henon-Heiles dynamical system. In both systems, the symplectic Euler integrator requires two orders more evaluation points than the Hamiltonian network in order to achieve the same order of the numerical error in the predicted phase space trajectories.<sep>A prominent bottleneck for advancing our understanding of astrophysical turbulence is the limited resolution of numerical simulations, which inhibits fully sampling scales in the inertial range. Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated promise in up-scaling resolution in both image analysis and numerical simulations (i.e., superresolution). Here we employ and further develop a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (CNN) ML model called \"MeshFreeFlowNet'' for superresolution studies of turbulent systems. The MeshFreeFlowNet CNN is trained both on the simulation images as well as the evaluated PDEs, making it sensitive to the underlying physics of a particular fluid system. In particular, we aim to generate a superresolution framework for 2D turbulent Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection (RBC) generated with the Dedalus code. We modify the MeshFreeFlowNet architecture to include the full set of simulation PDEs and the boundary conditions. Our training set includes fully developed turbulence sampling Rayleigh numbers (Ra) of Ra=10^6-10^{10}. We evaluate the success of the learned simulations by comparing the direct Dedalus simulation power spectra to the predicted CNN output power spectra. We compare both ground truth and predicted power spectral inertial range scalings to theoretical predictions. We find that the network performs well at all Ra studied here in recovering large-scale information, including the inertial range slopes. We find that our updated architecture performs well on laminar and turbulent flows, but the results towards smaller-scales are significantly better as the flow transitions to more turbulent regimes. This is likely because more turbulent systems have a rich variety of structures at many length scales compared to laminar flows. We also find that the superresolution prediction is overly dissipative at smaller scales than that of the inertial range.</abstract>", "<keyword>Interpretation (philosophy)<sep>Stall (fluid mechanics)<sep>Sensory system<sep>Repertoire<sep>Olfactory perception<sep>Disease<sep>Dissolution<sep>Resting state fMRI<sep>Affect (linguistics)<sep>Tactile stimuli<sep>Domestication<sep>Brain activity and meditation<sep>Weaning<sep>Sensory stimulation therapy<sep>Identification (biology)<sep>Extrusion<sep>Kinetics<sep>Perception<sep>Quantitative electroencephalography<sep>Animal welfare<sep>Offspring<sep>Foal<sep>Electroencephalography<sep>Captivity<sep>Lateralization of brain function<sep>Adverse effect<sep>Butyrylcholinesterase<sep>Purebred<sep>Chronic pain<sep>Atopic dermatitis<sep>Gestation<sep>Population<sep>Fish <Actinopterygii><sep>Zolpidem<sep>Stressor<sep>Variety (cybernetics)<sep>Stimulus (psychology)<sep>Acetylcholinesterase<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Term (time)<sep>Aquaculture<sep>Cart<sep>Back pain<sep>Animal cognition<sep>Vocal communication<sep>Work (physics)<sep>Representation (politics)<sep>Cognition<sep>Test (biology)<sep>Welfare<sep>Habituation<sep>Equus<sep>Animal-assisted therapy<sep>Resource (disambiguation)<sep>Odor<sep>Sciaenidae<sep>Breed<sep>Aché<sep>Saliva<sep>Disproportionation</keyword><title>The vocal repertoire of preterm infants: Characteristics and possible applications<sep>A novel, short and easy-to-perform method to evaluate newborns’ social olfactory preferences<sep>Mutual interactions between cognition and welfare: The horse as an animal model<sep>Selected Acoustic Frequencies Have a Positive Impact on Behavioural and Physiological Welfare Indicators in Thoroughbred Racehorses<sep>Detecting Welfare in a Non-Verbal Species: Social/Cultural Biases and Difficulties in Horse Welfare Assessment<sep>Calling activity and calls' temporal features inform about fish reproductive condition and spawning in three cultured Sciaenidae species<sep>Domestic Foal Weaning: Need for Re-Thinking Breeding Practices?<sep>What Do We Know about Pruritus in Very Young Infants?

Most reports focus on crying when in pain or hungry. We evaluated young preterm infants’ spontaneous vocal production in non-painful contexts. We identified a vocal repertoire composed of nine types of vocalisations. High-pitched sounds were associated with relaxed postures, implying a positive valence, whereas long low-pitched vocalisations, associated more with grimaces and muscle tensions, appeared to have a more negative valence. Infants’ vocalisations were useful indicators of their internal state in two situations (when exposed to clothing constraints and environmental noises).<sep>Humans’ early olfactory perception has been studied mainly within the framework of mother–offspring interactions and only a few studies have focused on newborns’ abilities to discriminate body odors per se. The aim of this study was to develop a method to evaluate olfactory social preferences of infants at term-equivalent age. Twenty dyads of infants (10 born preterm and 10 born at term) at term-equivalent age and their mothers were included. We analyzed the behavioral reactions of infants to their mother's upper-chest odor (that bears social, non-food related information). The two impregnated gauzes and a control gauze were presented to the infants for 10 s each, in a random order. We compared two durations of gauze impregnation: 30 min and 12 h. This study reveals that mothers’ upper chest emits sufficient olfactory information to induce reactions in infants born full-term or born preterm and that a short impregnation is preferable to evaluate their perception of body odors, notably for those born preterm.<sep>Research in cognitive psychology has repeatedly shown how much cognition and emotions are mutually related to one another. Psychological disorders are associated with cognitive (attention, memory and judgment) biases and chronic pain may affect attention, learning or memory. Laboratory studies have provided useful insights about the processes involved but observations about spontaneous animal models, living in different stress/welfare conditions may help understand further how cognition and welfare are interrelated in the « real world ». Domestic horses constitute such a model as they live in a variety of conditions that impact differently their welfare state. In the present review, we try and provide an overview of the scientific literature on cognition and welfare of domestic horses and their interrelationship. We address how emotions and welfare may affect cognitive processes in horses and impact the way they perceive their environment (including work). We propose new methods for assessing the relationship between welfare and cognition and open up the discussion on the evolution of the brain and the part domestication may have played.<sep>(1) Background: Since antiquity, it is considered that sounds influence human emotional states and health. Acoustic enrichment has also been proposed for domestic animals. However, in both humans and animals, effects vary according to the type of sound. Human studies suggest that frequencies, more than melodies, play a key role. Low and high frequencies, music tuning frequency and even EEG slow waves used for ‘neurofeedback’ produce effects. (2) Methods: We tested the possible impact of such pure frequencies on racehorses’ behavior and physiology. A commercial non-audible acoustic stimulus, composed of an array of the above-mentioned frequencies, was broadcasted twice daily and for three weeks to 12 thoroughbred horses in their home stall. (3) Results: The results show a decrease in stereotypic behaviors and other indicators such as yawning or vacuum chewing, an increase in the time spent in recumbent resting and foraging, and better hematological measures during and after the playback phase for 4 of the 10 physiological parameters measured. (4) Conclusions: These results open new lines of research on possible ways of alleviating the stress related to housing and training conditions in racehorses and of improving physical recovery.<sep>Horses were domesticated for more than 5000 years and have been one of the most emblematic species living alongside humans. This long-shared history would suggest that horses are well known and well understood, but scientific data raise many concerns about the welfare state of most domestic horses suggesting that many aspects have been largely misunderstood. In the present review, we will examine some of the possible human factors that may explain the huge prevalence of welfare problems, despite horses being of special importance to humans. First of all, as horses are non-verbal, current management practices rely upon what one thinks is good for them, which opens the way to subjective interpretations and projections, based on one’s own subjective experience but probably still more on cultural/social norms and influences, traditions and beliefs. The lack of recognition, identification, or even the misinterpretation of signals are other potential reasons for welfare issues. Lastly, the over-exposure to animals with expressions of compromised welfare may lead to lower sensitivity of owners/professionals. That is why we lastly suggest that instead of simply providing information on what to do, we should promote validated visible indicators that leave less room for personal interpretation.<sep>Although many fish species are vocal, the use of fish sounds for aquaculture management and wild population protection has not received much attention. In this study, sound production of three members of the Sciaenidae family was monitored before and during spawning in aquaculture facilities. The species examined include the meagre Argyrosomus regius, the shi dum Umbrina cirrosa and red drum Sciaenops ocellatus. Red drum reproduces spontaneously in captivity, whereas shi drum and meagre often require hormonal stimulation using gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) for the induction of oocyte maturation, ovulation and spawning. In all three species, a clear increase in calling activity was detected during spawning nights, when longer sounds with a higher number of faster repeated pulses were emitted. Changes of call temporal features could be related to histological changes in the sonic muscles. After GnRHa treatment and during spawning, meagre sonic fibres were wider and the ratio of sarcoplasmic reticulum to myofibril cross-sectional area was higher. The correlation of calling activity with spawning events opens up the possibility of using the monitoring of calling activity and of call temporal features as tools for evaluating the reproductive state of different sciaenid species, both in the wild and captivity.<sep>Artificial weaning is a standard practice known to be one of the most stressful events in a domestic foal’s life. Research has mainly focused on ways to alleviate weaning stress. However, there is still a need for more detailed research on what should constitute best practices with respect to animal welfare. The aim of this review is to address this issue by examining the natural weaning process. We first provide an overview of the scientific literature on the natural temporal dynamics of the dam-offspring bond in horses: it is to be noted that the natural process of weaning is little documented, individual variations have been poorly investigated and immediate effects of weaning on the mare–foal relationship remain unexplored. To partly address these gaps, we performed a study around the weaning period on 16 mare–foal pairs kept with minimal human interference. Most foals were weaned spontaneously when 9-10 months old, with individual variations mainly due to the conception rate of mares. Natural weaning induced no stress response in either partner and was performed without clear signs of rejection by the dams either just before or after. We lastly open up the discussion on the need for rethinking weaning practices under domestic conditions.<sep>In infants, pruritus is frequently considered as absent because they do not scratch themselves. Because pruritus could induce severe adverse effects in this vulnerable population, we aimed to review existing evidence on the ability of young infants to experience itch and on how to assess itch-related discomfort in this population. A literature review was performed (Pubmed, Google Scholar). Neurological itch pathways are well described. Skin development starts early during gestation. At 34 weeks of gestation, skin is almost complete while skin adaptations occur after birth. Newborn skin is neurologically functional, including the ability for young infants to feel pain. Similarities and interactions between pain and pruritus support the hypothesis that infants could feel pruritus. However, the existence of pruritus in infants has never been evidenced. Many itchy conditions can affect them, suggesting non-negligible prevalence of infant pruritus among which atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most studied disease. Studies reported a negative impact of AD on children and their families. There is no existing validated method to assess pruritus in infants, although they may feel pruritus and chronic pruritus can lead to serious adverse effects. To appropriately diagnose pruritus appears of great interest among young infants. Development of a method is required to this aim.<sep>The current study aimed at optimizing a previously developed non-clinical formulation for use in zolpidem deprescribing. The formulation under investigation consists of extruded zolpidem hemitartrate (30% w/w) and Eudragit EPO (70% w/w) mixtures which display unsatisfactory dissolution behavior. Both milled extrudates and physical mixtures were compressed to produce tablets with identical target weight and solid fraction. First, the susceptibility of zolpidem hemitartrate towards heat and shear degradation was identified utilizing thermal and HPLC-DAD analysis. The drug salt proved prone to thermally induced disproportionation. Moreover, the impurity content increased after applying hot melt extrusion although ICH guidelines were still attained. Secondly, extrudates and physical mixtures were subjected to FTIR analysis. As a result, interaction and protonation of the dimethyl aminoethyl group from Eudragit EPO resulting from zolpidem disproportionation was elucidated. As such, the formulations' slow dissolution kinetics in comparison to formulations containing non-ionizable polymers (e.g. Kollidon 12PF and Kollidon VA64) is explained. Finally, addition of tartaric acid, a microenvironmental pH modulator and common ion, proved a successful method to increase dissolution kinetics. The amount of drug released after 15 min increased drastically from 10 to 40% upon the addition of 5% tartaric acid. Immediate release behavior (80% within 15 min) was however not yet attained.<sep>Acute stress induces an array of behavioural reactions in horses that vary between individuals. Attempts to relate behavioural patterns and physiological responses have not always given clear-cut results. Here, we measured the changes in a panel of salivary components: salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), lipase, total esterase (TEA), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), adenosine deaminase (ADA), and cortisol, and their potential link with horses’ behaviours after acute stress. Saliva samples were collected in nine riding horses subjected to a test consisting of opening an umbrella. Saliva sampling was obtained at a basal time point in the stall (T1), in the test indoor arena (T2), at a time of stress (T3), and 30 min (T4) and 60 min (T5) later. The horses’ behaviour was recorded at T3 for 1 minute. sAA, lipase, TEA, and BChE showed significant changes along time, increasing at T3 for BChE, and decreasing at T4 for sAA and BChE. Butyrylcholinesterase appeared to be the most reliable predictor of behavioural responses, as it correlated with the index of emotionality, of laterality, and the occurrence of alarm signals, while sAA decreased when horses expressed quieter behaviours. These first results bring promising lines for novel, more precise physiological markers of acute stress in horses that can bridge the gap between behaviour and physiology.<sep>Although the question of animal welfare has been an important source of concern in the scientific community for several decades, many aspects are still under debate. On-farm assessments have to be rapid, acceptable to farmers and safe for both the assessors and animals. They are thus very demanding, with multiple decisions to make, such as the choice of appropriate indicators, sampling methods and scoring. Research has moved from resource-based to animal-based criteria, which reflects the subjective welfare state of an animal rather than relying upon external indices. In the present review, we describe two major (i.e., the most frequently/recently tested or disseminated) protocols: one in low-/middle-income countries, and the other in high-income countries, for on-farm assessments of horses, using animal-based resources; we evaluate their strengths and limitations, and then we compare their results with those obtained by various other studies. We propose lines of improvement, particularly in view of public dissemination, and offer suggestions for further refinement or new protocols. We emphasize the high risks of putting the cart before the horse, i.e., proposing protocols that rely upon indicators and sampling methods that need to be refined, as this could lead to under-evaluation (or less likely over-evaluation) of current welfare problems. Because welfare is a subjective experience, the true representation of an individual's actual welfare<sep>Assessing chronic pain is a challenge given its subjective dimension. In humans, resting state electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising tool although the results of various studies are contradictory. Spontaneous chronic pain is understudied in animals but could be of the highest interest for a comparative study. Riding horses show a very high prevalence of back disorders thought to be associated with chronic pain. Moreover, horses with known back problems show cognitive alterations, such as a lower attentional engagement. Therefore, we hypothesized that the individual EEG power profiles resting state (i.e. quiet standing) of different horses could reflect the state of their back, that we measured using static sEMG, a tool first promoted to assess lower back pain in human patients. Results show that 1) EEG profiles are highly stable at the intra-individual level, 2) horses with elevated back tension showed resting state EEG profiles characterized by more fast (beta and gamma) and less slow (theta and alpha) waves. The proportion of theta waves was particularly negatively correlated with muscular tension along the spine. Moreover, elevated back tension was positively correlated with the frequency of stereotypic behaviours (an \"addictive- like\" repetitive behavior) performed by the horses in their stall. Resting state quantitative EEG appears therefore as a very promising tool that may allow to assess individual<sep>Several previous studies have shown that working conditions (including riding) can induce stress in horses. Riders' actions and postures, when inappropriate, induce stress and conflict behaviours during riding and welfare impairment and negative emotional states outside work. Optimistic biases have been found in leisure horses, which, amongst positive management factors, were ridden with loose reins and low hands. Thus, one can wonder whether horses may positively perceive work or parts of it. Indicators of positive emotions are poorly known yet but we recently found that, out of the working context, a non-vocal acoustic signal, snorts, could reflect mild positive emotions in horses. We hypothesized that snorts could help identifying the working phases and actions appreciated by horses. An overview of snort production in 127 horses spread over 16 riding schools was first conducted to highlight a potential site effect. Results show a great difference in snorts frequency between facilities which may be due to different riding techniques. In order to test this hypothesis, we then focused on 37 horse-rider dyads by scoring horses' postures (neck) and riders' positions (hand, reins) during, but also out of the context of snort production. Results show that snorts were particularly associated with phases when the rider technique, i.e. long and loose reins, allowed more comfort for the horse, especially<sep>Attention is a central process of cognition and influences the execution of daily tasks. In humans, different types of work require different attentional skills and sport performance is associated with the ability to attention shift. Attention towards humans varies in dogs used for different types of work. Whether this variation is due to the recruitment of individuals suitable for specific types of work, or to the characteristics of the work, remains unclear. In the present study, we hypothesized that domestic horses ( Equus caballus ) trained for different types of work would also demonstrate different attentional characteristics but we also explored other possible factors of influence such as age, sex and breed. We exposed more than sixty horses, working in 4 different disciplines, and living in two types of housing conditions, to a visual attention test (VAT) performed in the home environment. Individual attentional characteristics in the test were not significantly influenced by age, sex, breed or conditions of life but were strongly related to the type of work. Riding school horses showed longer sequences and less fragmented attention than all other horses, including sport horses living in the same conditions. Interestingly, sport performance was correlated with attention fragmentation during the test in eventing horses, which may need more attention shifting during the competitions. Working<sep>Despite a growing body of research on perinatal sensory abilities, data on the extent of tactile sensitivity and more particularly passive touch (i.e. sensitivity to a stimulation imposed on the skin) are relatively limited, and the development and processing of tactile function are still thus little known. This question is particularly of high importance for infants with atypical early development such as those born prematurely who are exposed to many sensory (including tactile) stimulations (being in a hospital setting) during a critical period of brain development and those born at early term whose birth occurs at the precise time of cortical reorganization, in particular in the sensory areas. Some parents and health-care providers have for instance reported that children born prematurely exhibit atypical (e.g. higher) sensitivity to “benign” tactile stimuli. In the present study, we hypothesized that preterm and early-term infants may show altered tactile sensitivity. We compared the behavioral responses around term-equivalent age of infants born either pre-term, early-term or at term to the application of a light (0.008 grams) mechanical stimulus. We found that almost all preterm infants perceive this tactile stimulus, contrarily to the two other groups of infants. This extreme tactile sensitivity may be due to experiential, maturational or more likely both processes. We also compared the tactile sensitivity of these<sep>Despite the spatial and social restrictions it causes, single stall housing still prevails in sport and riding school horses, leading to the emergence of abnormal behaviours such as stereotypic or abnormal repetitive behaviours (SB/ARB). In the present study, we investigated the impact of the type (visual/tactile) and amount of social information that could be exchanged (i.e. distance between the individuals) on the expression of welfare indicators, including, but not limited to, STB. Additional observations were made on the production of snorts, recently described as a potential indicator of positive emotions, according to the type of stall horses were housed in. Two complementary studies were performed. One observational study on 32 sport horses, all living in the same place, being of the same breed and sex, whose aim was to compare the behaviours of horses maintained for a long time in two types of stalls differing mostly in the possibilities of contact with close neighbours versus looking outdoors. The second, experimental study, consisted in moving purebred Arab broodmares from one condition to another randomly every day for 66 days, the two types of stalls differing only by the possibility or not to put the head outside above the open top half door. The results show clear statistical relations between stall architecture and horses’ behaviour, especially STB,<sep>Assessing welfare of horses, which is a particularly critical point in terms of ethics, safety and performance, is still under debated. Although, clear behavioral and postural indicators have been validated, their use remains restricted to persons trained to observational techniques and the physiological parameters used so far gave contradictory results. Furthermore, these indicators concern particularly horses' ill-being. Therefore, in order to assess clearly and simply horses' welfare we need objective markers that can be used by non-specialists. Recently, it has been shown that a horse in a good welfare level seems to be quiet and attentive to its environment. The telemetric EEG headset developed in our lab allowed us to show that horse attentional state can alter the EEG profile (proportion of brain waves). In the light of these results we hypothesize that welfare may also alter EEG profile and that EEG profile may become a good objective physiological marker of welfare. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed EEG recordings on two populations of horses living in two different environment and presenting different welfare levels. One population was living in riding center with restricted conditions (single stalls, limited access to roughage…) and the other population was living in naturalistic conditions (stable groups, pasture with grass or hay adlibitum…). The welfare of these horses<sep>Horses, and in particular sport horses, remain housed predominantly in single stalls. One of the main reported reasons is the fear that they will become agitated and injure themselves and thereby impair their performance if released in paddocks. The hour spent daily at work is also assumed to be sufficient to satisfy the horses’ needs for locomotion. Growing scientific evidence shows that single stall housing has negative consequences on horses’ welfare and that time for free movement is necessary. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of allowing sport horses used to staying permanently in their stall (except for 1 h riding/day) daily free time in a paddock and to evaluate its potential impact on their welfare using two behavioural reliable indicators (stereotypic behaviours and ear position), as well as selected blood parameters (blood cell count, oxytocin and serotonin concentrations). Two experiments were conducted on the same site. The first experiment evaluated sport horses’ habituation to the novel situation of daily sessions in a paddock, and recorded welfare indicators in their stall before and during the experiment, comparing horses that were taken outdoors (experimental) and those that stayed in their stall (control). The second experiment evaluated the impact of this daily free time in a paddock on horses’ welfare and its durability, focusing on positive<sep>Assessing the animal welfare state is a challenge given the subjective individual cognitive and emotional processing involved. Electroencephalography (EEG) spectrum analysis has proved an ecologically valid recording situation to assess the link between brain processes and affective or cognitive states in humans: a higher slow wave/fast wave ratio has been associated with a positive internal state. In particular, a high production of theta power (3−8 Hz) has been related to positive emotions. On the other hand, it has been hypothesized that a left hemisphere (LH) dominance may be associated with a better welfare state. Here, we test the hypothesis that individual differences in the resting-state quantitative EEG power spectrum of adult horses (N = 18) and its lateralization pattern may reflect individual subjective perception of their conditions of life and welfare state. The results show clear individual differences in the proportions of the different waves and their inter-hemispheric distribution. Three different EEG power spectrum profiles were highlighted, from a bilateral predominance of theta waves in horses in a more positive welfare state to a bilateral predominance of beta waves in horses with clear expressions of compromised welfare. Interestingly, particular correlations were found between wave power activity and welfare parameters. We found a negative correlation between the number of stereotypic behaviours per hour and the median</abstract>", "<keyword>Operator (biology)<sep>Stress (linguistics)<sep>Measure (data warehouse)<sep>Management system<sep>Augmented reality<sep>Empathy<sep>Memory test<sep>Competence (human resources)<sep>Information privacy<sep>Control (management)<sep>Domain (mathematical analysis)<sep>Relevance (law)<sep>Requirements elicitation<sep>Personally identifiable information<sep>Ontology<sep>Lean manufacturing<sep>Manufacturing<sep>Matching (statistics)<sep>Face perception<sep>Quality management<sep>Perception<sep>Trait<sep>Task (project management)<sep>Wearable computer<sep>Sharing economy<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Key (lock)<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Lean project management<sep>Interdependence<sep>Digitization<sep>Affordance<sep>Distrust<sep>Encoding (memory)<sep>Facial recognition system<sep>Digital transformation<sep>Industry 4.0<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Information flow<sep>Natural (archaeology)<sep>Thermal<sep>Tacit knowledge<sep>Valence (chemistry)<sep>Set (abstract data type)<sep>Attractiveness<sep>Work (physics)<sep>Cognition<sep>Realm<sep>Supply chain<sep>Exploit<sep>Heat stress<sep>Recognition memory<sep>Trustworthiness<sep>Facilitator<sep>Impression formation<sep>Correlation<sep>Dominance (genetics)<sep>Maturity (psychological)<sep>Flexibility (engineering)<sep>Facial expression<sep>Deconstruction (building)<sep>Dashboard<sep>Face (sociological concept)<sep>Production (economics)</keyword><title>Requirements for adopting digital B2B platforms for manufacturing capacity finding and sharing<sep>Situation Awareness for Effective Production Control<sep>Evaluation of Augmented Reality in Industry<sep>Human-Centered Manufacturing Challenges Affecting European Industry 4.0 Enabling Technologies<sep>An Assessment Tool for Digital Enhancement of Operators on the Production Shop Floor<sep>Applying Co-creation Principles to Requirement Elicitation in Manufacturing<sep>Augmenting the Production Operators for Continuous Improvement<sep>Nose Heat: Exploring Stress-induced Nasal Thermal Variability through\n  Mobile Thermal Imaging<sep>Nose Heat: Exploring Stress-induced Nasal Thermal Variability through Mobile Thermal Imaging<sep>Designing a Privacy Dashboard for a Smart Manufacturing Environment<sep>ALF - a Framework for Evaluating Accelerated Learning in Industry<sep>ALF - A Framework for Evaluating Accelerated Learning and Cognitive Skills Development in Industry Through Games<sep>Combining Traits Into a Face: A Reverse Correlation Approach<sep>Co-created evaluation: Identifying how games support police learning<sep>Insights from a Digital Lean Startup: Co-creating Digital Tools for Cognitive Augmentation of the Worker<sep>Good to Bad or Bad to Bad?

The study aims to contribute to wider adoption of such platforms among real life companies.<sep>Situation awareness is a growing need for manufacturing operators with the digital transformation of manufacturing environments where operators are expected to take larger responsibilities and tasks on the production flow. To make effective production control decisions, workers need to be aware of the situation that consists of multiple factors such as the production status, and internal and external demand requirements. Adapting existing models for situation awareness, this paper presents four case examples of manufacturing companies that implement digital technologies for situation awareness.<sep>Augmented Reality (AR) is seen as a key technology for the development of smart manufacturing. Despite the many possibilities and affordances of this emerging technology, it is a fairly new technology in industry without widespread adoption.

Based on literature and a case study, we propose guidelines for evaluating AR based on identified dimensions.<sep>Industry 4.0 implies the digitization of the shopfloor combining technologies such as sensors, augmented reality, and wearable robots that transform the manufacturing environment into a workplace where human-machine interactive symbiosis.

This paper presents two cases based on two European research projects encompassing representatives of different industrial sectors and distils the challenges encountered that raise barriers to wider adoption.<sep>The Operator 4.0 represents a recent paradigm within the transformation potential heralded by Industry 4.0. Since there is a lack of practice-oriented tools, grounded in sound theory, to implement the Operator 4.0 successfully, this paper presents the assessment tool developed within the \\xABDigitally Enhanced Operator\\xBB project. The tool covers 3 areas of analysis (i.e., Work Organization & Shop Floor Characteristics, Situation Awareness & Decision Making, Technological Support), a set of dimensions and a four-level maturity scale. This work contributes to advance knowledge and to help manufacturers consider the Organizational, Human and Technological aspects in their journey to Industry 4.0.<sep>This paper presents an industrial case of applying co-creation principles for the design of smart industry 4.0 solution within the context of three distinct end-user organizations ranging from aeronautics, robot and furniture manufacturing. The purpose was to develop a digital solution that monitors the operators and their environment to recognise the context and determine whether an operator requires support, subsequently triggering the most appropriate interventions for the operator to excel at their work whilst maintaining their well-being. The paper documents the process followed, results and lessons learnt in applying co-creation principles in the elicitation of requirements in human centered manufacturing work environments.<sep>This paper discusses how continuous improvement activities can be supported by augmenting the operators in production. After a brief literature background, real life case examples from manufacturing companies are provided and discussed. Enabling technologies, specifically AR and embedded sensors, can guide the operators in execution of their tasks, quality verification of work done step by step, and data collection from both manual and automated operations in much higher levels of details. Collected data provides an empirical foundation for data-driven analysis and improvement potentials in production and quality operations. The paper contributes to theory and practice by providing research-based innovation experiences on this emerging topic of interest for manufacturing companies.<sep>Automatically monitoring and quantifying stress-induced thermal dynamic information in real-world settings is an extremely important but challenging problem. In this paper, we explore whether we can use mobile thermal imaging to measure the rich physiological cues of mental stress that can be deduced from a person's nose temperature. To answer this question we build i) a framework for monitoring nasal thermal variable patterns continuously and ii) a novel set of thermal variability metrics to capture a richness of the dynamic information. We evaluated our approach in a series of studies including laboratory-based psychosocial stress-induction tasks and real-world factory settings. We demonstrate our approach has the potential for assessing stress responses beyond controlled laboratory settings.<sep>Automatically monitoring and quantifying stress-induced thermal dynamic information in real-world settings is an extremely important but challenging problem.

This data likely also contains references to actions of a single worker, which can be considered personal data. Privacy dashboards convey information on what personal data is stored by a system and provide means for users of a system to control what personal data is shared according to their needs. Dashboards put the control over their personal data in the hands of the users. However, to act as a trust building component, the dashboard needs to convey or mediate the trade-off between the user’s privacy and the benefits of data sharing. This work describes the design process and an elicitation of preliminary requirements for a privacy dashboard that is developed in the context of the H2020 project HUMAN Manufacturing.<sep>Games have long been considered as a means to support effective learning, motivate learners and accelerate their learning. Several successful studies using game-based learning are reported in the literature. However, there appears to be a research gap on systematically evaluating accelerated learning in game environments. The main research question we address in this paper is how can we evaluate accelerated learning in game-based learning environments? The main contribution of this paper will be a framework for evaluating accelerated learning in games (ALF). We will illustrate the use of this framework by describing studies conducted in the Norwegian industrial project ALTT (Accelerate Learning Through Technology), aimed at capacity building in the aluminium industry, where we have co-designed a game for accelerating learning about the electrolysis process for extracting aluminium and heat balance in the aluminium production cells.<sep>Games have long been considered as a means to support effective learning, motivate learners and accelerate their learning.

However, because the focus has typically been on the verbal output of the formed impressions, little is known about how impressions resulting from different trait combinations impact perceivers' expectations about facial content. Here, we offer initial evidence about how trait integration occurs in social face perception. In two studies, we used a reverse correlation paradigm to obtain face images reflecting participants' expectations about facial content for different trait combinations of dominance and trustworthiness. Analyses of the physical and perceived content of these images suggest that: (a) trustworthiness information outweighs dominance information in expectations about facial content; and (b) the face content derived from any trait combination contains information that goes beyond the content associated with each separate trait. These findings extend the research on trait integration to social face perception.<sep>HCI often produces improved systems through co-creation with practitioners. However, evaluation methods are primarily researcher-led (i.e., not co-created with practitioners). As part of a games-based learning evaluation, we detail a novel co-creation method that produces evaluations on how technology influences learning. Based upon educational threshold concept theories, the Tricky Topic method supported the co-creation of knowledge-based evaluation questionnaires with trainers. The evaluation involved 116 new recruit police officers from three UK police forces who participated in a randomized-control trial. The Tricky Topic method provided insights of how the game significantly increased understanding p< .001 (moderate effect size) in comparison with face-to-face training. Tricky topic breakdowns identify increased tacit understanding (e.g., empathy, attention) after games training, and decreased tacit understanding (e.g., respect) after face-to face training. Finally, further research opportunities are discussed concerning co-created evaluation for valid and relevant deconstruction of participants’ understanding that allow designers to pinpoint systems-specific learning benefits.<sep>Lean Startup is described as the application of lean thinking to the process of innovation, where a process of validated learning allows entrepreneurs to develop and test their products through frequent experiments. Such learning capabilities remain critical as we progress into an era of digitalization, where an abundance of data promises to advance the way in which many organizations develop problem-solving capabilities to learn to do better business. Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide insight into how the lean startup methodology can be used to develop digital solutions which enable manufacturers to better solve their problem-solving problems in the digital era. We present insights from an innovative new startup company that has adopted the lean startup methodology to develop an augmented reality solution that promises to support and enhance the problem-solving capabilities of the operators of the future. The insights have relevance for both practitioners and researchers.<sep>Abstract In this article we directly assessed the relationship between valence and relevant traits of the Big Two dimensions (i.e., communion and agency). Drawing on previous research, we expected that the relationship with valence would be less monotonous and more variable in direction across agency‐related traits, compared to communion‐related traits. In three repeated measures studies we assessed the perceived valence of each trait dimension on a continuum of seven points. Studies 1 and 2 defined each continuum verbally. In Study 3 each continuum was defined by facial features. Results across these studies show that valence is linearly and more consistently related with communion‐related traits than with agency‐related traits. Within agency, however, competence established a positive linear relationship with valence, whereas dominance showed a target‐sensitive relationship with valence: quadratic in evaluation of trait concepts, and negative and linear in face evaluation. We discuss the implications of these data for Big Two‐related research.<sep>As a pandemic spread throughout the world in 2020, restricting possibilities of physical presence, ‘going digital’ became acutely necessary for analogue serious game providers. Digitalization of analogue serious games based on player interaction is an arduous task requiring a substantial rethinking of the relationship between players, the facilitator(s), the game, and technology. Empirical research on the matter is inadequate, leaving practitioners without proper guidance in carrying out the digitalization process. This paper presents a novel framework, called the ‘Participant Centred Framework’, that can aid in moving from the analogue to the digital medium. The framework consists of several categories of relationships we believe instrumental in reimagining games for the digital realm. For each of these categories, several factors or topics to consider are included. The Participant Centred Framework is presented alongside a detailing of what we learned during our own, iterative digitalization process – mapped to the categories and factors of the framework.<sep>Abstract The article explores whether the traits representing the dimensions underlying the structure of facial and non‐facial impressions are similarly mapped in the face space. Two studies examine whether the trustworthiness‐by‐dominance and the warmth‐by‐competence two‐dimensional models overlap in face perception. In Study 1 ( N = 200), we used a reverse‐correlation task to obtain classification images ( CI s) reflecting how each dimension is mapped onto a face. Results show that the similarity between CI s was higher between warmth and trustworthiness than between competence and dominance. In Study 2 ( N = 31) the evaluations of each CI on each social dimension show a higher dissociation between dominance and competence than between trustworthiness and warmth. These results, obtained at both perceptual and judgment levels, suggest that there is only a partial correspondence between the two models that seems to be driven by the relationship that the competence and dominance dimensions establish with valence.<sep>Recognizing the role that facial appearance plays in guiding social interactions, here we investigated how occlusions of the bottom-face region affect facial impressions of trustworthiness and dominance. Previous studies suggesting that different facial features impact inferences on these traits sustain the hypothesis that wearing a face mask will differently affect each trait inference. And specifically, that trustworthiness impressions will be more disrupted by this type of face occlusion than dominance impressions. In two studies, we addressed this possibility by occluding the bottom face region of faces that were previously shown to convey different levels of dominance and trustworthiness, and tested differences in the ability to discriminate between these trait levels across occlusion conditions. In Study 1 faces were occluded by a mask, and in Study 2 by a square image. In both studies, results showed that although facial occlusions generally reduced participants' confidence on their trait judgments, the ability to discriminate facial trustworthiness was more strongly affected than the ability to discriminate facial dominance. Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.<sep>Within supply chains, companies have difficulties in finding suppliers outside their known supplier pool or geographical areas. The EU project MANUSQUARE aims to deploy a marketplace to match supply and demand of supply chain resources to facilitate accurate and efficient matchmaking. To this end, a semantic matching algorithm has been developed as one of the key enablers of such a marketplace. The algorithm exploits formal descriptions of resources provided by an ontology developed in the project and will later be extended to incorporate additional data from different endpoints. This paper describes the main components of the semantic matching algorithm, which on the basis of the formally described supply chain resources returns a ranked list of relevant suppliers given a customer query. The paper further describes a comparative evaluation of a set of common semantic similarity techniques that was conducted in order to identify the most appropriate technique for our purpose. The results from the evaluation show that all four techniques perform pretty well and are able to distinguish relevant suppliers from irrelevant ones. The best performing technique is the edge-based technique Wu-Palmer.<sep>Designing games for learning in the workplace is challenging in many ways. Within the process industry, the aluminium production cells are harsh environments that are difficult to instrument and pose domain related challenges, which make effective training difficult to achieve. In particular, cognitive challenges arise due to the slow nature of the physical process that disconnects the operators' actions and causality. The complex chemical process demands a high level of understanding of the parameters and their complex interdependencies. Additional challenges are related to representing an appropriate level of detail and precision of the workplace, including integration with existing tools. This paper describes the digital simulation game designed and developed for the operators in aluminium plants to master the cognitive skills required for Heat Balance in the aluminium production cells. A co-design process was adopted from the initial inception of the idea, development and evaluation. The paper will discuss and present the co-creation artefacts used, namely a paper prototype, hybrid prototype of the game along with the output from iterative development cycles. This work is conducted within the research and innovation project, Accelerated Learning for Technology Transfer, with the Norwegian company Hydro.<sep>Operators in industrial manufacturing environments are under pressure to cope with the ever increasing flexibility and complexity of work. Transitioning towards data-driven smart manufacturing environments in the context of Industry 4.0 with wearable technologies and sensors brings the opportunity to (1) use the recorded data to deliver timely assistance to the operator and (2) employ it in retrospective for work process optimisation. Despite these clear opportunities challenges are raised concerning the perceived threats of the usage of the data that outweigh the perceived benefits. Thus, it is paramount to strongly consider privacy concerns when designing a system for a smart manufacturing environments from the onset rather than an afterthought. This paper presents a trust and privacy framework to address these challenges by facilitating the understanding of the role of trust and privacy in complex smart manufacturing systems. The framework is instantiated in the context of a smart manufacturing system developed in the EU H2020 HUMAN project and evaluated in three studies towards its perceived usefulness and its impact on the privacy awareness in a concrete smart manufacturing application scenario. The evaluation results show that the framework helps to structure and understand the data-flow in a smart manufacturing scenario from a privacy perspective.<sep>Artificial intelligence increasingly plays a crucial role in daily life. At the same time, artificial intelligence is often met with reluctance and distrust. Previous research demonstrated that faces that are visibly artificial are considered to be less trustworthy and remembered less accurately compared to natural faces. Current technology, however, enables the generation of artificial faces that are indistinguishable from natural faces. In five experiments (total N = 867), we tested whether natural faces that are merely labelled to be artificial are also trusted less. A meta-analysis of all five experiments suggested that natural faces merely labeled as being artificial were judged to be less trustworthy. This bias did not depend on the degree of trustworthiness and attractiveness of the faces (Experiments 1-3). It was not modulated by changing raters’ attitude towards artificial intelligence (Experiments 2-3) or by information communicated by the faces (Experiment 4). We also did not observe differences in recall performance between faces labelled as artificial or natural (Experiment 3). When participants only judged one type of face (i.e., either labelled as artificial or natural), the difference in trustworthiness judgments was eliminated (Experiment 5) suggesting that the contrast between the natural and artificial categories in the same task promoted the labelling effect. We conclude that faces that are merely labelled to be artificial are trusted less in situations that also include faces labelled to be real. We propose that understanding and changing social evaluations towards artificial intelligence goes beyond eliminating physical differences between artificial and natural entities.<sep>Abstract Previous research has mostly approached face recognition and target identification by focusing on face perception mechanisms, but memory mechanisms also appear to play a role. Here, we examined how the presence of a mask interferes with the memory mechanisms involved in face recognition, focusing on the dynamic interplay between encoding and recognition processes. We approach two known memory effects: (a) matching study and test conditions effects (i.e., by presenting masked and/or unmasked faces) and (b) testing expectation effects (i.e., knowing in advance that a mask could be put on or taken off). Across three experiments using a yes/no recognition paradigm, the presence of a mask was orthogonally manipulated at the study and the test phases. All data showed no evidence of matching effects. In Experiment 1, the presence of masks either at study or test impaired the correct identification of a target. But in Experiments 2 and 3, in which the presence of masks at study or test was manipulated within participants, only masks presented at test-only impaired face identification. In these conditions, test expectations led participants to use similar encoding strategies to process masked and unmasked faces. Across all studies, participants were more liberal (i.e., used a more lenient criterion) when identifying masked faces presented at the test. We discuss these results and propose that to better understand how people may identify a face wearing a mask, researchers should take into account that memory is an active process of discrimination, in which expectations regarding test conditions may induce an encoding strategy that enables overcoming perceptual deficits.</abstract>", "<keyword>Real estate<sep>Intermediary<sep>Spillover effect<sep>Renting<sep>Apartment<sep>Shock (circulatory)<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Funding liquidity<sep>Market liquidity<sep>Securitization<sep>Financial intermediary</keyword><title>Mortgage Securitization and Shadow Bank Lending<sep>Finance and the supply of housing quality<sep>Financial Intermediaries as Suppliers of Housing Quality</title><abstract>Abstract We show how securitization affects the size of the nonbank lending sector through a novel price-based channel. We identify the channel using a regulatory spillover shock to the cross-section of mortgage-backed security prices: the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio. The shock increases secondary market prices for FHA-insured loans by granting them favorable regulatory status once securitized. Higher prices lower nonbanks’ funding costs, prompting them to loosen lending standards and originate more FHA-insured loans. This channel accounts for 22% of nonbanks’ growth in overall mortgage market share over 2013–2015. While the shock creates risks for financial stability, homeownership also increases.<sep>I show how financial intermediaries affect rental housing quality and affordability by supplying real estate investors with financing for quality improvement projects (i.e., renovations). First, I document a historic surge in improvement activity since the Great Recession. Then, using exogenous variation generated by a 2015 change in regulatory capital requirements, I find that a reallocation of bank credit toward improvement projects accounts for 24% of quality improvements since 2015. The shock increases the supply of high-quality apartments and lowers their rent. However, it raises the average apartment’s rent and accounts for 32% of historically high rent growth over 2015–16.<sep>I show how financial intermediaries affect rental housing quality and affordability by supplying real estate investors with financing for quality improvement projects (i.e., renovations).

fb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s} = $ 13 TeV $pp$ collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. No significant deviation from the Standard Model is observed and upper limits are placed on the production cross-section times branching ratio to two photons as a function of the resonance mass.<sep>The $t\\bar{t}$ production cross-section is measured in the lepton+jets channel using proton$-$proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. Events with exactly one charged lepton and four or more jets in the final state, with at least one jet containing $b$-hadrons, are used to determine the $t\\bar{t}$ production cross-section through a profile-likelihood fit. The inclusive cross-section is measured to be ${\\sigma_{\\text{inc}} = 830 \\pm 0.4~ \\text{(stat.)}\\pm 36~\\text{(syst.)}\\pm 14~\\text{(lumi.)}~\\mathrm{pb}}$ with a relative uncertainty of 4.6 %.

A sample corresponding to 126 fb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV proton-proton collision data, collected with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, is analyzed utilizing an adversarial neural network for event classification. The signal strength, defined as the ratio of the measured signal yield to that predicted by the Standard Model for VBF Higgs production, is measured to be $0.95^{+0.38}_{-0.36}$, corresponding to an observed (expected) significance of 2.6 (2.8) standard deviations from the background only hypothesis. The results are additionally combined with an analysis of Higgs bosons decaying to $b$-quarks, produced via VBF in association with a photon.<sep>A measurement of fiducial and differential cross-sections for $W^+W^-$ production in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $36.1$ fb$^{-1}$ is presented. Events with one electron and one muon are selected, corresponding to the decay of the diboson system as $WW\\rightarrow e^{\\pm}\\nu\\mu^{\\mp}\\nu$. To suppress top-quark background, events containing jets with a transverse momentum exceeding 35 GeV are not included in the measurement phase space. The fiducial cross-section, six differential distributions and the cross-section as a function of the jet-veto transverse momentum threshold are measured and compared with several theoretical predictions. Constraints on anomalous electroweak gauge boson self-interactions are also presented in the framework of a dimension-six effective field theory.<sep>A search for the $Z\\gamma$ decay of the Higgs boson, with $Z$ boson decays into pairs of electrons or muons is presented. The analysis uses proton$-$proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The observed data are consistent with the expected background with a $p$-value of 1.3%. An upper limit at 95% confidence level on the production cross-section times the branching ratio for $pp\\to H\\to Z\\gamma$ is set at 3.6 times the Standard Model prediction while 2.6 times is expected in the presence of the Standard Model Higgs boson.

Long-lived particles occur in many extensions to the Standard Model and may elude searches for new promptly decaying particles. The analysis considers neutral, long-lived scalars with masses between 5 and 400 GeV, produced from decays of heavy bosons with masses between $$125$$ and $$1000$$ GeV, where the long-lived scalars decay into Standard Model fermions. The analysis uses either $$10.8~{\\hbox {fb}}^{-1}$$ or $$33.0~{\\hbox {fb}}^{-1}$$ of data (depending on the trigger) recorded in 2016 at the LHC with the ATLAS detector in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

The considered signature is based upon high ionization in the transition radiation tracker of the inner detector associated with a pencil-shape energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The data were collected by a dedicated trigger based on the tracker high-threshold hit capability. The results are interpreted in models of Drell-Yan pair production of stable particles with two spin hypotheses (0 and $1/2$) and masses ranging from 200 to 4000 GeV.

The photons are required to be isolated and have a transverse momentum of $p_\\mathrm{T,\\gamma_{1(2)}} > 40(30)$ GeV for the leading (sub-leading) photon. The differential cross sections as functions of several observables for the diphoton system are measured and compared with theoretical predictions from state-of-the-art Monte Carlo and fixed-order calculations. The QCD predictions from next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations and multi-leg merged calculations are able to describe the measured integrated and differential cross sections within uncertainties, whereas lower-order calculations show significant deviations, demonstrating that higher-order perturbative QCD corrections are crucial for this process.

The measurements are performed in a fiducial volume defined at parton level.

Dedicated techniques were developed for the reconstruction of displaced jets produced by LLPs decaying hadronically in the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter. Two search regions are defined for different LLP kinematic regimes. The observed numbers of events are consistent with the expected background, and limits for several benchmark signals are determined. For a SM Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV, branching ratios above 10% are excluded at 95% confidence level for values of c times LLP mean proper lifetime in the range between 20 mm and 10 m depending on the model. Upper limits are also set on the cross-section times branching ratio for scalars<sep>A search for high-mass dielectron and dimuon resonances in the mass range of 250 GeV to 6 TeV is presented. The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. A functional form is fitted to the dilepton invariant-mass distribution to model the contribution from background processes, and a generic signal shape is used to determine the significance of observed deviations from this background estimate. No significant deviation is observed and upper limits are placed at the 95% confidence level on the fiducial cross-section times branching ratio for various resonance width hypotheses. The derived limits are shown to be applicable to spin-0, spin-1 and spin-2 signal hypotheses. For a set of benchmark models, the limits are converted into lower limits<sep>A bstract Constraints on selected mediator-based dark matter models and a scalar dark energy model using up to 37 fb −1 $$ \\sqrt{s} $$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math> = 13 TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2015-2016 are summarised in this paper.

This division is used to construct observables that characterize the longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions of the $b$ hadron within the jet. The measurements have been corrected for detector effects and provide a test of heavy-quark-fragmentation modeling at the LHC in a system where the top-quark decay products are color connected to the proton beam remnants. The unfolded distributions are compared with the predictions of several modern Monte Carlo parton-shower generators and generator tunes,<sep>Jet energy scale and resolution measurements with their associated uncertainties are reported for jets using 36-81 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Jets are reconstructed using two different input types: topo-clusters formed from energy deposits in calorimeter cells, as well as an algorithmic combination of charged-particle tracks with those topo-clusters, referred to as the ATLAS particle-flow reconstruction method. The anti-$k_t$ jet algorithm with radius parameter $R=0.4$ is the primary jet definition used for both jet types. Jets are initially calibrated using a sequence of simulation-based corrections. Next, several $\\textit{in situ}$ techniques are employed to correct for differences between data and simulation and to measure the resolution of jets.

Events are classified according to their final state into many event classes. For each event class an automated search algorithm tests whether the data are compatible with the Monte Carlo simulated expectation in several distributions sensitive to the effects of new physics. The significance of a deviation is quantified using pseudo-experiments. A data selection with a significant deviation defines a signal region for a dedicated follow-up analysis with an improved background expectation. The analysis of the data-derived signal regions on a new dataset allows a statistical interpretation without the large look-elsewhere effect. The sensitivity of the approach is discussed using Standard Model processes and benchmark signals of new physics.

Events with missing transverse momentum and two same-flavor, oppositely charged, low transverse momentum leptons are selected, and are further categorized by the presence of hadronic activity from initial-state radiation or a topology compatible with vector-boson fusion processes. The data are found to be consistent with predictions from the Standard Model. The results are interpreted using simplified models of $R$-parity-conserving supersymmetry in which the lightest supersymmetric partner is a neutralino with a mass similar to the lightest chargino, the second-to-lightest neutralino or the slepton. Lower limits on the masses of charginos in different simplified models range from 193 GeV to 240 GeV for moderate mass splittings, and<sep>A bstract A direct search for Higgs bosons produced via vector-boson fusion and subsequently decaying into invisible particles is reported.

Among all processes related to vector-boson scattering, the electroweak production of two jets and a Z-boson pair is a rare and important one. Here we report the observation of this process from proton–proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb−1 recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. We consider two different final states originating from the decays of the Z-boson pair: one containing four charged leptons and another containing two charged leptons and two neutrinos.

Three final states, classified by the number of leptons, are analysed: two same-sign leptons, three leptons, and four leptons. No significant excess over the expected Standard Model backgrounds is observed. An observed (expected) 95% confidence-level upper limit of 160 (120) times the Standard Model prediction of non-resonant Higgs pair production cross-section is set from a combined analysis of the three final states.

The WZ fully leptonic channel has been extensively studied by the ATLAS Collaboration at the LHC and we are about to provide results using the full Run 2 data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb −1 . The EWK production of the WZ in association with two jets has been already observed at 36 fb −1 with an observed significance of 5.3 standard deviations.

Today, the extended panel of mass spectrometric approaches, accompanied by newly developed sample preparation methods is a strategy of choice for responder and non-responder stratification on a molecular basis, and early detection of resistance.

When aiming to reach molecular heterogeneity of cells at extremely low spatial scales, single-cell analysis can be the ultimate choice. Proteomics performed in bulk population of cells (macroproteomics) is prone to mask molecular heterogeneity. Mass spectrometry-based single cell proteomics (SCP-MS) is the right solution to overcome this issue. Three main problems can be identified using SCP-MS: (i) analytical loss during sample preparation, (ii) inefficient microinjection/delivery of proteins/peptides from samples to MS and (iii) low analytical throughput.

During the last two decades, several molecules targeting RTKs were used in oncology as a first or second line therapy in different types of cancer.

In this review, we summarize the main features of RTKs and their inhibitors (RTKIs), their current use in oncology, and mechanisms of resistance. We also describe the technological advances of artificial intelligence, chemoproteomics, and microfluidics in elaborating powerful strategies that could be used in providing more efficient and selective small molecules inhibitors of RTKs.

The possibility to implement these approaches for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic investigations in early phase clinical trials depends on the ability to validate quantification assays according to regulatory guidelines (e.g., US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency) for bioanalytical method validation. However, these guidelines were designed for the validation of liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) methods and ligand binding assays. To apply the validation parameters to DI-MS methods (also referred here as on-surface MS) for drug quantification, it is important to consider<sep>Quantitative monitoring of biologically active methylations of guanines in samples exposed to temozolomide (TMZ) would be useful in glioblastoma research for preclinical TMZ experiments, for clinical pharmacology questions regarding appropriate exposure, and ultimately for precision oncology. The known biologically active alkylation of DNA induced by TMZ takes place on O6 position of guanines. However, when developing mass spectrometric (MS) assays, the possible signal overlap of O6-methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (O6-m2dGO) with other methylated 2'-deoxyguanosine species in DNA and methylated guanosines in RNA must be considered. Liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) offers the analytical requirements for such assays in terms of specificity and sensitivity, especially when multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is available. In<sep>Temozolomide (TMZ), together with bulk resection and focal radiotherapy, is currently a standard of care for glioblastoma. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) parameters, together with the mode of action of TMZ, make its biochemical and biological action difficult to understand. Accurate understanding of the mode of action of TMZ and the monitoring of TMZ at its anatomical, cellular, and molecular sites of action (SOAs) would greatly benefit precision medicine and the development of novel therapeutic approaches in combination with TMZ. In the present perspective article, we summarize the known ADME parameters and modes of action of TMZ, and we review the possible methodological options to monitor TMZ<sep>Summary High-throughput and streamlined workflows are essential in clinical proteomics for standardized processing of samples originating from a variety of sources, including fresh frozen tissue, FFPE tissue, or blood. To reach this goal, we have implemented single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) on a liquid handling robot for automated processing (autoSP3) of tissue lysates in a 96-well format, performing unbiased protein purification and digestion, and delivering peptides that can be directly analyzed by LCMS. AutoSP3 eliminates hands-on time and minimizes the risk of error, reduces variability in protein quantification and improves longitudinal performance and reproducibility. We demonstrate the distinguishing ability of autoSP3 to process low-input samples, reproducibly quantifying 500-1000<sep>Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) represents a considerable asset for analytics of complex samples as it allows for rapid mass spectrometric separation of compounds. IMS is even more useful for the separation of isobaric compounds when classical separation methods such as liquid chromatography or electrophoresis cannot be used, e.g., during matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) analyses of biological surfaces. In the present study, we proved the usefulness of IMS for pharmacological applications of MALDI analyses on tissue sections. To illustrate our proof-of-concept, we used the anthelmintic drug mebendazole (MBZ) as a model. Using this exemplary drug, we demonstrated the possibility of using ion mobility to discriminate a drug in tissues<sep>Over the past 40 years, proteomics, generically defined as the field dedicated to the identification and analysis of proteins, has tremendously gained in popularity and potency through advancements in genome sequencing, separative techniques, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics algorithms. As a consequence, its scope of application has gradually enlarged and diversified to meet specialized topical biomedical subjects. Although the tryptic bottom-up approach is widely regarded as the gold standard for rapid screening of complex samples, its application for precise and confident mapping of protein modifications is often hindered due to partial sequence coverage, poor redundancy in indicative peptides, and lack of method flexibility. We here show how the synergic<sep>The development of desorption/ionization (DI) mass spectrometric (MS) assays for drug quantification in tissue sections and their validation according to regulatory guidelines would enable their universalization for applications in (clinical) pharmacology. Recently, new enhancements in desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) have highlighted the reliability of this ion source for the development of targeted quantification methods that meet requirements for method validation. However, it is necessary to consider subtle parameters leading to the success of such method developments, such as the morphology of desorption spots, the analytical time, and sample surface, to cite but a few. Here, we provide additional experimental data highlighting an additional important parameter, based on the<sep>Multiple therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are currently under development or in (pre)clinical study phases to reach regulatory approval. Among these, a new mAb against herpes simplex virus, HDIT101, was recently tested in healthy volunteers during a phase I clinical trial (first-in-human, dose escalation). In the frame of the pharmacokinetic evaluation of this new therapy, a mass spectrometric (MS)-based method was developed for the quantification of HDIT101 in human plasma using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. In this work, we describe the development of this bioanalytical assay using the quantification of a HDIT101 surrogate peptide, the assay validation procedure according to the FDA guidelines within the calibration<sep>Purpose To facilitate the transition of MALDI–MS Imaging (MALDI–MSI) from basic science to clinical application, it is necessary to analyze formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded (FFPE) tissues. The aim is to improve in situ tryptic digestion for MALDI–MSI of FFPE samples and determine if similar results would be reproducible if obtained from different sites. Experimental Design FFPE tissues (mouse intestine, human ovarian teratoma, tissue microarray of tumor entities sampled from three different sites) are prepared for MALDI–MSI. Samples are coated with trypsin using an automated sprayer then incubated using deliquescence to maintain a stable humid environment. After digestion, samples are sprayed with CHCA using the same spraying device and analyzed with<sep>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has rarely been used in the field of therapeutic drug monitoring, partly because of the complexity of the ionization processes between the compounds to be quantified and the many MALDI matrices available. The development of a viable MALDI-MS method that meets regulatory guidelines for bioanalytical method validation requires prior knowledge of the suitability of (i) the MALDI matrix with the analyte class and properties for ionization, (ii) the crystallization properties of the MALDI matrix with automation features, and (iii) the MS instrumentation used to achieve sensitive and specific measurements in order to determine low pharmacological drug concentrations in biological matrices. In the<sep>Purpose Differential diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is of utmost importance for the decision making of respective therapeutic treatment strategies but in about 10–15% of cases, a clinical and histopathological assessment does not lead to a definite diagnosis. The aim of the study is to characterize proteomic differences between UC and CD. Experimental Design Microproteomics is performed on formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded colonic tissue specimens from 9 UC and 9 CD patients. Protein validation is performed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) ( n UC =51, n CD =62, n CTRL =10) followed by digital analysis. Results Microproteomic analyses reveal eight proteins with higher abundance in CD compared to<sep>MALDI MS imaging (MSI) is a powerful analytical tool for spatial peptide detection in heterogeneous tissues. Proper sample preparation is crucial to achieve high quality, reproducible measurements. Here we developed an optimized protocol for spatially resolved proteolytic peptide detection with MALDI time-of-flight MSI of fresh frozen prostate tissue sections. The parameters tested included four different tissue washes, four methods of protein denaturation, four methods of trypsin digestion (different trypsin densities, sprayers, and incubation times), and five matrix deposition methods (different sprayers, settings, and matrix concentrations). Evaluation criteria were the number of detected and excluded peaks, percentage of high mass peaks, signal-to-noise ratio, spatial localization, and average intensities of<sep>Clinical pharmacology is an important discipline for drug development aiming to define pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and optimum exposure to drugs, i.e. the concentration–response relationship and its modulators. For this purpose, information on drug concentrations at the anatomical, cellular and molecular sites of action is particularly valuable. In pharmacological assays, the limited accessibility of target cells in readily available samples (i.e. blood) often hampers mass spectrometry‐based monitoring of the absolute quantity of a compound and the determination of its molecular action at the cellular level. Recently, new sample collection methods have been developed for the specific capture of rare circulating cells, especially for the diagnosis of circulating tumour<sep>Although lymph node (LN) metastasis is an important prognostic parameter in cervical cancer, the tissue remodeling at a pre-metastatic state is poorly documented in LNs. We here identified periostin (POSTN) as a component of non-metastatic LNs by applying proteomic analyses and computerized image quantifications on LNs of patients with cervical cancer. We provide evidence for remarkable modifications of POSTN and lymphatic vessel distributions and densities in non-metastatic sentinel and metastatic human LNs, when compared to distant non-metastatic LNs. POSTN deposition at a pre-metastatic stage was demonstrated in a pre-clinical murine model (the ear sponge assay). Its expression by fibroblastic LN cells was assessed by in situ hybridization and<sep>The third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), osimertinib, has revolutionized the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutation, and resistant to first- and second-generation TKIs. Osimertinib is now also proposed as a first-line therapy, thus extending the scope of applications in lung oncology. Personalized medicine approaches are still necessary to monitor if patients are exposed to adequate concentrations of osimertinib during their treatment. It would also help to understand the appearance of new resistances in patients after several months of dosing with osimertinib. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is currently the gold standard for the quantification of drugs in plasma enabling<sep>In clinical pharmacology, drug quantification is mainly performed from the circulation for pharmacokinetic purposes. Finely monitoring the chemical effect of drugs at their chemical sites of action for pharmacodynamics would have a major impact in several contexts of personalized medicine. Monitoring appropriate drug exposure is particularly challenging for alkylating drugs such as temozolomide (TMZ) because there is no flow equilibrium that would allow reliable conclusions to be drawn about the alkylation of the target site from plasma concentrations. During the treatment of glioblastoma, it appears, therefore, promising to directly monitor the alkylating effect of TMZ rather than plasma exposure, ideally at the site of action. Mass spectrometry (MS)<sep>Targeted genetic profiling of tissue samples is paramount to detect druggable genetic aberrations in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Accurate upfront estimation of tumor cell content (TCC) is a crucial pre-analytical step for reliable testing and to avoid false-negative results. As of now, TCC is usually estimated on hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections by a pathologist, a methodology that may be prone to substantial intra- and interobserver variability. Here we the investigate suitability of digital pathology for TCC estimation in a clinical setting by evaluating the concordance between semi-automatic and conventional TCC quantification.TCC was analyzed in 120 H&E and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) stained<sep>Rationale The introduction of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) – and ambient desorption/ionization (ADI) ion sources in general – in the 2000s has opened new possibilities for mass spectrometric (MS) analyses of biological sample surfaces. DESI allows for a rapid screening of solid samples because no sample preparation is needed and the analysis is performed at atmospheric pressure. In the present study, we used DESI as an ion source for the rapid detection of a small molecule in blood droplets deposited on glass slides. Methods Blood was spiked with different concentrations of a model drug, mebendazole. One microliter blood droplets of each preparation were deposited on the surface of<sep>Tumor recurrence is a major clinical issue that represents the principal cause of cancer-related deaths, with few targetable common pathways. Mechanisms by which residual tumors persist and progress under a continuous shift between hypoxia-reoxygenation after neoadjuvent-therapy are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of lipid metabolism and tumor redox balance in tumor recurrence.Lipidomics, proteomics and mass spectrometry imaging approaches where applied to mouse tumor models of recurrence. Genetic and pharmacological inhibitions of lipid mediators in tumors were used in vivo and in functional assays in vitro.We found that stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) expressed by cancer cells and fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4) produced by tumor endothelial cells<sep>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) may arise in the intra- or extrahepatic biliary tract and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite recent advances, to date there is still no established targeted therapeutic approach available. Non-surgical therapeutic agents are urgently needed, as most patients are non-eligible to surgical resection. Anti-PD-L1 therapy prevents cancer cells from evading the immune system and has emerged as a new treatment option in several cancer entities. Recently, PD-L1 expression has been analyzed in comparably small CCA patient cohorts. However, a systematic validation of different PD-L1 antibodies has not been performed in CCA so far.We stained a tissue microarray consisting of 170 patients, including 72 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas<sep>OMICS: A Journal of Integrative BiologyVol. 24, No. 1 Letters to the EditorAdvances in Clinical Pharmacology: Rapid Detection of Small Molecules in Solid Samples at Atmospheric Pressure Using Desorption Electrospray IonizationMargaux Fresnais, Walter E.

However, the complexity of the model has made it difficult to implement in nursing research.To provide a simplified description of the model, highlight the key assumptions of dyadic data and examine the related challenges in using statistical techniques.Researchers must address certain assumptions when analysing dyadic data. They should select statistical techniques based on these assumptions and the research questions.The AIPM is the most appropriate approach for studying dyads. This article may help to create a more consistent framework for nurse researchers who incorporate the APIM into their studies.This article will help in implementing APIM in dyad-focused nursing studies by addressing key assumptions of the model and using appropriate statistical techniques.<sep>Emergency nurse's teamwork competency and readiness are crucial to improve the quality of care and patient outcome in trauma patients. This study aimed to determine teamwork competence and readiness of emergency nurses in the care of trauma patients.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 230 emergency nurses and nursing assistants in emergency departments of three university hospitals in Iran in 2020. Data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire on nurses' readiness and the nontechnical skills scale.The mean score for nurses' readiness was 3.55 ± 0.60 (maximum 5) and for nurses' teamwork competence was 3.49 ± 0.77 (maximum 5). The significant variables related to teamwork competency were gender and type of hospital. Emergency nurses with master's degrees, who had completed training courses of advanced trauma life support and triage, their source of information were from seminars' participations and clinical experiences, and worked at trauma hospital reported a higher level of readiness. Older age and higher work experiences were positively associated with readiness in emergency nurses.The significant variables associated with the teamwork competence and readiness identified in this study may be used to improve the teamwork competence and readiness of emergency nurses in emergency settings.<sep>Background The family perspective on heart failure (HF) has an important role in patients’ self-care patterns, adjustment to the disease and quality of life. Little is known about families’ experiences of living with HF, particularly in ethnic minority families. This study describes the experiences of Iranian families living with HF as an ethnic minority family in Denmark. Methods In this descriptive qualitative study, we conducted eight face-to-face joint family interviews of Iranian patients with HF and their family members living in Denmark. We used content analysis with an inductive approach for data analysis. Results We identified three categories: family daily life, process of independence and family relationships. Families were faced with physical restrictions, emotional distress and social limitations in their daily lives that threatened the patients’ independence. Different strategies were used to promote independence. One strategy was normalisation and avoiding the sick role; another strategy was accepting and adjusting themselves to challenges and limitations. The independence process itself had an impact on family relationships. Adjusting well to the new situation strengthened the relationship, while having problems in adjustment strained the relationship within the family. Conclusions This study highlights the process of independence as perceived by families living with HF. It is crucial to both families and healthcare professionals to maintain a balance between providing adequate support and ensuring independence when dealing with patients with HF. Understanding patients’ stories and their needs seems to be helpful in gaining this balance.<sep>Abstract Aims The growing hospital readmission rate among patients with heart failure (HF) has imposed a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, it is essential to identify readmission associating factors to reduce hospital readmission. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of family functioning and family health with hospital readmission rates over 6 months in patients with HF and identify the sociodemographic and/or clinical variables associated with hospital readmission. Methods and results This international multicentre cross-sectional study involved a sample of 692 patients with HF from three countries (Denmark 312, Iran 288, and Iceland 92) recruited from January 2015 to May 2020. The Family Functioning, Health, and Social Support questionnaire was used to collect the data. The number of patients’ hospital readmissions during the 6-month period was retrieved from patients’ hospital records. Of the total sample, 184 (26.6%) patients were readmitted during the 6-month period. Of these, 111 (16%) had one readmission, 68 (9.9%) had two readmissions, and 5 (0.7%) had three readmissions. Family functioning, family health, being unemployed, and country of residence were significant factors associated with hospital readmission for the patients. Conclusions This study highlights the critical roles of family functioning and family health in 6-month hospital readmission among patients with HF. Moreover, the strategy of healthcare systems in the management of HF is a key determinant that influences hospital readmission. Our findings may assist the investigation of potential strategies to reduce hospital readmission in patients with HF.<sep>Introduction: An accurate impression is essential to create a well-fitted dental prosthesis. This study aimed to compare the dimensional accuracy of three elastomeric materials using one-step and two-step impression techniques. Methods: In this study, 20 impressions were fabricated for each Vinyl siloxane ether (Identium), condensation silicone (Speedex), and additional silicone (Panasil) impression materials by the one-step and two-step impression techniques using perforated metal trays. The one-step impression technique was simultaneously performed with heavy body/light-body materials. In the two-step impression technique, acrylic copings with 2-mm thickness were placed on the abutments to obtain similar spacing for the light-body material. The dimensional accuracy of different impression materials and techniques were measured using distance differences of the stone dies from the master cast; subsequently, the results were compared with the reference model. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett’s tests (α=0.05). Results: All impression materials demonstrated an acceptable clinical accuracy. Identium (Vinyl siloxane ether) displayed the most accuracy in both the one-step and two-step impression techniques (P>0.05). The best accuracy for Panasil (additional silicone) was found to be the two-step impression technique (P>0.05), and the best accuracy for Speedex (condensation silicone) was reported as the one-step impression technique (P>0.05). Furthermore, the one-step impression technique was highly accurate in diameter dimension, as compared to the two-step impression technique. Conclusion: As evidenced by the results, the accuracy of impression is affected by the impression materials. Moreover, Identium (Vinyl siloxane ether) demonstrated the most accuracy in both one-step and two-step impression techniques.<sep>Background Endotracheal tube suctioning (ETS) is one of the most frequent procedures performed by nurses in intensive care units. Nevertheless, some suctioning practices are still being performed that do not provide any benefit for patients. Objectives To investigate the effects of minimally invasive ETS (MIETS) versus routine ETS (RETS) on physiological indices in adult intubated patients. Methods In this single centre parallel randomised controlled, open label trial, 64 adult intubated patients in the four intensive care units of Alzahra University hospital, Isfahan, Iran, were randomly allocated to a MIETS or a RETS group. Physiological indices including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were assessed immediately before, immediately after, and 10 min after ETS in both groups. The chi-square test, independent t-test, and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to analyse the data. Results Sixty-four patients were randomised and analysed. There were no significant differences in mean heart rate between the both groups across the three time points. However, there was a significant drop in peripheral oxygen saturation across the three time points in the RETS group compared to the MIETS group. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure across the three time points in the RETS group compared to the MIETS group. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that the use of MIETS has less effect on the alterations of physiological indices and consequently fewer adverse effects than RETS.<sep>Background &amp; Aim: Delirium is a frequent complication in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit following cardiac surgery. This study aimed to assess the effect of a tailored delirium preventive intervention on postoperative delirium and agitation reduction and length of intensive care unit stay in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graf.&#x0D; Methods &amp; Materials: In this single-blinded, single-center, randomized controlled design, 60 patients from a hospital in Qom, Iran, were randomly allocated to an intervention or a control group. In the control group, patients received routine care. In the intervention group, patients received routine care, a video tutorial, and the Hospital Elder Life Program. Outcomes were measured using the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, and length of intensive care unit stay in the second and third days after coronary artery bypass graft.&#x0D; Results: There were no significant differences in the rate of delirium episodes and mean scores of RASS between both groups in the second (P=0.301; P=0.125) and third days (P=0.389; P=0.057) after surgery, respectively. However, the mean duration of intensive care unit stays after surgery was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group (P=0.042).&#x0D; Conclusion: This study indicated the tailored delirium prevention intervention could reduce the length of intensive care unit stay. However, the intervention did not reduce postoperative delirium episodes, nor did the intervention improve the RASS scores in the second and third days after coronary artery bypass graft. A future large multicenter trial with long-term follow-up is needed to assess further the effect of such an intervention.<sep>Informed consent can be obtained by various methods, by various people, and with use of various types of consent forms. Persistent effort is necessary to reveal the practical realities of informed consent to improve ethical and legal standards.To determine the ethical challenges of obtaining informed consent from surgical patients.The present study was a descriptive cross-sectional study using two researcher-made questionnaires and a checklist for data collection. Data were collected from nursing personnel (n = 95) and surgical patients (n = 203) on the surgical wards of three university hospitals in Isfahan, Iran. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman's rank correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and the t-test.The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (No: 396478).The mean scores (maximum 100) of awareness, competency, and authority were 36.3, 67.7, and 57.6, respectively. The overall quality of the informed consent was poor (score 53.9 of 100). The higher educational level in patients was correlated with lower awareness of and less authority to give informed consent. Only 12.6% of the nurses stated that patients were given sufficient information to assure informed consent. In 89.2% of the consent forms, the risks of the treatment were mentioned. However, alternative methods and risks and advantages of rejecting the treatment were not mentioned in any of the forms.Ethical challenges to obtaining informed consent include patients' poor awareness of their rights, a failure to provide adequate information to patients, absence of consideration of patients' educational level, an unclear definition of who is responsible for obtaining informed consent from the patients, time constraints, and use of unclear language and medical jargon. Constructing an ethical framework may guide nursing staff in dealing with the ethical challenges involved in obtaining informed consent.<sep>Abstract Aims and objectives This study evaluates the short‐term (3 months), medium‐term (6 months) and long‐term (12 months) effect of family nursing therapeutic conversations added to conventional care versus conventional care on social support, family health and family functioning in outpatients with heart failure and their family members. Background It has been emphasised that increased social support from nurses is an important resource to strengthen family health and family functioning and thus improve the psychological well‐being of patients with heart failure and their close family members. Design A randomised multicentre trial. Methods A randomised multicentre trial adhering to the CONSORT checklist was performed in three Danish heart failure clinics. Consecutive patients ( n = 468) with family members ( n = 322) were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Participants were asked to fill out family functioning, family health and social support questionnaires. Data were measured ahead of first consultation and again after 3, 6 and 12 months. Results Social support scores increased statistically significant both at short‐term ( p = 0.002) medium‐term ( p = 0.008) and long‐term ( p = 0.018) among patients and their family members ( p = &lt;0.001; 0.007 and 0.014 respectively) in the intervention group in comparison with the control group. Both patients and their family members reported increased reinforcement, feedback, decision‐making capability and collaboration with the nurse. No significant differences between the intervention and control groups were seen in the family health and family functioning scales among patients and family members. Conclusions Family nursing therapeutic conversations were superior to conventional care in providing social support from nurses. Relevance to clinical practice Family nursing therapeutic conversations are suitable to improve the support from nurses among families living with heart failure.<sep>Abstract Aims To describe and compare family functioning, family health, and perceived social support from nurses and to identify the variables that are associated with family functioning in patients with heart failure (HF) and their family members in Denmark, Iran, and Iceland. Design An international multi‐centre cross‐sectional study. Methods A sample of 1382 participants (692 patients and 690 family members) from Denmark, Iceland, and Iran were included from January 2015 to May 2020. Data were collected using the Family Functioning, Health, and Social Support questionnaire. Results The significant factors associated with family functioning in patients were country, New York Heart Association classification (NYHA), education level, age, family health, social support, and there was a significant interaction effect between NYHA class and gender. The significant factors associated with family functioning in family members were country, education level, work status, family health, and there was a significant interaction effect between education and work status. Conclusion This study indicated that the strongest factor associated with higher family functioning was family health for both patients and family members. Women in NYHA class I and younger patients and those with an academic education had a lower level of family functioning. Moreover, unemployed family members with an elementary education and family members with elementary and high school educations who were self‐employed or employees had a lower level of family functioning. Impact This is the first international study to investigate family functioning, family health, and social support and adds to the literature on the factors associated with family functioning in patients with HF and their family members. Our findings may help nurses to identify the most vulnerable families living with HF, thereby being able to provide special support to enhance their family functioning to promote self‐management strategies.<sep>Abstract Aims and Objective To explore differences in nurses' attitudes regarding the importance of family in nursing care and factors associated with nurses' attitudes across 11 European countries. Background Family involvement in healthcare has received attention in many European healthcare systems. Nurses have a unique opportunity to promote family involvement in healthcare; however, their attitudes and beliefs may facilitate or impede this practice. Design A cross‐sectional survey across European countries. Method A broad convenience sample of 8112 nurses across 11 European countries was recruited from October 2017 to December 2019. Data were collected using the Families' Importance in Nursing Care‐Nurses' Attitudes (FINC‐NA) questionnaire. We used the STROBE checklist to report the results. Results There were significant differences in nurses' attitudes about families' importance in nursing care across Europe. Country was the factor with the strongest association with the total scores of the FINC‐NA. Older age, higher level of education, increased years since graduation, having a strategy for the care of families in the workplace, and having experience of illness within one's own family were associated with a higher total FINC‐NA score. Being male and working in a hospital or other clinical settings were associated with a lower total FINC‐NA score. Conclusion Nurses' attitudes regarding the importance of family in nursing care vary across 11 European countries. This study highlights multiple factors associated with nurses' attitudes. Further research is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the reasons for nurses' different attitudes and to develop a strong theoretical framework across Europe to support family involvement in patient care. The inclusion of family healthcare programs in the baccalaureate curriculum may improve nurses' attitudes. Relevance for clinical practice In clinical practice, the focus should be on identifying influencing factors on nurses' attitudes to enhance families' importance in nursing care across Europe.<sep>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability. This paper reviews the magnitude of total CVD burden, including 13 underlying causes of cardiovascular death and 9 related risk factors, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to 285 million) in 1990 to 523 million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1 million (95% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in 2019. The total number of DALYs due to stroke has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 143 million (95% UI: 133 to 153 million) DALYs, 6.55 million (95% UI: 6.00 to 7.02 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 101 million (95% UI: 93.2 to 111 million) prevalent cases of stroke in 2019. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of disease burden in the world. CVD burden continues its decades-long rise for almost all countries outside high-income countries, and alarmingly, the age-standardized rate of CVD has begun to rise in some locations where it was previously declining in high-income countries. There is an urgent need to focus on implementing existing cost-effective policies and interventions if the world is to meet the targets for Sustainable Development Goal 3 and achieve a 30% reduction in premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases.</abstract>", "<keyword>Senescence<sep>Progenitor cell<sep>Regenerative medicine<sep>Periosteum<sep>Nanobiotechnology<sep>MAPK/ERK pathway<sep>In vitro<sep>Kinase<sep>Reactive oxygen species<sep>Platelet-rich plasma<sep>Stromal cell<sep>Iliac crest<sep>DNA sequencing<sep>DNA damage<sep>3D printing<sep>Chitosan<sep>Inflammation<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Mesenchymal stem cell<sep>Protein kinase A<sep>Population<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Antibacterial activity<sep>Angiogenesis<sep>Cartilage<sep>DNA<sep>Scanning electron microscope<sep>Alkaline phosphatase<sep>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases<sep>Regeneration (biology)<sep>RUNX2<sep>Flow cytometry<sep>CD146<sep>Ageing<sep>Haematopoiesis<sep>Stem cell<sep>Cytotoxicity<sep>Osteoarthritis<sep>Reamer<sep>Scaffold<sep>3d printed<sep>Bone marrow<sep>Organoid<sep>3d model<sep>Tissue engineering</keyword><title>Bone Marrow Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells as Autologous Therapy for Osteonecrosis: Effects of Age and Underlying Causes<sep>Nanobiotechnology in Bone Tissue Engineering Applications: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives<sep>Fabrication and Characterisation of the Cytotoxic and Antibacterial Properties of Chitosan-Cerium Oxide Porous Scaffolds<sep>Aging, Bone Marrow and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): Recent Advances and Future Perspectives<sep>Electrospun and 3D printed polymeric materials for one-stage critical-size long bone defect regeneration inspired by the Masquelet technique: Recent Advances<sep>Revisiting p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) in Inflammatory Arthritis: A Narrative of the Emergence of MAPK-Activated Protein Kinase Inhibitors (MK2i)<sep>Organoid Models and Next-Generation Sequencing for Bone Marrow and Related Disorders<sep>Anti-Aging Potential of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP): Evidence from Osteoarthritis (OA) and Applications in Senescence and Inflammaging<sep>Evaluation of Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC) Functions on a Biomorphic Rattan-Wood-Derived Scaffold: A Comparison between Cultured and Uncultured MSCs<sep>Regulation of Angiogenesis Discriminates Tissue Resident MSCs from Effective and Defective Osteogenic Environments<sep>The Biological Fitness of Bone Progenitor Cells in Reamer/Irrigator/Aspirator Waste<sep>In Vitro Osteogenesis Study of Shell Nacre Cement with Older and Young Donor Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells<sep>Effect of Combined Intraosseous and Intraarticular Infiltrations of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma on Subchondral Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells from Patients with Hip Osteoarthritis<sep>Colony Formation, Migratory, and Differentiation Characteristics of Multipotential Stromal Cells (MSCs) from “Clinically Accessible” Human Periosteum Compared to Donor-Matched Bone Marrow MSCs<sep>The Analysis of <i>In Vivo</i> Aging in Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Using Colony-Forming Unit-Fibroblast Assay and the CD45<sup>low</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> Phenotype<sep>Bone-resident mesenchymal stromal cells in healthy ageing and osteoarthritis: enumeration and gene expression analysis in uncultured cells</title><abstract>Bone marrow (BM) is a reliable source of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have been successfully used for treating osteonecrosis. Considering the functional advantages of BM-MSCs as bone and cartilage reparatory cells and supporting angiogenesis, several donor-related factors are also essential to consider when autologous BM-MSCs are used for such regenerative therapies. Aging is one of several factors contributing to the donor-related variability and found to be associated with a reduction of BM-MSC numbers. However, even within the same age group, other factors affecting MSC quantity and function remain incompletely understood. For patients with osteonecrosis, several underlying factors have been linked to the decrease of the proliferation of BM-MSCs as well as the impairment of their differentiation, migration, angiogenesis-support and immunoregulatory functions. This review discusses the quality and quantity of BM-MSCs in relation to the etiological conditions of osteonecrosis such as sickle cell disease, Gaucher disease, alcohol, corticosteroids, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, diabetes, chronic renal disease and chemotherapy. A clear understanding of the regenerative potential of BM-MSCs is essential to optimize the cellular therapy of osteonecrosis and other bone damage conditions.<sep>Bone regeneration and repair are complex processes with the potential of added complications, like delayed repair, fracture non-union, and post-surgical infections. These conditions remain a challenge globally, pressurizing the economy and patients suffering from these conditions. Applications of nanotechnology (NBT) in the field of medicine have provided a medium for several approaches to support these global challenges. Tissue engineering is one such field that has been on the rise in the last three decades through the utilization of NBT for addressing the challenges related to bone regeneration. First, NBT enables the formation of scaffolds at the nanoscale needed for bone tissue engineering (BTE) using natural and synthetic polymers, as well as with minerals and metals. Then, it aids the development of the nano-formulation strategized to deliver antimicrobial drugs and/or growth factors through various ways to enhance bone repair through the scaffold. Third, NBT facilitates the use of specialized nanoparticles to image and track cellular events in vitro as well as in vivo. This review is an effort to bring together the current knowledge in the field of BTE and present the scope of ever-evolving NBT, a contribution towards precision medicine.<sep>Bone damage arising from fractures or trauma frequently results in infection, impeding the healing process and leading to complications. To overcome this challenge, we engineered highly porous chitosan scaffolds (S1, S2, and S3) by incorporating 30 (wt)% iron-doped dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (Fe-DCPD) minerals and different concentrations of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2) (10 (wt)%, 20 (wt)%, and 30 (wt)%) using the lyophilisation technique. The scaffolds were specifically designed for the controlled release of antibacterial agents and were systematically characterised by utilising Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy methodologies. Alterations in the physicochemical properties, encompassing pore size, swelling behaviour, degradation kinetics, and antibacterial characteristics, were observed with the escalating CeO2 concentrations. Scaffold cytotoxicity and its impact on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSCs) proliferation were assessed employing the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay. The synthesised scaffolds represent a promising approach for addressing complications associated with bone damage by fostering tissue regeneration and mitigating infection risks. All scaffold variants exhibited inhibitory effects on bacterial growth against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli strains. The scaffolds manifested negligible cytotoxic effects while enhancing antibacterial properties, indicating their potential for reducing infection risks in the context of bone injuries.<sep>The aging of bone marrow (BM) remains a very imperative and alluring subject, with an ever-increasing interest among fellow scientists. A considerable amount of progress has been made in this field with the established 'hallmarks of aging' and continued efforts to investigate the age-related changes observed within the BM. Inflammaging is considered as a low-grade state of inflammation associated with aging, and whilst the possible mechanisms by which aging occurs are now largely understood, the processes leading to the underlying changes within aged BM remain elusive. The ability to identify these changes and detect such alterations at the genetic level are key to broadening the knowledgebase of aging BM. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an important molecular-level application presenting the ability to not only determine genomic base changes but provide transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq), as well as a high-throughput analysis of DNA-protein interactions (ChIP-seq). Utilising NGS to explore the genetic alterations occurring over the aging process within alterative cell types facilitates the comprehension of the molecular and cellular changes influencing the dynamics of aging BM. Thus, this review prospects the current landscape of BM aging and explores how NGS technology is currently being applied within this ever-expanding field of research.<sep>Critical-size long bone defects represent one of the major causes of fracture non-union and remain a significant challenge in orthopaedic surgery. Two-stage procedures such as a Masquelet technique demonstrate high level of success however their main disadvantage is the need for a second surgery, which is required to remove the non-resorbable cement spacer and to place the bone graft into the biological chamber formed by the 'induced membrane'. Recent research efforts have therefore been dedicated towards the design, fabrication and testing of resorbable implants that could mimic the biological functions of the cement spacer and the induced membrane. Amongst the various manufacturing techniques used to fabricate these implants, three-dimensional (3D) printing and electrospinning methods have gained a significant momentum due their high-level controllability, scalable processing and relatively low cost. This review aims to present recent advances in the evaluation of electrospun and 3D printed polymeric materials for critical-size, long bone defect reconstruction, emphasizing both their beneficial properties and current limitations. Furthermore, we present and discuss current state-of-the art techniques required for characterisation of the materials' physical, mechanical and biological characteristics. These represent the essential first steps towards the development of personalised implants for single-surgery, large defect reconstruction in weight-bearing bones.<sep>The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) is a crucial signaling pathway closely involved in several physiological and cellular functions, including cell cycle, apoptosis, gene expression, and responses to stress stimuli. It also plays a central role in inflammation and immunity. Owing to disparate p38-MAPK functions, it has thus far formed an elusive drug target with failed clinical trials in inflammatory diseases due to challenges including hepatotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, lack of efficacy, and tachyphylaxis, which is a brief initial improvement with rapid disease rebound. To overcome these limitations, downstream antagonism of the p38 pathway with a MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK, also known as MK2) blockade has demonstrated the potential to abrogate inflammation without the prior recognized toxicities. Such MK2 inhibition (MK2i) is associated with robust suppression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα and IL-6 and others in experimental systems and in vitro. Considering this recent evidence regarding MK2i in inflammatory arthritis, we revisit the p38-MAPK pathway and discuss the literature encompassing the challenges of p38 inhibitors with a focus on this pathway. We then highlight how novel MK2i strategies, although encouraging in the pre-clinical arena, may either show evidence for efficacy or the lack of efficacy in emergent human trials data from different disease settings.<sep>Challenges to the musculoskeletal system negatively impact the quality of life of people suffering from them, leading to pain, a decline in mobility, genetic alterations, and potential disorders. The bone marrow (BM) forms an integral part of the musculoskeletal system responsible for erythropoiesis and optimal survival of the various immune and stem cells within the BM. However, due to its dynamic and complex three-dimensional (3D) structure, replicating the BM physiologically in traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture settings is often challenging, giving rise to the need for 3D in vitro models to better dissect the BM and its regeneration. Several researchers globally have been investigating various approaches to define an appropriate 3D model for their research. Organoids are novel preclinical models that provide a 3D platform for several tissues and have been analysed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify new molecular pathways at the genetic level. The 3D in vitro models and organoids are increasingly considered important platforms for precision medicine. This review outlines the current knowledge of organoid and 3D in vitro models for the BM. We also discuss different types of 3D models which may be more adaptable for the BM. Finally, we critically review the NGS techniques used for such models and the future combination of these techniques.<sep>Aging and age-related changes impact the quality of life (QOL) in elderly with a decline in movement, cognitive abilities and increased vulnerability towards age-related diseases (ARDs). One of the key contributing factors is cellular senescence, which is triggered majorly by DNA damage response (DDR). Accumulated senescent cells (SCs) release senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which includes pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), lipids and chemokines that are detrimental to the surrounding tissues. Chronic low-grade inflammation in the elderly or inflammaging is also associated with cellular senescence and contributes to ARDs. The literature from the last decade has recorded the use of platelet rich plasma (PRP) to combat senescence and inflammation, alleviate pain as an analgesic, promote tissue regeneration and repair via angiogenesis—all of which are essential in anti-aging and tissue regeneration strategies. In the last few decades, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used as an anti-aging treatment option for dermatological applications and with great interest in tissue regeneration for orthopaedic applications, especially in osteoarthritis (OA). In this exploration, we connect the intricate relationship between aging, ARDs, senescence and inflammation and delve into PRP’s properties and potential benefits. We conduct a comparative review of the current literature on PRP treatment strategies, paying particular attention to the instances strongly linked to ARDs. Finally, upon careful consideration of this interconnected information in the context of aging, we suggest a prospective role for PRP in developing anti-aging therapeutic strategies.<sep>The reconstruction of large bone defects requires the use of biocompatible osteoconductive scaffolds. These scaffolds are often loaded with the patient's own bone marrow (BM) cells to facilitate osteoinductivity and biological potency. Scaffolds that are naturally sourced and fabricated through biomorphic transitions of rattan wood (B-HA scaffolds) offer a unique advantage of higher mechanical strength and bioactivity. In this study, we investigated the ability of a biomorphic B-HA scaffold (B-HA) to support the attachment, survival and gene expression profile of human uncultured BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs, n = 6) and culture expanded MSCs (cMSCs, n = 7) in comparison to a sintered, porous HA scaffold (S-HA). B-HA scaffolds supported BMSC attachment (average 98%) and their survival up to 4 weeks in culture. Flow cytometry confirmed the phenotype of cMSCs on the scaffolds. Gene expression indicated clear segregation between cMSCs and BMSCs with MSC osteogenesis- and adipogenesis-related genes including RUNX2, PPARγ, ALP and FABP4 being higher expressed in BMSCs. These data indicated a unique transcriptional signature of BMSCs that was distinct from that of cMSCs regardless of the type of scaffold or time in culture. There was no statistical difference in the expression of osteogenic genes in BMSCs or cMSCs in B-HA compared to S-HA. VEGF release from cMSCs co-cultured with human endothelial cells (n = 4) on B-HA scaffolds suggested significantly higher supernatant concentration with endothelial cells on day 14. This indicated a potential mechanism for providing vasculature to the repair area when such scaffolds are used for treating large bone defects.<sep>Background: The biological mechanisms that contribute to atrophic long bone non-union are poorly understood. Multipotential mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are key contributors to bone formation and are recognised as important mediators of blood vessel formation. This study examines the role of MSCs in tissue formation at the site of atrophic non-union. Materials and Methods: Tissue and MSCs from non-union sites (n = 20) and induced periosteal (IP) membrane formed following the Masquelet bone reconstruction technique (n = 15) or bone marrow (n = 8) were compared. MSC content, differentiation, and influence on angiogenesis were measured in vitro. Cell content and vasculature measurements were performed by flow cytometry and histology, and gene expression was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results: MSCs from non-union sites had comparable differentiation potential to bone marrow MSCs. Compared with induced periosteum, non-union tissue contained similar proportion of colony-forming cells, but a greater proportion of pericytes (p = 0.036), and endothelial cells (p = 0.016) and blood vessels were more numerous (p = 0.001) with smaller luminal diameter (p = 0.046). MSCs showed marked differences in angiogenic transcripts depending on the source, and those from induced periosteum, but not non-union tissue, inhibited early stages of in vitro angiogenesis. Conclusions: In vitro, non-union site derived MSCs have no impairment of differentiation capacity, but they differ from IP-derived MSCs in mediating angiogenesis. Local MSCs may thus be strongly implicated in the formation of the immature vascular network at the non-union site. Attention should be given to their angiogenic support profile when selecting MSCs for regenerative therapy.<sep>The biological waste collected during use of the Reamer/Irrigator/Aspirator (RIA; DePuy Synthes) has been described as an abundant source of bone progenitor cells with a comparable osteogenic gene profile to donor-matched iliac crest bone marrow (IC-BM). However, it is not clear whether these RIA-waste (RIA-W) cells are biologically fit. We aimed to evaluate the stress levels and functions of RIA-W progenitor cells.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were tested in freshly collected bone progenitor cells (defined as CD45CD271 cells) using flow cytometry. ROS levels induced in these cells by hypoxia and/or oxidative stress as well as by an experimental simulation of the RIA procedure were also measured. Furthermore, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression levels, proliferation, and senescence of culture-expanded RIA-W and IC-BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were compared.RIA-W and donor-matched IC-BM CD45CD271 cells were 97% and 98% viable, but the ROS levels were significantly higher for RIA-W cells than for IC-BM cells (p = 0.0020). Also, ROS induced by hypoxia, oxidative stress, and both were higher for RIA-W cells (p = 0.0312, 0.0156, and 0.0703, respectively). Dilution with saline solution, suction pressure, and irrigation reduced cell viability, with a positive correlation with the ROS level (p = 0.0035). The RIA-W and IC-BM colony-forming cells (average, 96,100 and 11,500, respectively) showed comparable ALP levels. Furthermore, culture-expanded RIA-W and IC-BM MSCs showed comparable ROS levels, ALP levels, susceptibility to death, and proliferation.Although freshly collected RIA-W bone progenitor cells appeared to be transiently stressed, these cells were as viable as IC-BM cells and present in greater numbers. The proliferation and osteogenesis of both cell types were comparable.The RIA waste bag contains bone progenitor cells with<sep>Bone void-filling cements are one of the preferred materials for managing irregular bone voids, particularly in the geriatric population who undergo many orthopedic surgeries. However, bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) of older-age donors often exhibit reduced osteogenic capacity. Hence, it is crucial to evaluate candidate bone substitute materials with BM-MSCs from the geriatric population to determine the true osteogenic potential, thus simulating the clinical situation. With this concept, we investigated the osteogenic potential of shell nacre cement (SNC), a bone void-filling cement based on shell nacre powder and ladder-structured siloxane methacrylate, using older donor BM-MSCs (age &gt; 55 years) and young donor BM-MSCs (age &lt; 30 years). Direct and indirect cytotoxicity studies conducted with human BM-MSCs confirmed the non-cytotoxic nature of SNC. The standard colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assay and population doubling (PD) time assays revealed a significant reduction in the proliferation potential (p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.05) in older donor BM-MSCs compared to young donor BM-MSCs. Correspondingly, older donor BM-MSCs contained higher proportions of senescent, β-galactosidase (SA-β gal)-positive cells (nearly 2-fold, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the proliferation capacity of older donor BM-MSCs, measured as the area density of CellTrackerTM green positive cells, was similar to that of young donor BM-MSCs following a 7-day culture on SNC. Furthermore, after 14 days of osteoinduction on SNC, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) showed that the amount of calcium and phosphorus deposited by young and older donor BM-MSCs on SNC was comparable. A similar trend was observed in the expression of the osteogenesis-related genes BMP2, RUNX2, ALP, COL1A1, OMD and SPARC. Overall, the results of this study indicated that SNC<sep>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating condition that significantly impacts its patients and is closely associated with advancing age and senescence. Treatment with autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a novel approach that is increasingly being researched for its effects. Subchondral bone mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are key progenitors that form bone and cartilage lineages that are affected in OA. This study investigated the changes in subchondral bone MSCs before and after combined intraosseous (IO) and intraarticular (IA) PRP infiltration. Patient bone marrow aspirates were collected from 12 patients (four male, eight female) aged 40-86 years old (median 59.5). MSCs were expanded in standard media containing human serum to passage 1 and analysed for their colony-forming potential, senescence status, and gene expression. Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) at baseline and 6 months post second infiltration were used to assess the clinical outcomes; seven patients were considered responders and five non-responders. The number of colony-forming MSCs did not increase in the post treatment group, however, they demonstrated significantly higher colony areas (14.5% higher compared to Pre) indicative of enhanced proliferative capacity, especially in older donors (28.2% higher). Senescence assays also suggest that older patients and responders had a higher resistance to senescent cell accumulation. Responder and non-responder MSCs tended to differ in the expression of genes associated with bone formation and cartilage turnover including osteoblast markers, matrix metalloproteinases, and their inhibitors. Taken together, our data show that in hip OA patients, combined IO and IA PRP infiltrations enhanced subchondral MSC proliferative and stress-resistance capacities, particularly in older patients. Future investigation of the potential anti-ageing effect of PRP infiltrations and the use<sep>Periosteum is vital for fracture healing, as a highly vascular and multipotential stromal cell- (MSC-) rich tissue. During surgical bone reconstruction, small fragments of periosteum can be \"clinically accessible,\" yet periosteum is currently not ultilised, unlike autologous bone marrow (BM) aspirate. This study is aimed at comparing human periosteum and donor-matched iliac crest BM MSC content and characterising MSCs in terms of colony formation, growth kinetics, phenotype, cell migration patterns, and trilineage differentiation capacity. \"Clinically accessible\" periosteum had an intact outer fibrous layer, containing CD271+ candidate MSCs located perivasculary; the inner cambium was rarely present. Following enzymatic release of cells, periosteum formed significantly smaller fibroblastic colonies compared to BM (6.1 mm2 vs. 15.5 mm2, n = 4, P = 0.0006). Periosteal colonies were more homogenous in size (range 2-30 mm2 vs. 2-54 mm2) and on average 2500-fold more frequent (2.0% vs. 0.0008%, n = 10, P = 0.004) relative to total viable cells. When expanded in vitro, similar growth rates up to passage 0 (P0) were seen (1.8 population doublings (PDs) per day (periosteum), 1.6 PDs per day (BM)); however, subsequently BM MSCs proliferated significantly slower by P4 (4.3 PDs per day (periosteum) vs. 9.3 PDs per day (BM), n = 9, P = 0.02). In early culture, periosteum cells were less migratory at slower speeds than BM cells. Both MSC types exhibited MSC phenotype and trilineage differentiation capacity; however, periosteum MSCs showed significantly lower (2.7-fold) adipogenic potential based on Nile red : DAPI ratios with reduced expression of adipogenesis-related transcripts PPAR-γ. Altogether, these data revealed that \"clinically accessible\" periosteal samples represent a consistently rich source of highly proliferative MSCs compared<sep>Uncultured mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are increasingly used in therapies; however, the effects of donor age on their biological characteristics and gene expression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate age-related changes in bone marrow (BM) MSCs following minimal or no culture manipulation. Iliac crest BM was aspirated from 67 healthy donors (19-89 years old) and directly used for the colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assay or CD45lowCD271+ cell enumeration. The colonies were analysed for colony area and integrated density (ID) when grown in standard MSC media or media supplemented with human serum from young (YS) or old (OS) donors. There was a notable age-related decline in the number of MSCs per millilitre of BM aspirate revealed by the CFU-F assay (r = -0.527, p < 0.0001) or flow cytometry (r = -0.307, p = 0.0116). Compared to young donors (19-40 years old), colony IDs were significantly lower in older donors (61-89 years old), particularly for smaller-sized colonies (42% lower, p < 0.01). When cultured in media supplemented with OS, young and old donor MSCs formed colonies with lower IDs, by 21%, p < 0.0001, and 27%, p < 0.05, respectively, indicating the formation of smaller sparser colonies. No significant differences in the expression of selected adipogenic, osteogenic, stromal, and bone remodelling genes as well as CD295, CD146, CD106, and connexin 43 surface molecules were found in sorted CD45lowCD271+ MSCs from young and old donors (n = 8 donors each). Altogether, these results show similar trends for age-related decline in BM MSC numbers measured by the CFU-F assay and flow cytometry and reveal age-related effects of human serum on MSC<sep>Ageing considerably reduces the quality of life with osteoarthritis (OA) being the most common age-related degenerative disorder. Whilst majority investigations have focussed on cartilage changes in OA, damage in the bone preceding cartilage damage, is increasingly being acknowledged. Bone and cartilage arise from progenitor cells called mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) resident in the bone marrow (BM). It was hypothesised that changes in BM MSCs contribute to OA development. It was aimed to investigate changes in BM MSCs in healthy ageing and then explore if these changes were aggravated in OA using flow cytometry for the CD45lowCD271+ phenotype and gene expression. Minimally-expanded/uncultured MSCs were used to avoid effects of in vitro ageing due to culture expansion. BM aspirates from 51 healthy donors (19-89 years old) were processed for MSC quantification using colony forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assay. For OA investigations, MSCs from donors with hip OA (56-83 years old) were recruited. Gene expression of MSC multipotentiality genes, genes associated with cell senescence and type 1 interferon (IFN1) pathway genes was compared between CD45lowCD271+ MSCs and donor-matched control CD45+CD271- haematopoietic lineage cells (HLCs). MSC numbers declined with advancing age as measured by both assays but a more prominent decline was noted using CFU-F assay. Colony size and integrated density significantly reduced in old donor MSCs indicating age-related decline in MSC proliferation. When cultured in media with old donor serum, young and old donor MSCs displayed lower proliferation. IL6 expression from old donors displayed 4-fold increase in both MSCs and HLCs. IFN1 genes displayed strikingly high expression but no age-related changes in MSCs. In OA, number of genes displayed significant differences including LepR, CXCL12</abstract>", "<keyword>Vectorization (mathematics)<sep>Pipeline transport<sep>Water resources<sep>Curse of

In turn, management of these systems can be stressed during population shifts (and corresponding demand shifts), such as those seen during both discrete (e.g., hurricanes) and protracted (e.g., pandemics) events.

To maintain a minimum residual throughout the distribution network, chlorine dosage needs to be regulated by optimizing the locations of chlorine boosters and their scheduling (i.e., chlorine injection rates).

We introduce a model with strategic but capital-constrained intermediaries to show that lower capitalization or weaker capital requirements lead intermediaries to demand more of the asset at higher prices because it becomes cheaper to do so. This increases the asset's price via market clearing. We test these predictions with data on Canadian Treasury auctions, where we can link asset demand to balance sheet information of individual intermediaries.

We document how the liquidity crisis in March 2020 affected the Israeli government bond market, and conduct difference-in-differences analyses, comparing bid-ask spreads in exchange markets (such as the Israeli government bond and U.S. future market) with markets lacking an exchange (like the U.S. government bond market). Our findings support the idea that having an exchange enhances market liquidity. A counterfactual analysis using trade data from the Israeli exchange suggests that this is due to the ability of investors to readily provide liquidity to one another and the efficient netting of trade flows on an exchange.<sep>The main objectives of debt management are to raise stable and low-cost funding to meet the government’s financial needs and to maintain a well-functioning market for government securities. A challenge is determining how to sell government debt: the sale format, the choice of securities to offer and the allocation across different maturities. This paper focuses on the allocation of debt across maturities. We propose a method for identifying dependencies in the demand for securities of different maturities. We also present a dealer-client model that captures the interplay between the primary and secondary markets. This interplay rationalizes our empirical results: that the demand of dealers across maturities at auction is complementary. Our results point to the important role that primary dealers play in making markets and highlight how this shows up in demand in primary markets. Given that different clients demand securities of different maturities (preferred habitat), primary dealers satisfy this demand largely by bidding at auction in fixed proportions. Debt managers, therefore, need to ensure that they issue enough volume across maturities to satisfy the varied demand.</abstract>", "<keyword>Systemic risk<sep>Sovereign default<sep>Credit risk<sep>Instability<sep>Portfolio<sep>Vulnerability (computing)<sep>Financial market<sep>Stress test<sep>Asset (computer security)<sep>Financial stability<sep>Stress testing (software)<sep>Financial contagion<sep>Forbearance<sep>Capital requirement<sep>Bond</keyword><title>Systemic stress test model for shared portfolio networks<sep>Systemic Stress Test Model in Shared Portfolio Networks<sep>Market Instability from Option Flows<sep>Interdependence, Vulnerability and Contagion in Financial and Economic Networks<sep>From stress testing to systemic stress testing: The importance of macroprudential regulation</title><abstract>We propose a dynamic model for systemic risk using a bipartite network of banks and assets in which the weight of links and node attributes vary over time. Using market data and bank asset holdings, we are able to estimate a single parameter as an indicator of the stability of the financial system. We apply the model to the European sovereign debt crisis and observe that the results closely match real-world events (e.g., the high risk of Greek sovereign bonds and the distress of Greek banks). Our model could become complementary to existing stress tests, incorporating the contribution of interconnectivity of the banks to systemic risk in time-dependent networks.

We apply the model to the European sovereign debt crisis and observe that the results closely match real-world events (e.g., the high risk of Greek sovereign bonds and the distress of Greek banks). The model could become complementary to existing stress tests, incorporating the systemic risk contribution of banks and assets in time-dependent networks. In addition, the model provides a simple way of assessing the stability of a system by using the ratio of the log-returns of sovereign bonds and the stocks of major sovereign debt holders as a stability indicator. We also propose a systemic importance ranking, BankRank, for the financial institutions analyzed in this study to assess the contribution of individual banks to the overall systemic risk.<sep>We demonstrate that the speculative use of call options can lead to price instability in the market of the underlying asset. In our simple model, we include fully funded investors with a downward sloping demand curve for an asset and option traders who continually reinvest their gains from speculative derivative positions. Trade is facilitated by a benevolent market maker who clears the market for the underlying asset and options, staying delta-hedged in the process. The critical parameters in our model are the implied volatility for options and the number of option traders in comparison to the number of fully funded traders. We demonstrate that the market can become unstable even if the market maker uses more sophisticated volatility estimators like GARCH. Using a recently introduced stability measure, MinMaSS, we further show that a market with an initially stable setup may tip into instability as inelastic hedging flows become more relevant.<sep>Financial and economic networks are neither static nor independent of one another, but are rather quite interconnected with a high level of dependence and mutual influence. In light of global economic convergence, countries depend on one another through trade relations, foreign direct investments, flow of funds in international capital markets, bank borrowing and lending operations, or foreign exchange trading. As economic entities and financial markets become increasingly intertwined, a shock in a financial network can provoke significant cascading failures throughout the global economic system. Here we attempt to understand potential sources of future shocks and whether bubbles and systemic risk build-up in financial networks can be anticipated. We review approaches to study global financial markets and bank networks to uncover system characteristics and relationships that might increase the vulnerability of economic networks. The efficiency of regulatory responses motivated by crisis and the proper level of regulation are extremely important for a sound global economic system.<sep>Stability of the banking system and macroprudential regulation are essential for healthy economic growth. In this paper we study the European bank network and its vulnerability to stressing different bank assets. The importance of macroprudential policy is emphasized by the inherent vulnerability of the financial system, high level of leverage, interconnectivity of system's entities, similar risk exposure of financial institutions, and susceptibility for systemic crisis propagation through the system. Current stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority do not take in consideration the connectivity of the banks and the potential of one bank vulnerability spilling over to the rest of the system. We create a bipartite network with bank nodes on one hand and asset nodes on the other with weighted links between the two layers based on the level of different countries’ sovereign debt holdings by each bank. We propose a model for systemic risk propagation based on common bank exposures to specific asset classes. We introduce the similarity in asset distribution among the banks as a measure of bank closeness. We link the closeness of asset distributions to the likelihood that banks will experience a similar level and type of distress in a given adverse scenario. We analyze the dynamics of tier 1 capital ratio after stressing the bank network and find that while the system is able to withstand shocks for a wide range of parameters, we identify a critical threshold for both asset risk and bank response to a shock beyond which the system transitions from stable to unstable.</abstract>", "<keyword>Reprint<sep>State (computer science)<sep>Work (physics)<sep>Socioeconomic status<sep>Tax credit<sep>Disease<sep>Entrepreneurship<sep>Population<sep>Ecosystem<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Analytics<sep>Investment (military)<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Incentive<sep>Tax policy</keyword><title>The Impact of State-Level Research and Development Tax Credits on the Quantity and Quality of Entrepreneurship<sep>How is Covid Changing the Geography of Entrepreneurship?

While a strong empirical base links the R&amp;D tax credit to increased innovation, prior work provides no causal evidence that the credit effects the rate of formation and growth potential of new businesses. This article combines data from the Startup Cartography Project with the Panel Database on Incentives and Taxes to implement a difference-in-differences estimate of the impact of state R&amp;D tax credits on the quantity and quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship. The authors find that the R&amp;D tax credit is associated with a significant long-term impact on both. In contrast, the authors observe that state investment tax credits have no impact on the quantity of entrepreneurship and lead to a marked decline in the rate of formation of growth-oriented start-ups over time. The results indicate the potential of state R&amp;D tax credits to stimulate entrepreneurship.<sep>Leveraging data from eight U.S. states from the Startup Cartography Project, this paper provides new insight into the changing nature and geography of entrepreneurship in the wake of the COVID pandemic. Consistent with other data sources, following an initial decline, the overall level of state-level business registrations not only rebounds but increases across all eight states. We focus here on the significant heterogeneity in this dynamic pattern of new firm formation across and within states. Specifically, there are significant differences in the dynamics of new business registrants across neighborhoods in terms of race and socioeconomic status. Areas including a higher proportion of Black residents, and more specifically higher median income Black neighborhoods, are associated with higher growth in startup formation rates between 2019 and 2020. Moreover, these dynamics are reflected in the passage of the major Federal relief packages. Even though legislation such as the CARES Act did not directly support new business formation, the passage and implementation of relief packages was followed by a relative increase in start-up formation rates, particularly in neighborhoods with higher median incomes and a higher proportion of Black residents.<sep>This paper presents the Startup Cartography Project (SCP), which offers a new set of entrepreneurial ecosystem statistics for the United States from 1988 to 2016. The SCP combines state-level business registration records with a predictive analytics approach to estimate the probability of “extreme” growth (IPO or high-value acquisition) at or near the time of founding for the population of newly-registered firms.

While there is a strong empirical base linking the R&D tax credit to increased R&D expenditures and innovation, prior work has not provided causal evidence that this policy effects the rate of formation and growth potential of new businesses. This paper combines data from the US Startup Cartography Project with the Panel Database on Incentives and Taxes to implement a difference-in-differences estimate of the impact of the R&D tax credit on the quantity and quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship. Our key finding is that the R&D tax credit is associated with a significant long-term impact on both the overall quantity and quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship, with the bulk of the effect materializing more than five years after the policy is enacted. These findings stand in contrast to an analysis of the adoption of state-level investment tax credits. There, we observe no long-term impact on the quantity of entrepreneurship but a marked decline in the rate of formation of growth-oriented startups over time. Combined with other evidence regarding the efficacy of R&D tax credits in spurring innovative investment, our results shed light on the potential for this fiscal policy to also stimulate the formation of growth-oriented start-ups.<sep>The acceleration of start-up activity is often cited as a rationale for the R&D tax credit, a key innovation policy instrument adopted increasingly by US states over the past quarter century.

The analysis estimates capital adjustment costs and uncovers capital distortion in state and non-state firms. There is strong evidence of quadratic adjustment cost and distortion in capital price for both types of firms. The capital distortion is a major source of capital misallocation in Chinese firms. Completely removing the distortion would increase aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) by 18–29%.<sep>This paper investigates the impact of volatility in profitability shock and capital adjustment cost on aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) in Chinese industries firms. To quantify the effects of volatility and adjustment costs on aggregate TFP, we recover key structural parameters in a dynamic optimization problem, so the model is able to replicate salient features observed from the firm-level data. Our result shows that volatility leads to considerable loss in aggregate TFP, while the role of adjustment cost is limited but significant.<sep>Abstract This paper investigates the impact of volatility in profitability shock, capital price distortion and adjustment costs on capital misallocation among Chinese industrial firms. We estimate a dynamic model pertaining firms' investment decision, incorporating institutional differences between state and private firms, so the model can reproduce salient features observed from Chinese firms. Our analysis shows: (i) capital price distortion is more severe among state firms than private ones; (ii) adjusting capital is more costly for state than private firms; (iii) volatility in profitability shock is a major source that causes capital misallocation for both types of firms.<sep>The paper develops and implements a methodology for assessing the role of energy prices and new investment in reducing energy intensity in Chinese industry. Analysing a unique panel data set which reports firm‐level energy consumption and price from 1997 to 2004, the paper finds: the energy prices, not only the current but also the past energy prices, are key factors that driving down firms' energy intensity for all three types of firms: state‐owned enterprises (SOEs), domestic non‐SOEs (NSOEs) and foreign‐funded firms (FFEs); furthermore, SOEs exhibit a robust price‐investment channel: responding to rising energy prices, SOEs tend to invest in new energy‐efficient capital, through which SOEs reduce energy intensity; the same price‐investment channels are less robust for non‐SOEs or foreign‐funded firms.<sep>In this paper, we argue that the widely used concept of the value-added driven ‘smile curve’ in the international business literature, which often illustrates a zero-sum game between interdependent nations in the global supply chain, requires revisiting. In particular, the U-shaped smile curve for the distribution of profitability among partners can be inverted if firms from the developing economies manage to obtain high productivity from their workers and have no high entry costs to the midstream industries that specialize in global supply chains. We construct an economic model and find that the theories proposed in the paper are broadly consistent with the empirical evidence. Our findings have some important implications for the current debate on industrialization strategies with particular reference to outsourcing industrialization for developing countries.<sep>This paper employs a structural econometric approach to study the joint dynamic demand for capital and labor in Chinese firms. We recover key structural parameters in a dynamic model of interrelated factor demand subject to joint convex and non-convex costs. The model is able to replicate the stylized facts directly observed from Chinese manufacturing firm-level data over the period 1998–2007. Our estimations reveal that firms exhibit significant convex and fixed costs when adjusting capital or employment stock. Moreover, the adjustments in two factor inputs are inter-related, and adjusting capital and labor simultaneously is more costly than adjusting two inputs sequentially. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that removing the frictions in both capital and labor adjustments will lead to a 1% increase in aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) and a 7% increase in aggregate output.<sep>By incorporating energy-saving through both technology-embodied investment and embodied investment-specific technical change, as well as disembodied factor-neutral technical change into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with heterogeneous investment, this paper deepens our understanding of the avenues through which firms adjust to rising energy prices. Using Chinese firm-level data from 1997-2004, we estimate a set of stylized facts regarding how firms of various ownership types respond to energy price changes. Through indirect inference, we then use these stylized facts to recover the key parameters in the DSGE model. The results show that within Chinese industry, in response to rising energy prices, state-owned enterprises, domestic non-state enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises employ significantly different means to achieve their energy efficiency. Such differences can be substantially explained by government policy affecting energy pricing and the cost of investment finance across firms of different ownership types.<sep>As the conventional method for estimating the impact of energy prices on energy consumption, the reduced form approach creates a “black box” interpretation of the energy price-intensity relationship without identifying the channels, or their magnitudes, through which prices matter. This shortcoming is particularly serious for China that has multiple ownership types operating under different government policy regimes. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper formulates a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that incorporates a range of technology avenues – both embodied and disembodied – for achieving energy-savings in response to rising energy prices. Employing Chinese firm-level data, the paper recovers key parameters in the DSGE model by indirect inference; so the model can replicate the stylized facts based on the firm-level data. A key finding is that embodied putty-clay investment is a critical channel for achieving energy efficiency, on which SOEs most depend, non-state-owned enterprises depend less, and foreign-funded enterprises least depend.<sep>This paper investigates the effect of state-owned enterprises reform, a policy phrased as “grasping the large, letting the small go”, on firms’ capital efficiency in Chinese industries from 1998–2007. First, we present several stylized facts on investment rates in state and private firms. Second, a dynamic programming problem is proposed and key structural parameters are recovered through simulated moment matching method, so the estimated dynamic model is able to replicate the stylized facts that are directly observable from the firm-level data. Our quantitative analysis shows that the conversion of state firms into private ones reduces capital adjustment costs. Particularly, state firms’ quadratic adjustment cost declines significantly almost by half, and the fixed cost decreases slightly. These findings are robust in various specifications. Hence, the reform in state firms leads to increased capital efficiency. Last, the counterfactual analysis suggests that state and private firm’s output would increase about 9.60% and 1.87% if the capital adjustment costs in state firms were lowered to the same levels in private firms.<sep>Previous research has highlighted the significant impact of geographical proximity in stimulating collaboration networks. Nevertheless, this view is challenged by the tremendous growth of cross-regional academia-industry collaborations. In this paper, we analyzed the cross-regional collaboration network established between the research institutes affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and firms, and examined the impact of geographical proximity and economic proximity on cross-regional academia-industry collaboration by using the Exponential Random Graph models. Given the different levels of regional economic development, the study indicates that geographical proximity has a negative impact on cross-regional academia-industry collaboration with a decreasing trend. By contrast, economic proximity has varying impacts on cross-regional academia-industry collaboration. Specifically, for research institutes in developed regions, economic proximity has a positive effect on cross-regional academia-industry collaboration, while less-developed regions experience negative effects. This suggests that the knowledge spillovers from research institutes tend to flow to firms in developed regions. This study holds significant policy implications, indicating the necessity for governments to develop distinct regional innovation policies to encourage cooperation between industries and academia.</abstract>", "<keyword>Safety net<sep>Financial market<sep>China<sep>Global governance<sep>Geography of finance<sep>East Asia<sep>Footprint<sep>Balance of payments<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>Currency<sep>Scale (ratio)<sep>Politics<sep>Conditionality<sep>Architecture<sep>Debt<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Developing country<sep>Currency crisis<sep>Austerity<sep>Financial crisis<sep>Sovereign wealth fund<sep>Latin Americans<sep>Creditor<sep>Delegation<sep>International finance<sep>Liberian dollar<sep>Corporate governance<sep>Restructuring<sep>Project finance<sep>Delegate<sep>Institutional analysis<sep>Market liquidity<sep>Swap (finance)<sep>Capital (architecture)<sep>Chiang mai</keyword><title>Geolocated dataset of Chinese overseas development finance<sep>How has ASEAN+3 financial cooperation affected global financial governance?<sep>Alternatives to the International Monetary Fund in Asia and Latin America: Lessons for Regional Financial Arrangements<sep>Whatever it takes?

The resulting dataset enables economic, environmental, and social analyses with high-precision spatial accuracy, as well as spatiotemporal monitoring by project stakeholders and enhanced planning by project managers.

However, despite the region’s increased voice in governance and economic weight, East Asian financial systems and markets have mostly adapted to global norms developed in New York, London, and Washington, DC. We argue that the failure of East Asia to push an alternative vision of financial governance reflects both the lack of regional political unity and, more crucially, the divisions of interests both between and within key East Asian economies. Despite nearly universal regional dissatisfaction with global standards and institutions in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis, these two factors have combined to prevent the development of a distinctive regional model that could be promoted at the global level.<sep>This chapter presents a comparative analysis of the background, governance and economic impacts of two existing short-term liquidity mechanisms, the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) and the Latin American Reserve Fund (referred to by its better-known Spanish acronym, FLAR—Fondo Latinoamericano de Reservas). We find that the structures of regional financial institutions as well as the amount of resources available to member countries are contingent on regional dynamics, the economic characteristics of members and members’ reluctance to approach the IMF for short-term balance-of-payments support. This study offers an up-to-date assessment of the two RFAs, based primarily on on-site interviews with their respective staff members, regional government and central bank officials, and scholars. Those interviews, conducted in 2016, revealed how, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, RFAs advanced efforts to improve their internal research capacity, develop strategic alliances and increase the resources available to their members.<sep>Multilateral financial institutions have pledged to do whatever it takes to enable emerging market and developing countries to fill a $2.5 trillion financing gap to combat Covid-19 and subsequent economic crises. In this article, we present new datasets to track the extent to which multilateral financial institutions are meeting these goals, and conduct a preliminary assessment of progress to date. We find that the International Monetary Fund and the principal regional financial arrangements have made relatively trivial amounts of new financing available and have been slow to disburse the financing at their disposal. As of July 31, 2020, these institutions had committed $89.56 billion in loans and $550 million in currency swaps, totaling $90.11 billion—just 12.6% of their current capacity. The new datasets allow scholars, policymakers, and civil society to continue to track these trends, and eventually examine the impact of such financing on health and development outcomes.<sep>Abstract Since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, East Asia has gone from having virtually no regional financial cooperation to having multiple cooperative arrangements. This article focuses on the issue area of emergency liquidity provision, where global (International Monetary Fund), regional (Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization), and bilateral arrangements co-exist and overlap in complicated ways, forming a regime complex. While the overall system offers more options and greater funding than were available in 1997, it also raises questions about how those levels will operate in a crisis. This article shows how national preferences of likely creditor and likely borrower countries have interacted to create the current regime complex, as well as the political compromises and remaining uncertainties about how they will work together. It argues that the evolution and current shape of the regime complex have been driven by the efforts of key states to take advantage of or thwart power asymmetries.<sep>Abstract Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, East Asia’s ASEAN +3 states have built the second-largest regional emergency liquidity fund in the world, the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization ( CMIM ). With a total commitment of $ 240 billion to aid member states facing a currency crisis, CMIM can provide more funds to members than the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ). Nonetheless, CMIM continues to be functionally subordinate to IMF decisions. This may now be changing following the 2011 creation of the ASEAN +3 Macroeconomic Research Office ( AMRO ) as a regional mechanism to manage surveillance and design of CMIM lending programs. The ability to delegate surveillance and program design to an independent body is a crucial prerequisite to ending CMIM ’s subordination to the IMF , and AMRO seeks to ensure such autonomy through its institutional design. This article analyzes AMRO ’s progress toward autonomy, using indicators of effective delegation drawn from organizational theory and newly available information and data on AMRO .<sep>ABSTRACT The 21st century has ushered in the emergence of alternative institutions for liquidity provision and development finance, many of which are Southern‐led. The special issue that follows this Introduction assesses the extent to which existing theoretical perspectives and tools are sufficient for evaluating the implications of these alternatives for the global financial architecture. Our analysis finds that while an increasingly varied landscape of diverse institutions designed to foster financial stability and development comes with inherent risks, these new forms of finance bring real benefits to an architecture that has long been deemed insufficient. Larger and more capable Southern‐led institutions not only mean additional sources of financing for emerging market and developing countries, but also could increase their voice in an international financial architecture long dominated by the most advanced economies. That said, the variation in the landscape could create inequities and fault lines between new and existing institutions, which will be difficult to overcome through the coordination of a fragmented and diverse system. Finally, despite the increases in capital for liquidity provision and development made available by these new institutions, significantly more financing and coordination will be needed to achieve financial stability and economic development on a global scale.<sep>Abstract In 2009, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reformed its lending arrangements and conditionality. Thereafter, it has pursued “parsimony,” emphasizing headline fiscal adjustments rather than detailed budgetary changes. This paper analyzes the extent to which these reforms have resulted in changes to the overall austerity required by IMF agreements. We create a new variable measuring the level of fiscal consolidation required in each IMF program from 2001 through 2021 the IMF Fiscal Adjustment Indicator (IMF FAI). We explore whether IMF austerity eased after the financial crisis and the later COVID-19 pandemic. We also estimate the economic and political determinants that help explain varying levels of IMF austerity across IMF programs during this period. We find that IMF conditions were less austere for the years of 2009 and 2020, but quickly returned to their previous levels, echoing the IMF’s advice to “keep the receipts” during crises. However, these temporary relaxations were not statistically significant, pointing to overarching continuity. We find that countries that were granted relatively more lenient conditionality were found to be those with closer relations with major shareholders of the IMF: Western Europe and the United States. In contrast, countries with close diplomatic relations with China face higher IMF austerity.<sep>ABSTRACT This article examines the impact of regional financial arrangements (RFAs) on the global liquidity regime. It argues that the design of RFAs could potentially alter the global regime, whether by strengthening it and making it more coherent or by decentring the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and destabilizing it. To determine possible outcomes, this analysis deploys a ‘middle‐up’ approach that focuses on the institutional design of these RFAs. It first draws on the rational design of institutions framework to identify the internal characteristics of RFAs that are most relevant to their capabilities and capacities. It then applies these insights to the interactions of RFAs with the IMF, building on Aggarwal's (1998) concept of ‘nested’ versus ‘parallel’ institutions, to create an analytical lens through which to assess the nature and sustainability of nested linkages. Through an analysis of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) and the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR), the article demonstrates the usefulness of this lens. It concludes by considering three circumstances in which fault lines created by these RFAs’ institutional design could be activated, permitting an institution to ‘leave the nest’, including changing intentions of principals, creation of parallel capabilities and facilities, and failure of the global regime to address regional needs in a crisis.<sep>As the world comes to grips with the devastating economic and public health consequences of the COVID-19 Coronavirus, Southern-led alternative institutions for finance and development seem more important than ever. This volume charts the dramatic change in the global financial and monetary landscape that has unfolded over the last few decades, in particular, through the expansion of Southern-led and Southern-oriented institutions and mechanisms. The change is profound, and it has moreover not stopped; the evolution of the Southern-led financial architecture is likely to continue, as the South not only adapts to changing global economic conditions, but changes them—increasing its role in global economic governance. This book takes stock of some of the most interesting adaptations and institutions led by the South with respect to short-term foreign liquidity and emergency finance. It focuses on common currency areas and payment systems designed to avoid exposure to volatile international currencies and to promote a more resilient pattern of interregional trade; the potential for the newly emergent Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) to play a more developmental role; and, the better known short-term liquidity mechanisms that pool foreign exchange reserves or serve as multilateralized swap arrangements that can provide countercyclical finance or liquidity to member countries, oftentimes more quickly and more generously than the International Monetary Fund (IMF).<sep>Abstract The global financial safety net (GFSN) has become increasingly voluminous and complex. The ever-increasing capacity for crisis prevention and liquidity support of emergency financing institutions and arrangements at the bilateral, regional, and global level sums up to a total lending capacity of at least US$ 3.5 trillion (Mühlich, L., B. Fritz, W. N. Kring, and K. P. Gallagher. 2020. The Global Financial Safety Net Tracker: Lessons for the COVID-19 Crisis from a New Interactive Dataset . GEGI Policy Brief 10. Boston: Global Development Policy Center. Also available at: www.bu.edu/gdp/files/2020/04/GEGI-GDP_PolicyBrief_FInal.pdf ). This represents a more than tenfold increase to available short-term liquidity compared to before the global financial crisis of 2008/09. Yet despite this tremendous increase in resources, the GFSN remains scarcely utilized throughout the COVID-19 crisis. This article develops a framework, that builds upon concepts in economics and international political economy, to analyze GFSN inefficiencies and to evaluate the utilization of the GFSN. Combining balance of payments models with the concept of regime complexity, we analyze and compare patterns of GFSN utilization in response to COVID-19 with past usage. We ask if the current GFSN is adequately built to efficiently respond to such a crisis. We are especially interested in examining the role that the six existing RFAs between EMDEs play in the GFSN.<sep>Abstract We call for strengthening the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN) to manage the economic effects of COVID‐19, in particular the massive capital outflows from emerging market and developing economies EMDEs and the global shortage of dollar liquidity. Both the United Nations (UN) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that EMDEs need an immediate $2.5 trillion, yet the financing available to them is just $700 to $971 billion. To meet these immediate needs we propose to: (1) broaden the coverage of the Federal Reserve currency swaps; (2) issue at least $500 billion of special drawing rights through the IMF; (3) improve the IMF’s precautionary and emergency facilities; (4) establish a multilateral swap facility at the IMF; (5) increase the resources and geographic coverage of regional financial arrangements; (6) coordinate capital flow management measures; (7) initiate debt restructuring and relief initiatives; and (8) request that credit‐rating agencies stop making downgrades during the emergency. It argues that leaders should swiftly move to address these structural gaps in the GFSN: (1) agree on a quota reform at the IMF; (2) create an appropriate sovereign debt restructuring regime; (3) expand surveillance activity; and (4) adopt IMF governance reform and strengthen its relations with all agents of the GFSN. All of these reforms must be calibrated toward a just transition to a more stable, inclusive, and sustainable global economy.</abstract>", "<keyword>Tick<sep>Dynamics (music)<sep>Procurement<sep>The Internet<sep>Common value auction<sep>Stock market<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Point (geometry)<sep>Order (exchange)<sep>Market liquidity<sep>Term (time)<sep>Stock (firearms)<sep>Competition (biology)<sep>Tick size<sep>Broadband</keyword><title>New Technology and Business Dynamics<sep>Broadband Internet and the Stock Market Investments of Individual Investors<sep>Tick Size Wars: The Market Quality Effects of Pricing Grid Competition<sep>Do Temporary Demand Shocks Have Long-Term Effects for Startups?</title><abstract>We examine business dynamics following a natural experiment: The staggered roll-out of a new technology, broadband internet, throughout Norway. The new technology led to a large, 20% increase in startup rates. Quality measures for these startups did not decline. In contrast, we do not find effects on the employment or assets of established firms. Applications to literatures on business dynamics, entrepreneurship, and technology adoption are discussed. Overall, our findings support ideas from Schumpeter (1934) and Arrow (1962) that startups play an important role in adapting the economy to new technology.<sep>We study the effects of broadband internet use on the investment decisions of individual investors. A public program in Norway provides plausibly exogenous variation in internet use. Our instrumental variables estimates show that internet use causes a substantial increase in stock market participation, driven primarily by increased fund ownership. Existing investors tilt their portfolios towards funds, thereby obtaining more diversified portfolios and higher Sharpe ratios, and do not increase their trading activity in stocks. Overall, access to high-speed internet seems to spur a 'democratization of finance', with individuals making investment decisions that are more in line with the advice from portfolio theory.<sep>Abstract We explore the effects of a “tick size war” in which European trading venues directly competed on the minimum pricing increment in the limit order book, the tick size. We find that venues that reduced their tick size immediately captured market shares of both quoted and executed volume from the exchanges that kept their ticks large. We find that tick size competition improves market quality, reducing trading costs, and increasing market-wide depth and volume. These market quality improvements are strongest in stocks where the bid–ask spread was constrained to one tick, where liquidity providers use the finer pricing grid to engage in price competition.<sep>Abstract Using procurement auctions and register data, we find that temporary demand shocks have long-term effects for startups. Startups that win a procurement auction have 20$\\%$ higher sales and employment and are more profitable than startups that narrowly lose an auction, even several years after the contract work has ended. There are no such effects for mature firms. The effects for startups are large: about 50$\\%$ of the contract value is transmitted into long-term sales. Our analysis suggests learning-by-doing as a plausible mechanism. Overall, our results point to the importance of path dependence in shaping the long-term outcomes of startups.

This finding is robust to various specifications, including a difference-in-difference approach based on CEO turnovers. Able managers' preferences for short-term debt are amplified for firms with greater growth opportunities and are attenuated by firms' refinancing risk. Additional analyses shed light on the implications of high-ability managers' strategic use of short-term debt. Overall, the results presented in this study demonstrate that managers' innate ability plays a critical role in shaping corporate debt maturity structure.<sep>Abstract We find a positive association between institutional ownership and social capital. The social norms in a region, while not imposed by businesses or laws, play a monitoring role that disciplines managers from self‐serving behaviors. The resulting trustworthiness, through its mitigation of agency problems, drives the investment preferences of institutions. Our subsample analyses based on information asymmetry and financial performance support this inference. Further, the positive association is evident for transient investors and quasi‐indexers but not for dedicated institutional investors. Overall, our study underscores the impact of informal governance on institutions' investment decisions.<sep>We show that social capital has a strong mitigating effect on financial adviser misconduct in the United States. Moreover, advisers who have committed misconduct are also more likely to relocate to counties with a relatively lower level of social capital than that of his previously residing county. These findings provide support for both the deterrence and displacement effects of social capital on financial adviser misconduct, and are robust to tests that address potential endogeneity concerns. Our results shed new light on social capital as an informal governing and monitoring mechanism against individual unethical behavior.<sep>We investigate the relation between firms' business seasonality and their stock market liquidity and find robust evidence that firms with seasonal business tend to have less liquid equity. The effect of seasonality on stock liquidity is amplified for firms facing greater information asymmetry. Furthermore, firms with seasonal business patterns are associated with a higher probability of informed trading, and their stock returns co-move less with the market. Overall, our results suggest that the business patterns of such firms may negatively affect their information environments, and investors’ concerns with regard to adverse selection impede the liquidity provision for these firms.<sep>Abstract Well‐known anomalies and stable patterns in equity returns are widely employed to guide stock selection. The use of overlapping multifactor models built on these patterns induces correlated trade across investors. A stock with a strong signal from a parsimonious multifactor stock selection model exhibits changes in trade activity, net order imbalances, lower volatility, lower liquidity level, and changes in liquidity comovement consistent with correlated trade. These results illustrate that correlated trading among investors can affect the liquidity and risk of the securities they trade, and imply that measures of portfolio liquidity risk that ignore these changes can understate risk.<sep>We examine the relevance of informal contracting mechanisms for corporate innovation. Using social capital to capture the social costs imposed on opportunistic behavior by management, we report evidence that firms headquartered in states with higher levels of social capital are associated with more innovation. This result is more pronounced when employees are more susceptible to holdup (e.g., firms with low labor union coverage, firms located in states with weak legal protections for employees, and firms surrounded by few external employment opportunities) and when employees face higher levels of information asymmetry. Our study highlights the importance of informal contracts for innovation.<sep>We find that both firm leverage and short-term debt ratios are negatively associated with social capital (i.e., the altruistic tendency and mutual trust among people within a community). This relation is more pronounced in cases where information asymmetry problems are more severe and is robust to using alternative measures of key variables, addressing endogeneity issues, employing alternative model specifications, and simultaneously estimating leverage and short-term debt. An analysis on debt structure (bank loans vs. public debt) shows consistent results. Our findings are in line with the idea that social capital lowers the need for corporate borrowing mechanisms as a means to alleviate agency problems for firms.<sep>This study documents that firms with higher stock liquidity are more willing to extend trade credit and are less reliant on trade credit financing. This finding is robust to a battery of control variables, alternative measures of stock liquidity, different fixed effects, an instrumental variable approach, and a difference-in-difference approach using tick-size change as a quasi-natural experiment that exogenously increases stock liquidity. Subsample analyses show that the relation between trade credit policies and stock liquidity is more pronounced for firms that are financially constrained, dependent on external financing, and restricted by short-term debt. Overall, the evidence presented in this paper indicates that access to the equity market has important implications on firms' trade credit policies.<sep>Abstract Suppliers that are farther away from their customers make more relationship‐specific investments (RSI). This association is more pronounced when it is less costly for the customer to switch to alternative suppliers and when the supplier operates in relatively opaque information environments. Using the introduction of new airline routes as an exogenous shock to the distance between supply chain partners, we show that the relation between supplier RSI and distance may be causal. We also provide evidence that suppliers with larger RSI are better able to maintain long‐distance business relationships and are associated with higher firm value. These findings suggest an important dimension of supplier commitment: Suppliers use RSI as a signal of their willingness to fulfill on‐going implicit claims.<sep>We show an inverse relation between the use of short-term debt and stock market liquidity. This finding is robust to a battery of control variables, alternative measures of the key variables, and various identification strategies. A difference-in-difference (DiD) approach suggests that the relation between debt maturity structure and stock liquidity may be causal. The impact of stock liquidity on debt maturity is stronger in the presence of large institutional holdings and when borrowers are subject to greater refinancing risk. We also provide evidence that firms with liquid stock tend to issue longer-term bonds and enjoy lower bond yield spreads. Overall, our results support the view that the governance function of stock market liquidity reduces the necessity of debt market monitoring, which allows firms to shift toward longer-term debt to avoid the costs and risk of frequent refinancing.<sep>The objective of this study was to determine the different effects of the arrow-pointing augmented reality head-up display (AR-HUD) interface, virtual shadow AR-HUD interface, and non-AR-HUD interface on autonomous vehicle takeover efficiency and driver eye movement characteristics in different driving scenarios.Thirty-six participants were selected to carry out a simulated driving experiment, and the eye movement index and takeover time were analyzed.The arrow pointing AR-HUD interface and the virtual shadow AR-HUD interface could effectively reduce the driver's visual distraction, improve the efficiency of obtaining visual information, reduce the number of times the driver's eyes leave the road, and improve the efficiency of the takeover compared with the non-AR-HUD interface, but there was no significant difference in eye movement indexes between the arrow pointing AR-HUD interface and the more eye-catching virtual shadow AR-HUD interface. When specific scenarios were considered, it was found that in the scenario of emergency braking of the vehicle in front, the arrow pointing AR-HUD interface and the virtual shadow AR-HUD interface had more advantages in takeover efficiency than the non-AR-HUD interface. However, in the scenarios of a rear vehicle overtaking the vehicle ahead and non-motor vehicles running red lights, there was no significant difference in takeover efficiency. For the non-motor vehicle invading the line, emergency U-turn of the vehicle in front, and pedestrian crossing scenarios, the virtual shadow AR-HUD interface had the highest takeover efficiency.These research results can help improve the active safety of autonomous vehicle AR-HUD interfaces.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Luteolin<sep>Internalization<sep>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy<sep>Crystal (programming language)<sep>Kaempferol<sep>In vivo<sep>Micronucleus test<sep>Receptor<sep>Allergy<sep>Lipopolysaccharide<sep>Cancer<sep>Single crystal<sep>Neuroprotection<sep>Analgesic<sep>Microbiome<sep>Drug<sep>Drug discovery<sep>Acridine orange<sep>Phytochemical<sep>Nitric oxide<sep>Agonist<sep>Lachnospiraceae<sep>Rhamnaceae<sep>Offspring<sep>Inflammation<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Genotoxicity<sep>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor<sep>Lipoxin<sep>Lung<sep>Bronchoalveolar lavage<sep>Rutin<sep>Galangin<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Ziziphus<sep>Monoclinic crystal system<sep>Gestation<sep>Population<sep>Targeted therapy<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Antioxidant<sep>Tripterygium wilfordii<sep>Odds ratio<sep>Nitric oxide synthase<sep>Viability assay<sep>Drug development<sep>Pentapeptide repeat<sep>Acute toxicity<sep>Ames test<sep>Inhalation exposure<sep>Metastatic breast cancer<sep>Glutathione<sep>Pregnancy<sep>Biocompatibility<sep>Decoction<sep>Photoconductivity<sep>CCL4<sep>Drug delivery<sep>DAPI<sep>Gefitinib<sep>Celastrol<sep>Breast cancer<sep>Trastuzumab<sep>Ovalbumin<sep>Hepatocellular carcinoma<sep>Oxidative stress<sep>Alternative medicine<sep>Asthma<sep>Bark (sound)</keyword><title>Investigations on physiochemical and third-order nonlinear optical studies on quinolinium based organic crystal<sep>Engineered nanomaterials as an effective tool for HER2+ breast cancer therapy<sep>Fabrication of chitosan-based redox-responsive polymeric nanoparticles: In-vitro and in-vivo evaluation for treating airway inflammation in asthma<sep>Mechanistic investigation of PPARγ-facilitated anti-asthmatic effects of Galangin (Norizalpinin): Insights from in silico and in vivo analyses<sep>Celastrol: A Potential Natural Lead Molecule for New Drug Design, Development and Therapy for Memory Impairment<sep>Chemistry, Biosynthesis and Pharmacology of Streptonigrin: An Old Molecule with Future Prospects for New Drug Design, Development and Therapy<sep>Intra-Airway Treatment with Synthetic Lipoxin A4 and Resolvin E2 Mitigates Neonatal Asthma Triggered by Maternal Exposure to Environmental Particles<sep>Pentapeptide cRGDfK-Surface Engineered Nanostructured Lipid Carriers as an Efficient Tool for Targeted Delivery of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor for Battling Hepatocellular Carcinoma<sep>Gut and lung microbiome profiles in pregnant mice<sep>Fabrication of marizomib-loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework-8@manganese dioxide for promising drug delivery system of glioma cancer cells<sep>Risk of asthma in offspring of asthmatic fathers versus mothers: A population-based study of 21,000 individuals in Denmark<sep>Ziziphus mauritiana Lam attenuates inflammation via downregulating NFκB pathway in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages &amp; OVA-induced airway inflammation in mice models<sep>Evaluation of analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities of Ziziphus mauritania Lam leaves in animal models<sep>Standardization, in-silico and in-vivo safety assessment of methanol extract of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam leaves<sep>HPLC-ESI-QqQ based standardization, mutagenic and genotoxic potential of methanol extract of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam leaves<sep>Myxopyrum serratulum ameliorates airway inflammation in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and OVA-induced murine model of allergic asthma<sep>Protective effect of pentandra (L) Gaertn on CCl4-induced oxidative stress and liver damage in rats</title><abstract>Newly identified organic single crystals of 8-hydroyquinolinium 2-chloro 4-nitrobenzoate (HQ2ClNB) were grown by the slow evaporation solution growth technique (SEST) using methanol as a solvent. It crystallizes in monoclinic crystal system with a space group of P21/c. Crystalline nature and phases were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The existence of various functional groups in the molecule was identified using the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. Optical transmission window and lower cut-off wavelength of the HQ2ClNB crystal have been evaluated by UV–Visible–NIR studies. Dielectric and photoconductivity studies were recorded. Third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility [Formula: see text] of the crystals were evaluated by [Formula: see text]-scan studies.<sep>Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer in women, with a high morbidity rate. The human epidermal growth factor receptor HER2 is a growth-promoting protein that is overexpressed in 15-20% of breast cancers (HER2+ BCs) and is often associated with clinically aggressive disease. Targeting this oncogene has resulted in significant improvements in survival outcomes for HER2+ BC patients. Several HER2-targeted therapies are currently available, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates. These therapeutics have improved clinical outcomes in HER2+ BC patients with metastatic disease, increasing the median overall survival (OS) rate. Despite these advancements, there are still many challenges to overcome. In recent times, there has been a significant increase in the use of engineered nanomaterials as efficient cancer therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the application of nanomaterials in HER2+ BC therapy using selected examples.<sep>The current study reveals a novel redox-responsive copolymer synthesis using chitosan and methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG), as well as the formulation of prednisone-loaded nanoparticles (P-NPs) for glutathione (GSH)-responsive release. A specific ligand for cancer-cell receptor, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), was conjugated to P-NPs (ANP-P-NPs) for target-specific drug delivery. Analyses of physiochemical characterizations were conducted. As a result, the nanoparticle sizes were less than 200 nm, entrapment efficiency was estimated to be 73.89 ± 0.45%, and the zeta potential was approximately −20 mV. In the presence of GSH, particle size analysis, and in-vitro release studies show an increase in the size and rapid release of the drug, whereas these results were negligible in the absence of GSH. Furthermore, nanoparticle biocompatibility was examined in L132 cells, anti-cancer effect and receptor-mediated internalization studies in A549 cells, and anti-inflammatory activity was observed in RAW264.7 macrophages. An in vivo anti-inflammatory test was conducted using a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation. The results indicate that the nanoparticles have better anti-inflammatory activity, suppressing pro-inflammatory mediators due to their stimuli-responsive properties. In summary, the macromolecule chitosan-based redox-responsive nanoparticles demonstrate potential as safe and efficient drug delivery vehicles.<sep>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a multifaceted ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates inflammatory responses in asthma pathophysiology. The present study corroborates PPARγ-mediated anti-asthmatic action of the flavonoid, galangin (norizalpinin). In silico molecular interactions reveal that galangin formed three H-bonds (Glu291, Leu340 and Ser342) and a π-sigma bond (Arg288) with PPARγ, contributing to the binding affinity and stability of the complex. In vivo studies explore the role of galangin as a propitious PPARγ agonist in mitigating airway inflammation, thereby excluding ligand-independent action of PPARγ. Accordingly, oral administration of galangin significantly ameliorated airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia by the suppression of IL-4, 5, 13, 17, TNF-α, NO, ROS, EPO, IgE and increase of IFN-γ in ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma model. PPARγ expression (mRNA and protein) studies were performed to elucidate a possible mechanism by which galangin modulates. Furthermore, to eliminate PPARγ-independent effects of galangin, a specific PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) was administered, which dramatically reversed the effects of galangin on PPARγ up-regulation, confirming the pleiotropic role of galangin as a PPARγ agonist in asthma therapeutics. Taken together, our findings communicate that PPARγ plays as a master regulator in the anti-asthmatic action of galangin.<sep>Celastrol is a naturally occurring chemical isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f., root extracts widely known for their neuroprotective properties. In this review, we focus on the efficacy of celastrol in mitigating memory impairment (MI) in both in vivo and in vitro models. Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science databases were utilised to locate pertinent literatures that explore the effects of celastrol in the brain, including its pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, behavioral effects and some of the putative mechanisms of action on memory in many MI models. To date, preclinical studies strongly suggest that celastrol is highly effective in enhancing the cognitive performance of MI animal models, particularly in the memory domain, including spatial, recognition, retention and reference memories, via reduction in oxidative stress and attenuation of neuro-inflammation, among others. This review also emphasised the challenges and potential associated enhancement of medication delivery for MI treatment. Additionally, the potential structural alterations and derivatives of celastrol in enhancing its physicochemical and drug-likeness qualities are examined. The current review demonstrated that celastrol can improve cognitive performance and mitigate MI in several preclinical investigations, highlighting its potential as a natural lead molecule for the design and development of a novel neuroprotective medication.<sep>Abstract: Streptonigrin is an aminoquinone alkaloid isolated from Streptomyces flocculus and is gaining attention as a drug molecule owing to its potential antitumor and antibiotic effects. It was previously used as an anticancer drug but has been discontinued because of its toxic effects. However, according to the most recent studies, the toxicity of streptonigrin and its structurally modified derivatives has been reduced while maintaining their potential pharmacological action at lower concentrations. To date, many investigations have been conducted on this molecule and its derivatives to determine the most effective molecule with low toxicity to enable new drug discovery. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive review and to discuss the prospects for streptonigrin and its derived compounds, which may boost the molecule as a highly interesting target molecule for new drug design, development and therapy. To complete this review, relevant literature was collected from several scientific databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and ScienceDirect. Following a complete screening, the obtained information is summarized in the present review to provide a good reference and accelerate the development and utilization of streptonigrin and its derivatives as pharmaceuticals. Graphical Abstract: Keywords: streptonigrin, chemistry, biosynthesis, pharmacology, anticancer, antibacterial<sep>Particulate matter in the air exacerbates airway inflammation (AI) in asthma; moreover, prenatal exposure to concentrated urban air particles (CAPs) and diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) predisposes the offspring to asthma and worsens the resolution of AI in response to allergens. We previously tested the hypothesis that such exposure impairs the pathways of specialized proresolving mediators that are critical for resolution and found declined Lipoxin A4 (LxA4) and Resolvin E2 (RvE2) levels in the \"at-risk\" pups of exposed mothers. Here, we hypothesized that supplementation with synthetic LxA4 or RvE2 via the airway can ameliorate AI after allergen exposure, which has not been tested in models with environmental toxicant triggers. BALB/c newborns with an asthma predisposition resultant from prenatal exposure to CAPs and DEPs were treated once daily for 3 days with 750 ng/mouse of LxA4 or 300 ng/mouse of RvE2 through intranasal instillation, and they were tested with the intentionally low-dose ovalbumin protocol that elicits asthma in the offspring of particle-exposed mothers but not control mothers, mimicking the enigmatic maternal transmission of asthma seen in humans. LxA4 and RvE2 ameliorated the asthma phenotype and improved AI resolution, which was seen as declining airway eosinophilia, lung tissue infiltration, and proallergic cytokine levels.<sep>Background: Antitumor research aims to efficiently target hepatocarcinoma cells (HCC) for drug delivery. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are promising for active tumour targeting. Cell-penetrating peptides are feasible ligands for targeted cancer treatment. Methods: In this study, we optimized gefitinib-loaded NLCs (GF-NLC) for HCC treatment. The NLCs contained cholesterol, oleic acid, Pluronic F-68, and Phospholipon 90G. The NLC surface was functionalized to enhance targeting with the cRGDfK-pentapeptide, which binds to the αvβ 3 integrin receptor overexpressed on hepatocarcinoma cells. Results: GF-NLC formulation was thoroughly characterized for various parameters using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analysis. In-vitro and in-vivo studies on the HepG2 cell line showed cRGDfK@GF-NLC’s superiority over GF-NLC and free gefitinib. cRGDfK@GF-NLC exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity, growth inhibition, and cellular internalization. Biodistribution studies demonstrated enhanced tumour site accumulation without organ toxicity. The findings highlight cRGDfK@GF-NLC as a highly efficient carrier for targeted drug delivery, surpassing non-functionalized NLCs. These functionalized NLCs offer promising prospects for improving hepatocarcinoma therapy outcomes by specifically targeting HCC cells. Conclusion: Based on these findings, cRGDfK@GF-NLC holds immense potential as a highly efficient carrier for targeted drug delivery of anticancer agents, surpassing the capabilities of non-functionalized NLCs. This research opens up new avenues for effective treatment strategies in hepatocarcinoma. Keywords: nanostructured lipid carrier, αvβ 3 integrin receptor, cRGDfK-pentapeptide, hepatocellular carcinoma, tumour targeting<sep>In recent years, microbiome research has expanded from the gastrointestinal tract to other host sites previously thought to be abacterial such as the lungs. Yet, the effects of pregnancy in the lung and gut microbiome remains unclear. Here we examined the changes in the gut and lung microbiome in mice at 14 days of gestation. Lung tissue and stool samples were collected from pregnant and non-pregnant female BALB/c mice, DNA was isolated, amplified, and bacterial specific V4 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Using an in-house bioinformatic pipeline we assessed the microbial composition of each organ using stool and lung tissue samples. The stool data showed that Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillaceae were more abundant in the pregnant mice. Likewise, Lactobacillaceae were dominant in the lungs of pregnant mice. However, Streptococcaceae were dominant in the lungs of non-pregnant mice with a low microbial abundance in the pregnant mice. A permutation test showed that pregnancy significantly contributes to the variance in both the lung and stool microbiome. At the same time, we estimate that 49% of the total detected operational taxonomic units were shared between the stool and lung data. After removing common stool-associated bacteria from the lung dataset, no microbial differential abundance was detected between the pregnant and non-pregnant lung microbial community. Thus, pregnancy contributes to variance to the lung and stool microbiome but not in the unique lung microbiota.<sep>Marizomib is a novel, irreversible, brain-penetrant pan-proteasome inhibitor with encouraging findings in preclinical models and early-stage clinical trials for patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. Marizomib (MRZ)-loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) (termed as MRZ-ZIF-8 @MnO2) nanoparticles, a smart-functional therapeutic system, were prepared for the treatment of glioma cancer. Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to assess the structural and morphology properties of drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs. The findings demonstrated this drug delivery carrier's narrow and particle size distribution. The anticancer drug MRZ released from the NPs was measured. The cell viability of glioma cancer cells (C6 and U87) treated with NPs was established using the cell counting kit-8. The in vitro proliferation of drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs was substantially increased than that of free MRZ and drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs treated cells. In addition, The C6 and U87 cell morphological staining studies, such as dual staining (acridine orange/ethidium bromide, AO/EB) and nuclear staining (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI), ascertain that the drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs stimulates the apoptosis in glioma cancer cell lines. The results of morphological changes show that a high apoptosis level was found with drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) validate the apoptotic mode of cancer cell death via the MMP pathway. These findings suggest that the as-fabricated MRZ-ZIF-8 @MnO2-NPs with the synergetic anticancer drug might be applied to treat glioma cancer.<sep>Parental asthma or allergy have been linked to higher risk of asthma in a child; this occurs to a variable extent in different study populations. Moreover, it is debated whether maternal more so than paternal asthma history is a stronger predisposing factor: while in some countries / populations the maternal effect was clearly seen over paternal, in others the parental effects were equivalent, and in a few studies paternal effect dominated. Here we aimed to determine parental asthma and allergy effect in the Danish GEneral SUburban population Study (GESUS). This cross-sectional study has involved 21,362 adults aged 20+ years in the suburbs of Copenhagen. We used a combination of questionnaire approach, history of prescribed asthma medications and pulmonary function testing to determine odds ratios for maternal and paternal (and combined) asthma and allergy linked to asthma in the test subjects. We found that the input of maternal vs. paternal asthma effect was approximately equal (age and sex-adjusted OR 2.46, 95% CI: 2.15-2.81 for asthmatic mothers vs. 2.97, 2.58-3.42 for asthmatic fathers), except for the “ever asthma” age and sex-adjusted odds ratios where paternal allergy seems to have conferred a marginally greater effect (age and sex-adj. OR 1.96 for maternal allergy vs. 2.44 for paternal allergy, p= 0.03). Stratifying for gestational tobacco smoking did not affect the maternal results. We conclude that in the GESUS study parental asthma or allergy were strongly linked to higher asthma risk in offspring, without a prominent maternal or paternal effect.<sep>Ziziphus mauritiana Lam leaves were utilized in treating asthma, diabetes, inflammation, and hepatic diseases in Indian traditional medicine. The leaves were used as an edible vegetables in rural parts of India.The aim is to prove the anti-inflammatory activity of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam leaves against LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and OVA-induced airway inflammation in mice through its attenuation mechanism in the NFκB signalling pathway.Terpenoids present in MEZ were quantified using U(H)PLC analysis. MEZ at 50 and 100 μg/mL were tested against LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The concentration of NO, ROS, and cytokines was quantified from the cell culture supernatants. OVA-induced asthma in mice was adopted for screening airway inflammation. MEZ at 250 and 500 mg/kg was tested for airway hyperresponsiveness, leukocyte counting, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-α), lung histopathology, and various inflammatory gene expressions in lungs for NFκB signalling pathway in asthma.Terpenoids like betulin, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid were quantified from U(H)PLC analysis. MEZ at higher doses reduced the NO, ROS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. MEZ at 500 mg/kg significantly reduced AHR and also decreased total and differential leukocytes. MEZ also reduced the expressions of ICAM, VCAM, and Muc5C genes. Histopathological analysis revealed MEZ significantly reduced the leukocyte infiltration and mucus hypersecretion in the lungs. MEZ suppressed lung inflammation by inhibition of p65 mediated IκB-α translocation in the NFκB signalling pathway.From these findings, MEZ significantly reduced airway inflammation by inhibiting NFκB mediated inflammatory pathway. Hence, this study proved that Ziziphus mauritiana Lam has anti-asthmatic potential in Indian traditional medicine.<sep>Ziziphus mauritiana (Rhamnaceae), commonly known as Ziziphus jujuba Mill, is in traditional Chinese medicine enriched with high medicinal values. In Indian and Chinese traditional medicine, a decoction of Ziziphus mauritiana leaves was used to cure insomnia, amnesia, pain, and vertigo. The study aims to determine the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam leaves to establish a rationale for their use. We studied analgesic activity by writhing and the hot plate methods in mice, whereas mechanical allodynia in rats. Also, rats were used in carrageenan anti-inflammatory and brewer's yeast-caused pyrexia. MEZ were tested at 250 and 500 mg/kg orally. Molecular docking studies between 3 inflammatory pathway proteins and natural molecules are planned and carried out. CHARMm was used for docking, and the smart minimizer algorithm was used to reduce energy. Acute toxicity testing up to 5000 mg/kg showed no deaths. Both UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis and phytochemical analysis supported the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids and saponins. At a dose of 500 mg/kg, MEZ significantly (p<0.001) reduces the perception of pain brought on by thermal, mechanical, and chemical pain models. Paw edema is dramatically reduced at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after carrageenan injection by MEZ at 500 mg/kg. Similarly, MEZ at 500 mg/kg showed a gradual drop in rectal temperatures from 3 to 9 h. The docking result illustrated that the quercetin and rutin exposed a better binding with inflammatory protein through multiple hydrogen bonds and π interactions. The findings showed that the MEZ has potential analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties at the levels studied, supporting the traditional use claim.<sep>Ziziphus mauritana Lam leaves were used to treat asthma, diabetes, pain, and inflammation in the Indian traditional system of medicine. The leaves of the Ziziphus mauritiana Lam were consumed as a vegetable in Indonesia and India. The present study aims to predict the pharmacokinetic properties of flavonoids identified & quantified through U(H)PLC and to evaluate the safety of methanol extract of Ziziphus mauritana Lam leaves (MEZ) in rats. A U(H)PLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS was performed to identify flavonoids present in MEZ and quantified using U(H)PLC method. The in-silico ADME properties of the flavonoids were analyzed using Schrodinger Maestro software. The acute oral toxicity study was performed by administering a single dose of MEZ (5000 mg/kg) in female rats and observed for 14 days. The sub-chronic studies were carried out by oral administration of MEZ at 500, 750, and 1000 mg/kg daily for 90 days. The changes in hematological parameters, clinical biochemistry, and histopathology were observed after the treatment period. Eight flavonoids rutin, kaempferol, luteolin, myricetin, catechin, and apigenin were identified from were identified in UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis. These results showed the highest amount of luteolin (5.41 μg/ml) and kaempferol (4.02 μg/ml) present in MEZ. No signs of toxicity or mortality were observed in acute toxicity studies. In the sub-chronic studies, data showed that MEZ does not produce any changes in hematological and clinical biochemical parameters compared to control rats. MEZ (1000 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total cholesterol, triglycerides, in male rats, which was more prominent on day 90. The histopathological analysis also revealed no changes in the vital organs. These results conclude that MEZ<sep>The leaves of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam have been an integral part of the traditional system of medicine for the treatment of inflammation, wounds, fever, asthma and liver disorders. The leaves are utilised as an edible vegetable in rural parts of India and Indonesia. Despite its pharmacological significance, Ziziphus mauritiana Lam lacks scientific evidence on its mutagenic and genotoxic potential. The aim of the present work is to identify bioactive compounds present in the methanol extract of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam leaves (MEZ) using HPLC-ESI-QqQ and to evaluate its mutagenic and genotoxic potential. The phytochemical standardization of the MEZ was done using HPLC-ESI-QqQ. The mutagenic and genotoxic potential of MEZ was tested using bacterial reverse mutation (Ames test), chromosomal aberration, and micronucleus tests. The Ames test was performed in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535 and TA1537, and the genotoxic potential was tested in in-vitro using chromosome aberration assay with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in-vivo micronucleus test using mouse bone marrow cells. Fifteen phytochemical compounds were identified in HPLC-ESI- QqQ. It was observed from the Ames test that MEZ did not induce gene mutations in the S. typhimurium in the presence or absence of S9 activation. Similarly, no significant increase in the number of structural aberrations was observed in CHO cells with or without S9 activation. The oral administration of MEZ at a dose of up to 2000 mg/kg caused no significant increase in the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes or in the mean ratio of polychromatic to total erythrocytes. The findings of the present study confirm that MEZ is not-mutagenic<sep>Myxopyrum serratulum A. W. Hill. (Oleaceae) is a traditionally used Indian medicinal plant for the treatment of cough, asthma and many other inflammatory diseases. In this study, the protective effects of M. serratulum on airway inflammation was investigated in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine model of allergic asthma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, and the possible mechanisms were elucidated. The phytochemicals present in the methanolic leaf extract of M. serratulum (MEMS) were identified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis. In vitro anti-inflammatory activity of MEMS were evaluated by estimating the levels of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IFN-γ, TNF-α, G-CSF and GM-CSF) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In vivo anti-asthmatic activity of MEMS was studied using OVA-induced murine model. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), was measured; total and differential cell counts, eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), NO, ROS, and cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13), were estimated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Serum total IgE level was measured; and the histopathological changes of lung tissues were observed. The expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lung tissue homogenates were detected by Western blot. The chromatographic analysis of MEMS identified the presence of gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, catechin, ellagic acid, rutin, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, naringenin and apigenin. MEMS (125 and 250 μg/mL) dose-dependently reduced the levels of NO, ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. MEMS (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly (p < 0.05) alleviated AHR; number of inflammatory cells, EPO,<sep>Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn, popularly known as the white silk-cotton tree and popularly used in Chinese and Indian traditional medicine. The bark is used to treat diarrhea, pain, fever, cardiac problems, asthma, and gastrointestinal problems. The present study aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of ethanol extract of C. pentandra bark (EECP-BK) against CCl4-induced hepatic damage in rats. Preliminary phytochemical analysis was performed to identify the bioactive compounds. CCl4 (40 mM) induced enzymatic changes at HepG2 cells were adopted for the in-vitro model. HepG2 cells were pretreated with EECP-BK (25, 50, 100, and 200 µg/ml) and standard (silymarin 12.5 µg/ml) respectively. Rat model of CCl4-induced liver damage for adopted for the in-vivo model. Rats were pretreated orally with EECP-BK 200 & 400 mg/kg and standard (silymarin 100 mg/kg) for 7 days. Rats were injected with 1 ml/kg of 50% CCl4 on day 8 to induce hepatic damage and were observed for antioxidant levels and serum biomarkers. In addition, in-silico studies have been performed to explore the binding properties of compounds from EECP-BK with tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) targeting hepatic inflammation The phytochemical analysis confirmed the presence of glycoside, steroids, phenols, tannins, and saponins. EECP-BK 200 µg/ml showed the highest protection against CCl4 in HepG2 cells. Similarly, silymarin 12.5 µg/ml showed good protection against CCl4. In rats, EECP-BK up to 2000 mg/kg did produce any toxic signs or mortality. CCl4 injection in rats showed elevated liver enzymatic and bilirubin levels and causes liver damage. It also decreased the SOD, CAT, and GSH levels.

However, the imbalance between resolution, gene capture, and field of view of current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB)-patterned arrays and in situ RNA capture to create spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). We applied Stereo-seq to generate the mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA), which maps with single-cell resolution and high sensitivity the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain. Our panoramic atlas will facilitate in-depth investigation of longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development.<sep>The molecular mechanism underlying brain regeneration in vertebrates remains elusive. We performed spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing (Stereo-seq) to capture spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes of axolotl telencephalon sections during development and regeneration. Annotated cell types exhibited distinct spatial distribution, molecular features, and functions. We identified an injury-induced ependymoglial cell cluster at the wound site as a progenitor cell population for the potential replenishment of lost neurons, through a cell state transition process resembling neurogenesis during development. Transcriptome comparisons indicated that these induced cells may originate from local resident ependymoglial cells. We further uncovered spatially defined neurons at the lesion site that may regress to an immature neuron-like state. Our work establishes spatial transcriptome profiles of an anamniote tetrapod brain and decodes potential neurogenesis from ependymoglial cells for development and regeneration, thus providing mechanistic insights into vertebrate brain regeneration.<sep>A major challenge in understanding vertebrate embryogenesis is the lack of topographical transcriptomic information that can help correlate microenvironmental cues within the hierarchy of cell-fate decisions. Here, we employed Stereo-seq to profile 91 zebrafish embryo sections covering six critical time points during the first 24 h of development, obtaining a total of 152,977 spots at a resolution of 10 × 10 × 15 μm3 (close to cellular size) with spatial coordinates. Meanwhile, we identified spatial modules and co-varying genes for specific tissue organizations. By performing the integrated analysis of the Stereo-seq and scRNA-seq data from each time point, we reconstructed the spatially resolved developmental trajectories of cell-fate transitions and molecular changes during zebrafish embryogenesis. We further investigated the spatial distribution of ligand-receptor pairs and identified potentially important interactions during zebrafish embryo development. Our study constitutes a fundamental reference for further studies aiming to understand vertebrate development.<sep>Medicinal plants constitute a source for designing clinically useful drugs targeting diseases through various mechanisms. Plant secondary metabolites can be used as lead compounds of drugs. Corynanthe alkaloids are highly abundant natural bioactive substances of various core structures possessing important properties such as nerve excitation and antimalarial and analgesic effects. In this review, we summarize and review the state-of-the-art corynanthe-type alkaloid research focusing on phytochemistry, pharmacology, and structural chemistry. Approximately 120 articles reporting 231 alkaloids classified into simple corynanthe, yohimbine, oxindole corynanthe, mavacurane, sarpagine, akuammiline, strychnos, and ajmaline-type groups were compiled. Relevant biological properties discussed include antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, muscle-relaxant, vasorelaxant, and analgesic activities and activities affecting the main nervous and cardiac systems, as well as NF-κB inhibitory and Na+-glucose cotransporter inhibitory properties. This review provides insights and a reference for future studies, thus paving the way for the discovery of drugs based on corynanthe alkaloids.<sep>Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is Earth’s most abundant wild animal, and its enormous biomass is vital to the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Here, we report a 48.01-Gb chromosome-level Antarctic krill genome, whose large genome size appears to have resulted from inter-genic transposable element expansions. Our assembly reveals the molecular architecture of the Antarctic krill circadian clock and uncovers expanded gene families associated with molting and energy metabolism, providing insights into adaptations to the cold and highly seasonal Antarctic environment. Population-level genome re-sequencing from four geographical sites around the Antarctic continent reveals no clear population structure but highlights natural selection associated with environmental variables. An apparent drastic reduction in krill population size 10 mya and a subsequent rebound 100 thousand years ago coincides with climate change events. Our findings uncover the genomic basis of Antarctic krill adaptations to the Southern Ocean and provide valuable resources for future Antarctic research.<sep>Abstract Global profile of gene expression at single-cell resolution remains to be determined for primates. Using a recently developed technology (“Stereo-seq”), we have obtained a comprehensive single-cell spatial transcriptome map at the whole-brain level for cynomolgus monkeys, with ∼600 genes per cell for 10 μm-thick coronal sections (up to 15 cm 2 in size). Large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis for ∼1 million cells helped to identify cell types corresponding to Stereo-seq gene expression profiles, providing a 3-D cell type atlas of the monkey brain. Quantitative analysis of Stereo-seq data revealed molecular fingerprints that mark distinct neocortical layers and subregions, as well as domains within subcortical structures including hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum, hypothalamus and claustrum. Striking whole-brain topography and coordinated patterns were found in the expression of genes encoding receptors and transporters for neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. These results pave the way for cellular and molecular understanding of organizing principles of the primate brain.<sep>Abstract A comprehensive atlas of genes, cell types, and their spatial distribution across a whole mammalian brain is fundamental for understanding function of the brain. Here, using snRNA-seq and Stereo-seq techniques, we generated a mouse brain atlas with spatial information for 308 cell clusters with single-cell resolution involving over 6 million cells as well as for 29,655 genes. We have identified new astrocyte clusters, and demonstrated that distinct cell clusters exhibit preference for cortical subregions. In addition, we identified 155 genes exhibiting regional specificity in the brainstem, and 513 long non-coding RNA exhibited regional specificity in the adult brain. Parcellation of brain regions based on spatial transcriptomic information showed large overlap with that by traditional method. Furthermore, we have uncovered 411 transcription factor regulons with spatiotemporal specificity during development. Thus, our study has discovered genes and regulon with spatiotemporal specificity, and provided a high-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of the mouse brain.<sep>Elucidating the cellular organization of the cerebral cortex is critical for understanding brain structure and function. Using large-scale single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analysis of 143 macaque cortical regions, we obtained a comprehensive atlas of 264 transcriptome-defined cortical cell types and mapped their spatial distribution across the entire cortex. We characterized the cortical layer and region preferences of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and non-neuronal cell types, as well as regional differences in cell-type composition and neighborhood complexity. Notably, we discovered a relationship between the regional distribution of various cell types and the region's hierarchical level in the visual and somatosensory systems. Cross-species comparison of transcriptomic data from human, macaque, and mouse cortices further revealed primate-specific cell types that are enriched in layer 4, with their marker genes expressed in a region-dependent manner. Our data provide a cellular and molecular basis for understanding the evolution, development, aging, and pathogenesis of the primate brain.<sep>SUMMARY Spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies are promising tools to study cell fate decisions in a physical microenvironment, which is fundamental for enhancing our knowledge of mammalian development. However, the imbalance between resolution, transcript capture and field of view of current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation mammalian embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB) patterned arrays and tissue RNA capture to create SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). This approach allows transcriptomic profiling of large histological sections with high resolution and sensitivity. We have applied Stereo-seq to study the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation in a time course of mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of regional specification, neuronal migration and differentiation in the developing brain. Furthermore, we mapped the expression of a panel of developmental disease-related loci on our global transcriptomic maps to define the spatiotemporal windows of tissue vulnerability. Our panoramic atlas constitutes an essential resource to investigate longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development.<sep>Abstract Recent technological developments in spatial transcriptomics allow researchers to measure gene expression of cells and their spatial locations at the single-cell level, generating detailed biological insight into biological processes. A comprehensive database could facilitate the sharing of spatial transcriptomic data and streamline the data acquisition process for researchers. Here, we present the Spatial TranscriptOmics DataBase (STOmicsDB), a database that serves as a one-stop hub for spatial transcriptomics. STOmicsDB integrates 218 manually curated datasets representing 17 species. We annotated cell types, identified spatial regions and genes, and performed cell-cell interaction analysis for these datasets. STOmicsDB features a user-friendly interface for the rapid visualization of millions of cells. To further facilitate the reusability and interoperability of spatial transcriptomic data, we developed standards for spatial transcriptomic data archiving and constructed a spatial transcriptomic data archiving system. Additionally, we offer a distinctive capability of customizing dedicated sub-databases in STOmicsDB for researchers, assisting them in visualizing their spatial transcriptomic analyses. We believe that STOmicsDB could contribute to research insights in the spatial transcriptomics field, including data archiving, sharing, visualization and analysis. STOmicsDB is freely accessible at https://db.cngb.org/stomics/.<sep>The H7 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIV) have a much longer history and their adaptation through evolution pose continuous threat to humans 1 . Since 2013 March, the novel reasserted H7N9 subtype have transmitted to humans through their repeated assertion in the poultry market. Through repeated transmission, H7N9 gradually became the second AIV subtype posing greater public health risk after H5N1 2,3 . After infection, how the virus tunes its genome to adapt and evolve in humans remains unknown. Through direct amplification of H7N9 and high throughput (HT) sequencing of full genomes from the swabs and lower respiratory tract samples collected from infected patients in Shenzhen, China, we have analyzed the in vivo H7N9 mutations at the level of whole genomes and have compared with the genomes derived by in vitro cultures. These comparisons and frequency analysis against the H7N9 genomes in the public database, 40 amino acids were identified that play potential roles in virus adaptation during H7N9 infection in humans. Various synonymous mutations were also identified that might be crucial to H7N9 adaptation in humans. The mechanism of these mutations occurred in a single infection are discussed in this study.<sep>Rice (Oryza sativa) molecular breeding has gained considerable attention in recent years, but inaccurate genome annotation hampers its progress and functional studies of the rice genome. In this study, we applied single-molecule long-read RNA sequencing (lrRNA_seq)-based proteogenomics to reveal the complexity of the rice transcriptome and its coding abilities. Surprisingly, approximately 60% of loci identified by lrRNA_seq are associated with natural antisense transcripts (NATs). The high-density genomic arrangement of NAT genes suggests their potential roles in the multifaceted control of gene expression. In addition, a large number of fusion and intergenic transcripts have been observed. Furthermore, 906,456 transcript isoforms were identified, and 72.9% of the genes can generate splicing isoforms. A total of 706,075 posttranscriptional events were subsequently categorized into 10 subtypes, demonstrating the interdependence of posttranscriptional mechanisms that contribute to transcriptome diversity. Parallel short-read RNA sequencing indicated that lrRNA_seq has a superior capacity for the identification of longer transcripts. In addition, over 190,000 unique peptides belonging to 9,706 proteoforms/protein groups were identified, expanding the diversity of the rice proteome. Our findings indicate that the genome organization, transcriptome diversity, and coding potential of the rice transcriptome are far more complex than previously anticipated.<sep>Abstract Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, and an early diagnosis is required for a favorable prognosis. Histological examination is the gold standard for cancer identification; however, large amount of inter-observer variability exists in histological diagnosis. Numerous studies have shown cancer genesis is accompanied by an accumulation of harmful mutations, potentiating the identification of cancer based on genomic information. We have proposed a method, GDL (genome deep learning), to study the relationship between genomic variations and traits based on deep neural networks. We analyzed 6,083 samples’ WES (Whole Exon Sequencing) mutations files from 12 cancer types obtained from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and 1,991 healthy samples’ WES data from the 1000 Genomes project. We constructed 12 specific models to distinguish between certain type of cancer and healthy tissues, a total-specific model that can identify healthy and cancer tissues, and a mixture model to distinguish between all 12 types of cancer based on GDL. We demonstrate that the accuracy of specific, mixture and total specific model are 97.47%, 70.08% and 94.70% for cancer identification. We developed an efficient method for the identification of cancer based on genomic information that offers a new direction for disease diagnosis.<sep>SUMMARY Brain regeneration requires a precise coordination of complex responses in a time- and region-specific manner. Identifying key cell types and molecules that direct brain regeneration would provide potential targets for the advance of regenerative medicine. However, progress in the field has been hampered largely due to limited regeneration capacity of the mammalian brain and understanding of the regeneration process at both cellular and molecular level. Here, using axolotl brain with extrodinary regeneration ability upon injury, and the SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we reconstructed the first architecture of axolotl telencephalon with gene expression profiling at single-cell resolution, and fine cell dynamics maps throughout development and regeneration. Intriguingly, we discovered a marked heterogeneity of radial glial cell (RGC) types with distinct behaviors. Of note, one subtype of RGCs is activated since early regeneration stages and proliferates while other RGCs remain dormant. Such RGC subtype appears to be the major cell population involved in early wound healing response and gradually covers the injured area before presumably transformed into the lost neurons. Altogether, our work systematically decoded the complex cellular and molecular dynamics of axolotl telencephalon in development and regeneration, laying the foundation for studying the regulatory mechanism of brain regeneration in the future.</abstract>", "<keyword>Neurofibromatosis type 2<sep>Epigenetics<sep>RNA<sep>Epigenesis<sep>Immunogenicity<sep>Small interfering RNA<sep>Synovial sarcoma<sep>Immune system<sep>Cell<sep>Schwann cell<sep>Glioblastoma<sep>PDGFRA<sep>Chromatin<sep>Schwannoma<sep>RNA interference<sep>Transcriptome<sep>Gene expression<sep>Sarcoma<sep>Gene<sep>Gene silencing</keyword><title>An Integrative Model of Cellular States, Plasticity, and Genetics for Glioblastoma<sep>Opposing immune and genetic forces shape oncogenic programs in synovial sarcoma<sep>Opposing immune and genetic mechanisms shape oncogenic programs in synovial sarcoma<sep>Traitements à siRNA : état des lieux et perspectives<sep>EPCO-03. A COMPREHENSIVE SINGLE-CELL ATLAS OF SCHWANNOMA REVEALS CONSERVED CELLULAR STATES ACROSS DIFFERENT GENETIC BACKGROUNDS AND ANATOMIC LOCATIONS</title><abstract>Diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental programs drive glioblastoma, an incurable and poorly understood tumor, but their precise characterization remains challenging. Here, we use an integrative approach spanning single-cell RNA-sequencing of 28 tumors, bulk genetic and expression analysis of 401 specimens from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), functional approaches, and single-cell lineage tracing to derive a unified model of cellular states and genetic diversity in glioblastoma. We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers.<sep>ABSTRACT Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive mesenchymal neoplasm, driven by the SS18-SSX fusion, and characterized by immunogenic antigens expression and exceptionally low T cell infiltration levels. To study the cancer-immune interplay in this disease, we profiled 16,872 cells from 12 human synovial sarcoma tumors using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Synovial sarcoma manifests antitumor immunity, high cellular plasticity and a core oncogenic program, which is predictive of low immune levels and poor clinical outcomes. Using genetic and pharmacological perturbations, we demonstrate that the program is controlled by the SS18-SSX driver and repressed by cytokines secreted by macrophages and T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Network modeling predicted that SS18-SSX promotes the program through HDAC1 and CDK6. Indeed, the combination of HDAC and CDK4/6 inhibitors represses the program, induces immunogenic cell states, and selectively targets synovial sarcoma cells. Our study demonstrates that immune evasion, cellular plasticity, and cell cycle are co-regulated and can be co-targeted in synovial sarcoma and potentially in other malignancies.<sep>Synovial sarcoma (SyS) is an aggressive neoplasm driven by the SS18-SSX fusion, and is characterized by low T cell infiltration. Here, we studied the cancer-immune interplay in SyS using an integrative approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial profiling and genetic and pharmacological perturbations. scRNA-seq of 16,872 cells from 12 human SyS tumors uncovered a malignant subpopulation that marks immune-deprived niches in situ and is predictive of poor clinical outcomes in two independent cohorts. Functional analyses revealed that this malignant cell state is controlled by the SS18-SSX fusion, is repressed by cytokines secreted by macrophages and T cells, and can be synergistically targeted with a combination of HDAC and CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors. This drug combination enhanced malignant-cell immunogenicity in SyS models, leading to induced T cell reactivity and T cell-mediated killing. Our study provides a blueprint for investigating heterogeneity in fusion-driven malignancies and demonstrates an interplay between immune evasion and oncogenic processes that can be co-targeted in SyS and potentially in other malignancies.<sep>Biomedical research and the pharmaceutical industry constantly explore new therapeutic strategies. A growing understanding of genetic diseases has enabled the development of «gene therapies». These can act either by inducing the expression of deficient genes or by silencing pathological ones. Therapies using small interfering RNA (siRNA) form a new class of treatments capable of targeting and specifically inhibiting a gene of interest. First by using lipid nanoparticles and then by engineering specific chemical modifications, progress has been made in delivering siRNA specifically into hepatocytes, representing a particular interest in the field of hepatology. The aim of this review article is to describe the mode of action of siRNA therapeutics, to review currently available treatments as well as their application, and to enumerate future treatment possibilities that are still under development.La recherche biomédicale et l’industrie pharmaceutique s’intéressent au développement constant de nouvelles thérapies. Notre compréhension grandissante des maladies génétiques a permis le développement de nouvelles thérapies, dites « thérapies géniques ». Celles-ci peuvent viser à induire l’expression d’un gène lorsqu’il est déficient ou au contraire l’inhiber lorsqu’il est délétère. Les thérapies à siRNA (small interfering RNA) représentent une nouvelle classe de traitements permettant de cibler et d’inhiber spécifiquement un gène d’intérêt. Grâce à l’utilisation de nanoparticules lipidiques puis à l’aide de modifications chimiques spécifiques, des mécanismes efficaces ont été développés pour délivrer les siRNA dans les cellules du foie, représentant un intérêt particulier en hépatologie. Le but de cet article est de résumer le mode d’action des traitements à siRNA, de discuter des traitements disponibles et leur application ainsi que ceux en cours de développement.<sep>Abstract BACKGROUND Despite being associated with molecular alterations in the NF2 gene, there is limited understanding of the gene expression programs that govern the behavior of schwannomas both in sporadic cases as well as in patients with schwannoma predisposition syndromes, and also with respect to their anatomic location. METHODS We characterized the transcriptional heterogeneity of schwannomas across different genetic backgrounds and anatomic locations at the single-cell level. Tumor samples from patients undergoing resection for symptomatic schwannoma were dissociated and single cells were processed for full-transcript whole transcriptome profiling via Smart-seq2. Our cohort of 22 schwannomas, includes 5 tumors from schwannomatosis patients, 11 tumors from neurofibromatosis type 2 patients, and 6 sporadic tumors – 3 of which had grown after radiation treatment. Anatomically, 12 tumors were excised from cranial nerves (11 vestibular, 1 accessory) and 10 from spinal and other peripheral nerves. RESULTS We profiled 11,373 cells, including 4725 neoplastic cells, 2425 fibroblasts, 1314 T cells, 1258 endothelial cells, 969 myeloid cells, 503 pericytes and 240 Schwann cells. Copy number alteration analyses reveal evidence of intratumoral polyclonality (supporting the hypothesis of multiple sites of origin for a tumor). Using non-negative matrix factorization, we identify 6 distinct transcriptional metaprograms, with gene signatures related to stress, myelin production, antigen presentation, interferon signaling, glycolysis and extracellular matrix. After comparison with a pan-cancer gene expression dataset, we note unique interferon and antigen presentation metaprograms in schwannoma, with the latter being mainly characterized by expression of MHC Class II genes. Overall, we observe conserved expression of these metaprograms across anatomic locations and genetic backgrounds, with the exception of decreased interferon signaling for vestibular tumors. CONCLUSION We provide a comprehensive single-cell characterization of schwannoma spanning diverse genetic and anatomic backgrounds. We describe unique transcriptional metaprograms for antigen presentation and interferon signaling, which might underlie mechanisms for immune evasion.</abstract>", "<keyword>Feature (linguistics)<sep>Stress (linguistics)<sep>Ranking (information retrieval)<sep>Quarantine<sep>Poison control<sep>Beneficiation<sep>Geographic coordinate system<sep>Virtual reality<sep>Facility location problem<sep>Order (exchange)<sep>Bottleneck<sep>Productivity<sep>Field (mathematics)<sep>Mineral processing<sep>Economic order quantity<sep>Lean manufacturing<sep>Manufacturing<sep>Computer-aided process planning<sep>Pareto principle<sep>Sustainability<sep>Software<sep>Product design<sep>CAD<sep>Curriculum<sep>Maintainability<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Key (lock)<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Trailer<sep>Selection (genetic algorithm)<sep>Position (finance)<sep>Value (mathematics)<sep>Goodwill<sep>Competitor analysis<sep>Workload<sep>Cog<sep>Procurement<sep>Computation<sep>Feature recognition<sep>Analytic hierarchy process<sep>Virtual learning environment<sep>Clamping<sep>Control reconfiguration<sep>Reliability (semiconductor)<sep>Machine tool<sep>Scheduling (production processes)<sep>Dynamic programming<sep>Human factors and ergonomics<sep>Machining<sep>Value stream mapping<sep>Universal testing machine<sep>Power consumption<sep>Work (physics)<sep>Pairwise comparison<sep>Supply chain<sep>Engineering design process<sep>Big data<sep>Component (thermodynamics)<sep>Flexibility (engineering)<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Immersive technology<sep>Product (mathematics)<sep>Welding<sep>Production (economics)<sep>Supplier relationship management<sep>Mining industry<sep>Sheet metal</keyword><title>Immersive Virtual Work Integrated Learning: A Development of an Interactive Learning Environment for Rail Components Manufacturing<sep>A Framework for a Reconfigurable Welding Jig for Sheet Metal Panel Component of a Railcar<sep>Web-based process planning system concept selection using Weighted Decision Matrix and Analytical Hierarchy Process: A case study of sheet metal bending operations<sep>SIMULATION-AIDED VALUE STREAM MAPPING FOR PRODUCTIVITY PROGRESSION IN A STEEL SHAFT MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT<sep>State of the art applications of engineering graphics and design to enhance innovative product design: a systematic review<sep>Development and performance evaluation of a web-based feature extraction and recognition system for sheet metal bending process planning operations<sep>Application of Reconfigurable System Thinking in Reconfigurable Bending Machine and Assembly Systems<sep>Immersive Virtual Work Integrated Learning: A Scoping Review<sep>A dynamic programming model for Reconfigurable Vibrating Screen machine operations planning in a fluctuating market environment<sep>Development of a supplier assessment form for an electronic product manufacturing organisation<sep>Analysis and performance investigation of a reconfigurable vibrating screen machine for mining and mineral processing industries<sep>Assessment of Reconfigurable Vibrating Screen Technology for the Mining Industries<sep>A Hybrid Structural Interaction Matrix Approach to Prioritise Process Wastes Generated in a Manufacturing Organisation<sep>A Model to Balance Production Workload Distribution in a Trailer Manufacturing Organisation Under Fluctuating Customer Ordering Condition<sep>Performance evaluation of the supply chain system of a food product manufacturing system using a questionnaire-based approach<sep>Analysis of factors and solutions to poor supply chain quality in a manufacturing organisation<sep>An approach to estimate the back order penalty cost of a manufacturing company<sep>Assessment of Ergonomics Risk Experienced by Welding Workers in a Rail Component Manufacturing Organization<sep>Establishment of an Appropriate Data Analytic Platform for Developing a Wisdom Manufacturing System Using Decision Techniques<sep>Design and Structural Analysis of a Welding Jig for Part Family Assembly of the Top and Lower Brackets of a Railcar<sep>FR/CoG multi-attribute-based comparison methods for selection of the location of a research institute<sep>Prioritizing factors influencing the selection of a suitable quarantine facility for COVID-19 patients using Pareto-enhanced analytical hierarchy process</title><abstract>Abstract Undergraduate students pursuing their studies in the engineering discipline in higher education institutions (HEI) are expected to complete their work integrated learning (WIL) component as part of their curriculum. This is a compulsory module traditionally performed in the workplace environment over a specified time. However, with the scarcity of placement-based WIL, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a reduction in the intake of students to accomplish their studies. This paper presents, a human centered design (HCD) model for developing an immersive virtual reality (IVR) rendered with an HTC Vive Pro head mounted display (HMDs) platform capable of training industrial engineering undergraduate students on the manufacturing procedure of rail components using a reconfigurable guillotine shear and bending press machine (RGS&amp;BPM) as part of the set of immersive virtual work integrated learning (IVWIL) activities.

A framework for the reconfiguration of a welding jig was proposed in this study, which takes into consideration some design considerations in order to tackle some challenges identified in the existing jigs. The implementation of the proposed design framework will minimize the challenges identified and the resultant effect will bring about good dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the work piece. It will also bring about increase in welding time with reduction in the efficiency of welding. The reconfigurable welding jig design framework proposed in this study unveils the best possible way for clamping, location and rearrangement of the jigs component and its accessories for optimum performance and safety.

Sheet metal industries are still using traditional system planning methods, which have limited capacity to respond to rapid changes in market requirements. In light of this, this paper proposes a suitable web-based process planning system that can be used to effectively bend varieties of sheet metal products using various bending press machines. Three web-based process planning system concepts were formulated in this study and evaluated using various criteria. The result of the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analyses revealed that web-based process planning system concept Y with a cumulative assessment score of 1.90 and a priority assessment score of 0.637 is the suitable web-based process planning system that could be used to effectively bend varieties of sheet metals.

In the past decade, the steel shaft manufacturing industry has experienced low productivity rates, making it difficult to compete at a global level. In light of this, the aim of this research study is to investigate the various process wastes and bottlenecks that limit the productivity progression of a steel shaft manufacturing environment, using integrated value stream mapping and system simulation methodologies. Data captured through the system observation of the shaft manufacturing process of a steel company was used to map and simulate the system. The results of the current state mapping of the steel shaft manufacturing environment revealed the various process wastes present in this system. The result of the simulation of the system revealed that the system bottlenecks were the saw master and milling stations. The strategic interventions in the saw master and milling stations improved these stations throughput from 959 to 1 218<sep>The skills and abilities that Engineering Graphics and Design (EGD) has to offer is critical to support creation of product design in various fields such as architecture, mechanical, electrical, civil etc. To date, the knowledge of EGD in the product design process has not been fully harnessed by design experts in the field. Thus, this study aims to investigate the applications of EGD and provide its prospects in various technical fields to enhance future product design process. In this study, a systematic literature review using articles from various academic research data bases were used. The results of the study revealed that application of EGD in product design originates back from the creation traditional drawing to more sophisticated three dimensional methods of drafting such as computer aided design (CAD).

This is due to globalisation and the rapid change in market demands for sheet metal products. In light of this, this paper proposes a web-based feature extraction and recognition system. The system would ensure automated planning of various processes used by a bending machine to produce varieties of sheet metal products. The algorithms were implemented using C++ to produce the geometric and feature models used to extract, and recognise the bending features in various CAD files acquired from literature. Five (5) CAD files of various sheet metals were utilised to test the functionality of this system. The results from the feature recognition process have proven to be precisely what the user has designed and saved in the model file. Bend radius and bend angle. Finally, the developed system is able to transform a STEP file into a feature model and display the 3D<sep>Press brake machines (PBMs) are known as tools that uses pressure to cut, shape or bend sheet metals into various geometries using combination of a punch and a die. The slow evolution of press machines is driven by drawbacks such as complex structures, excessive energy consumption, intense heat generation, high noise levels, serious vibrations, and high precision requirements. The next generation of PBMs will require automatic and synchronized system, suitable for the press tool operations, versatile in raising and thrusting of multiple-cylinders with odd and even numbers through application of agent-based technologies. This process allows increase or reduction of output power during the bending process compared to conventional sheet metal forming processes. Taking this into consideration, the proposed chapter deliberates in detail; the progression, factors of emergence, classification, types, characteristics, enabling tools and technologies, challenges, contributions, and case studies of reconfigurable machines in nonconventional machining areas for efficient production of components and parts used in manufacturing industries. In addition, related maintenance solutions for proposed machines<sep>Undergraduate students were not spared by the negative effect of covid 19, some could not access placement, and some were dismissed from doing their work integrated learning (WIL) curriculum. The application of Virtual Reality (VR) in education training, has lately shown a tremendous interest, several authors have investigated the benefits and applications of this technology in various scenarios. However, fewer scoping review studies presently exist on how researchers have applied immersive virtual reality (IVR) for work integrated learning purposes in higher education institutions (HEI). A total of 25 published studies in the period of 2015-2022 were selected for screening and selection to analyze the topic. This scoping review present how IVR supported instructional design methods, development tools and evaluation criteria for virtual work integrated learning (VWIL). The result of the review highlights that IVR has greatly aided in providing solution to the scarcity of placement-based WIL, the negative effects of Covid 19 and has exposed the need to adopt industry 4.0 technology in academia. It<sep>Fluctuation in mineral concentrates demand has resulted into the design of a Reconfigurable Vibrating Screen (RVS) machine. However, the question; “which configuration(s) should this machine be configured to, at different periods in order to minimize the total operating cost of utilizing this machine in meeting the fluctuating customer demands?” still need to be answered by the designer of the machine. In light of this, this paper proposes a dynamic programming model that will ensure cost-effective configuration and utilization of the RVS machine in meeting fluctuating customers demand. The dynamic programming model was tested using the mineral concentrates demand of mining company XYZ. The results of the dynamic computation for this case study revealed that RVS machine must be operated using a configuration sequence of 4700mm × 2500mm, 3500mm × 2000mm and 4700mm × 2500mm, for a period of first two (2) months, second two (2) months and the last month respectively, in order to meet the customer’s five-month period demand in mining company XYZ, at<sep>Smooth running and optimal flow of the supply chain system of an electronic product manufacturing organisation solely rely on the just-in-time (JIT) availability of raw materials required by various manufacturing processes of an organisation. Hence, the selection of suitable suppliers that meet the key strategic objectives required to ensure effective functioning of end-to-end processes of an organisation is vital to ensure sustainable manufacturing in an organisation. In light of this, the aim of this study is to develop a supplier assessment form that could be used by a procurement manager of an electronic product manufacturing organisation to select a suitable supplier of their raw materials. In order to achieve this, various criteria were appraised and utilised to establish the key indicators that should be used to rate the performance of suppliers, with a view to establishing a suitable raw material supplier. The result of the criteria assessment revealed that the criterion “supplier resilience” with a priority score of 0.30 is the most important criterion for<sep>Reconfigurable Vibrating Screen (RVS) machine is an innovative beneficiation solution designed for screening mineral particle into various sizes and volumes demanded by the customers at any particular time in a cost-effective manner. In order to ensure optimal functionality, reliability and maintain ability of the RVS machine when used in the mining industry. There is a need to investigate the performace of this machine using smart measurement and monitoring technology in order to effective using data acquisition system; DAQ which recover raw perfromance data via the sensor connencted to be machine. Multi-point modelling experiments were conducted in order to measure stress distributions on various sub-components of the RVS machine at different configurations of 305 mm × 610 mm, 305 mm × 1220 mm and 610 mm × 1220 mm respectively. Furthermore, sets of experiments were conducted to determine the stress distribution experienced on the RVS machine structure using the worst loading conditions. The results of the experimental study revealed that the current stresses on the RVS<sep>Abstract Vibrating screens are very vital in the mineral processing industries for the beneficiation (separation) of mineral particles into different sizes. The breaking down of vibrating screens due to unforeseen contingencies have reduced the productivity of these machines thereby reducing the competitiveness, availability and reliability of these machines for the set production target made by the company. Also since human wants are insatiable, fluctuation in the mineral concentrates demands has been an inevitable scenario, thus, reducing the efficiency of the mineral beneficiation industries. During peak mineral concentrates demand, most of these industries do not have an option than to purchase another beneficiation screen in order to meet up with the continuously increasing production demand. A solution called the Reconfigurable Vibrating Screen (RVS) that can cover the gaps created by machine breakdown, and ensure that the variations in quantity of mineral concentrates needed by customers are met. In this paper, a state of configurations achieved by RVS as compared to the existing conventional vibrating screens was<sep>Abstract The productivity of a manufacturing organisation is limited by myriads of process wastes generated in this organisation. In light of this, the aim of this study is to prioritise various process wastes generated in a manufacturing organisation. In order to achieve this, on the one hand, a Hybrid Structural Interaction Matrix (HSIM), which is premised on the theory of subordination via systems thinking was deployed to carry out the process wastes pairwise ranking and weighting analysis. On the other hand, the Pareto Chart, was thereafter deployed to ascertain the vital few process wastes contributing to productivity loss experienced in a manufacturing organisation. A case study of the process wastes generated in an Electronic-Product Manufacturing organisation was used to validate the process wastes prioritisation model developed in this study. The result of the HSIM prioritisation analysis revealed that the intensity rating scores of the process wastes; overproduction, excess inventory, defect, motion, transport, waiting and over-processing limiting the productivity of an organisation are 7.53, 4.59, 6.06,<sep>Abstract Trailer manufacturing organisation considered in this study is currently experiencing a high volume of backlog orders due to its poor balancing of production workload distribution during capacity planning and scheduling. This issue has resulted in loss of sales orders experienced by the trailer manufacturing organisation. In light of this, this research study developed a model that could be used to balance production workload distribution that could be used to timeously meet varying customer orders as well as drastically minimise the backlog cost experienced in a trailer manufacturing organisation. To achieve this, on the one hand, a system model of the current production workload distribution used at this trailer manufacturing organisation was developed using AnyLogic software and parametrized using the manufacturing system operation operating conditions obtained via system observation for a period of three (3) months, in order to identify the bottleneck stations and inefficiencies present within this organisation. On the other hand, design of experiments, equipped with feasible workload control strategies were conducted on<sep>Effective management of the end-to-end process of a food industry is vital for the achievement of the key strategic objectives of this organisation. However, various factors have limited the performance and productivity of the supply chain system of food industries; thus hindering an organisation from meeting its customers demand target. Hence; there is a need to appraise the performance of the supply chain system of a food industry with a view to identify factors limiting its performance and ensure continuous end-to-end process improvement. In light of this, this paper assesses the performance of the supply chain system of a food industry using a questionnaire-based approach. The structure of the questionnaire consists of myriad of questions that appraises the performance of various factors responsible for effective functioning and optimal flow of the supplier and production sections of the supply chain of a food industry based on the industry benchmark for these factors. The production operators responded to the appropriate sections of the questionnaire. The questionnaire result<sep>Background: With about 55% of operating costs in manufacturing organisations coming from costs of supply chains, coupled with a 6% increase in supply chain costs incurred by a manufacturing organisation during the financial year 2021–2022, supply chain managers need to ascertain factors contributing to high supply operating cost and ascertain suitable strategies to lower supply chain management cost.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to unveil the factors and the solutions to poor supply chain quality in a steel product manufacturing organisation.Method: A qualitative approach conducted via an interview guide was used in this study. Perceptions of key supply chain stakeholders within a steel product manufacturing organisation formed the basis of the exploring factors contributing to poor supply chain quality and the solutions thereof. The Pareto chart was created to ascertain the critical factors that contribute to poor supply chain quality.Results: The study revealed that inventory stock-out, management decisions, process deviations, longer lead times, suppliers and unreliable enterprise resource planning (ERP) system issues contributed to<sep>Abstract The classical inventory models solely rely on accurate estimate of the back order cost, with a view to establish economic order quantity (EOQ) that must be placed by a customer. Recognizing and quantifying the adverse effects of loss of customer goodwill owing to the inability of a raw material or product supplier organisation to meet customer demands should not only focus on direct penalty cost computation, but should also incorporate change in customers’ future demand owing to this backordering phenomenon. A lot of classical and mathematical approaches focused on the computation of the back order penalty cost coefficient; which gives an organisation a clue of the customer disappointment index, and not the estimated back order cost required for EOQ computation. In light of this, this paper proposes an approach that could be utilized to accurately compute the back order penalty cost of an organisation. The approach considers: (i) the number of times backordering phenomenon have occurred in an organisation, (ii) the decision a customer<sep>Abstract The various types of welding workstation designs used in a rail component manufacturing system environment have drawn the attention of industrial engineers to the safety and efficiency of the workers during welding operations. Welding operations are carried out using several posture configurations, which have a negative physical ergonomic impact on the workers, especially in manual welding processes. This empirical research investigates the ergonomics conditions of welding workplaces with the aim of ascertaining the disorders that may be associated with working posture during welding operations among the South African population. Twenty-seven (27) welders were randomly selected, and data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The majority (67 percent of the welders) stated that they experience discomfort and pain whilst they carry out their task, which contradicts ergonomic guidelines for working posture. Forty-eight percent of the welding workers were frequently physically tired. Sixty-three (63) percent agree that they perform repetitive tasks, and a majority of 78% of welding workers reported neck discomfort as a result of<sep>Abstract In today’s global business context, data has played a critical role in ensuring accurate and appropriate decision making in manufacturing organisations. Despite the huge pool of information (i.e. data) generated by consumers, repair or maintenance shops, manufacturing job shop, scientific society on various products, which could be deployed by manufacturers in eliciting vital information towards achieving sustainable product design and development, only few manufacturers are making use of this data to generate wisdom required for sustainable manufacturing. This act is caused by lack of appropriate systems capable of integrating the available data and make wise inferences that will result in a competitive advantage of a specific organisation over its competitors. In light of this, the aim of this study is to establish a suitable data analytic platform that could be used to sort, classify and integrate data required to generate wisdom vital for sustainable manufacturing. In order to achieve this, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was deployed to appraise various alternative data analytical platforms such<sep>The need to localize the manufacturing of rail car in South Africa has prompted the need for the design and prototyping of various components of a rail car, with a view to expedite the revenue generation of the country and create job opportunities for the vibrant youths of the country. In light of this, this paper presents a detailed design and simulation of a mechanically-operated welding jig system, capable of effectively joining individual subcomponents of top bracket components of a rail car together. The welding jig system, capable of meeting the design requirements, was conceptualized and drawn using ANSYS Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. The results of the stress simulations on the top brackets to be welded, were carried out in the ANSYS environment. The results show that the jig can hold the workpiece without failure or workpiece distortion after the addition of the spacer support system to the side plates of the jig system. The stress induced with the addition of the spacer was<sep>Purpose The determination of the appropriate site for the location of a research institute represents a multi-criteria problem which requires a scientific approach for decision-making. The research centre in this study is an institute that intends to carry out the state-of-the-art research activities and provide the requisite skills to expedite and optimize the manufacturing of rail cars in South Africa. Hence, the selection of a suitable and conducive location capable of achieving these aforementioned objectives in an effective manner is a problem which requires scientific justification for the allocation of the weights and biases. In light of this, using various decision techniques, this paper aims to establish a suitable framework for the location selection of the research institute which is capable of meeting the short- and long-term objectives of the institute. Design/methodology/approach This aim was achieved by ascertaining the suitability of potential location alternatives using the factor rating (FR) and centre of gravity (CoG) technique.

Quarantine facility in this study is a facility that intends to harbour and treat individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 to prevent the widespread of the virus. COVID-19 is a very contagious pandemic disease, hence, the establishment of critical factors that will embrace the selection of a suitable quarantine facility is of high importance. This paper aims to ascertain the vital few factors that must be considered by decision makers in selecting a suitable quarantine facility. Design/methodology/approach The aim of this study was achieved through the numerical assessment of identified quarantine location selection factors using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and Pareto techniques. The factors, which influences the selection of a suitable quarantine facility for COVID-19 patients were first identified from the literature followed by the pairwise comparison of the factors and random consistency analyses, as well as the ranking of the alternatives</abstract>", "<keyword>Tumor microenvironment<sep>Fibrosis<sep>Sepsis<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Spleen<sep>Monocyte<sep>Inflammation<sep>Liver injury<sep>Intensive care unit<sep>Cardiopulmonary bypass<sep>CCR2<sep>Cardiac surgery<sep>Immune system<sep>Intensive care<sep>Hepatocyte<sep>C-C chemokine receptor type 7<sep>CD14<sep>Angiogenesis<sep>Natural killer T cell<sep>Chemokine<sep>Cytotoxic T cell<sep>CD16<sep>CCL4<sep>CD8<sep>Myeloid<sep>Adoptive cell transfer<sep>CX3CR1</keyword><title>CXCR6 protects from inflammation and fibrosis in NEMOLPC-KO mice<sep>Differential Gene Expression in Circulating CD14+ Monocytes Indicates the Prognosis of Critically Ill Patients with Sepsis<sep>Elevated circulating CD14++CD16+ intermediate monocytes are independently associated with extracardiac complications after cardiac surgery<sep>CX3CR1 Mediates the Development of Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells during Hepatic Inflammation<sep>The CCR2+ Macrophage Subset Promotes Pathogenic Angiogenesis for Tumor Vascularization in Fibrotic Livers<sep>C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) regulates hepatic CD8+ T cell homeostasis and response to acute liver injury<sep>Hepatic C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6–expressing innate lymphocytes limit detrimental myeloid hyperactivation in acute liver injury<sep>CXCR6 Inhibits Hepatocarcinogenesis by Promoting Natural Killer T- and CD4+ T-Cell–Dependent Control of Senescence</title><abstract>Chronic inflammation in the liver provokes fibrosis and, on long-term, carcinogenesis. This sequence is prototypically recapitulated in mice with hepatocyte-specific knock-out of the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), termed NEMOLPC-KO mice, in which increased hepatocyte apoptosis and compensatory regeneration cause steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Natural killer T (NKT) cells carrying the chemokine receptor CXCR6 participate in liver inflammation and injury responses. Here, we investigated the role of CXCR6 in the NEMOLPC-KO mouse model. Unexpectedly, genetic deletion of CXCR6 enhanced hepatocyte death, inflammation and fibrosis in NEMOLPC-KO mice. Although CXCR6 expression is restricted to immune cells in the liver, the adoptive transfer of CXCR6+ cells did not protect NEMOLPC-KOCxcr6-/- mice from hepatic injury. Gene array analyses revealed up-regulated stress response and metabolism pathways in hepatocytes from NEMOLPC-KOCxcr6-/- mice, functionally corresponding to an increased susceptibility of these hepatocytes to TNFα-induced cell death in vitro. These data revealed a novel CXCR6-dependent mechanism of suppressing inflammatory hepatocytic responses to cellular stress.<sep>Critical illness and sepsis are characterized by drastic changes in the systemic innate immune response, particularly involving monocytes. The exact monocyte activation profile during sepsis, however, has remained obscure. Therefore, we prospectively analyzed the gene expression profile of circulating CD14+ monocytes from healthy volunteers (n = 54) and intensive care unit (ICU) patients (n = 76), of which n = 36 had sepsis. RNA sequencing of selected samples revealed that monocytes from septic ICU patients display a peculiar activation pattern, which resembles characteristic functional stages of monocyte-derived macrophages and is distinct from controls or non-sepsis ICU patients. Focusing on 55 highly variable genes selected for further investigation, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP) was highly upregulated in monocytes of ICU patients and only normalized during 7 days in the ICU in non-sepsis patients. Strikingly, low monocytic guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10-like protein (ARHGEF10L) mRNA expression was associated with the disease severity and mortality of ICU patients. Collectively, our comprehensive analysis of circulating monocytes in critically ill patients revealed a distinct activation pattern, particularly in ICU patients with sepsis. The association with disease severity, the longitudinal recovery or lack thereof during the ICU stay, and the association with prognosis indicate the clinical relevance of monocytic gene expression profiles during sepsis.<sep>Abstract Elective cardiac surgery has low procedural complications. However, about 40% of patients develop extracardiac complications including delirium and acute kidney injury. We hypothesized that inflammatory processes and immune cell activation might be associated with these complications. We therefore prospectively included 104 patients undergoing cardiac surgery in our study. We assessed peripheral blood leukocyte populations by flow cytometry and circulating cytokines before operation, after surgery and at days one and four post-operatively. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery showed significantly elevated leukocytes and neutrophils after surgery. On the contrary, monocytes decreased after surgery and significantly increased at days 1 and 4, particularly classical (Mon1,CD14++CD16−) and intermediate (Mon2,CD14++CD16+) monocytes. While peripheral leukocyte subsets were unaltered in patients with infectious (n = 15) or cardiac complications (n = 31), post-operative leukocytes (p = 0.0016), neutrophils (p = 0.0061) and Mon2 (p = 0.0007) were clearly raised in patients developing extracardiac complications (n = 35). Using multiple logistic regression analyses, patient’s age, ICU days, number of blood transfusions and elevated post-surgery Mon2 independently predicted extracardiac complications. Our findings demonstrate that elevated Mon2 after cardiac surgery are associated with an increased risk for extracardiac complications. These findings might improve the risk estimation after cardiac operations and the role of Mon2 for inflammation in cardiac surgery.<sep>Recent evidence suggests that hepatic dendritic cells (HDCs) contribute to the evolution of chronic liver diseases. However, the HDC subsets involved and the mechanisms driving these responses are still poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the role of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 in modulating monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC) differentiation during liver inflammation. The phenotype of HDC and functional relevance of CX3CR1 was assessed in mice following necro-inflammatory liver injury induced by the hepatotoxic agent carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and in steatohepatitis caused by a methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) diet. In both the experimental models, hepatic inflammation was associated with a massive expansion of CD11c+/MHCIIhigh/CD11b+ myeloid HDCs. These cells also expressed the monocyte markers Ly6C, chemokine (C-C Motif) receptor 2 (CCR2), F4/80 and CD88, along with CX3CR1, allowing their tentative identification as moDCs. Mice defective in CX3CR1 showed a reduction in liver-moDC recruitment following CCl4 poisoning in parallel with a defective maturation of monocytes into moDCs. The lack of CX3CR1 also affected moDC differentiation from bone marrow myeloid cells induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in vitro. In wild-type mice, treatment with the CX3CR1 antagonist CX3-AT (150 µg, i.p.) 24 h after CCl4 administration reduced liver moDCS and significantly ameliorated hepatic injury and inflammation. Altogether, these results highlight the possible involvement of moDCs in promoting hepatic inflammation following liver injury and indicated a novel role of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 dyad in driving the differentiation of hepatic moDCs.<sep>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically arises in fibrotic or cirrhotic livers, which are characterized by pathogenic angiogenesis. Myeloid immune cells, specifically tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), may represent potential novel therapeutic targets in HCC, complementing current ablative or immune therapies. However, the detailed functions of TAM subsets in hepatocarcinogenesis have remained obscure.TAM subsets were analyzed in-depth in human HCC samples and a combined fibrosis-HCC mouse model, established by i.p. injection with diethylnitrosamine after birth and repetitive carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment for 16 weeks. Based on comprehensively phenotyping TAM subsets (fluorescence-activated cell sorter, transcriptomics) in mice, the function of CCR2+ TAM was assessed by a pharmacologic chemokine inhibitor. Angiogenesis was evaluated by contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography and histology.We show that human CCR2+ TAM accumulate at the highly vascularized HCC border and express the inflammatory marker S100A9, whereas CD163+ immune-suppressive TAM accrue in the HCC center. In the fibrosis-cancer mouse model, we identified 3 major hepatic myeloid cell populations with distinct messenger RNA profiles, of which CCR2+ TAM particularly showed activated inflammatory and angiogenic pathways. Inhibiting CCR2+ TAM infiltration using a pharmacologic chemokine CCL2 antagonist in the fibrosis-HCC model significantly reduced pathogenic vascularization and hepatic blood volume, alongside attenuated tumor volume.The HCC microenvironment in human patients and mice is characterized by functionally distinct macrophage populations, of which the CCR2+ inflammatory TAM subset has pro-angiogenic properties. Understanding the functional differentiation of myeloid cell subsets in chronically inflamed liver may provide novel opportunities for modulating hepatic macrophages to inhibit tumor-promoting pathogenic angiogenesis.<sep>Background &amp; Aims: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but life-threatening condition, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI), particularly acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity, is the leading cause of ALF. Innate immune mechanisms further perpetuate liver injury, while the role of the adaptive immune system in DILI-related ALF is unclear. Approach &amp; Results: We analyzed liver tissue from two independent patient cohorts with ALF and identified hepatic T cell infiltration as a prominent feature in human ALF. CD8+ T cells were characterised by zonation towards necrotic regions and an activated gene expression signature. In murine APAP-induced liver injury, intravital microscopy revealed zonation of CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells at necrotic areas. Gene expression analysis exposed upregulated C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and its ligand CCL21 in liver as well as a broadly activated phenotype of hepatic CD8+ T cells. In two mouse models of ALF, Ccr7 -/- mice had significantly aggravated early-phase liver damage. Functionally, CCR7 was not involved in the recruitment of CD8+ T cells, but regulated their activation profile potentially via egress to lymphatics. Ccr7 -/- CD8+ T cells were characterized by elevated expression of activation, effector, and exhaustion profiles. Adoptive transfer revealed preferential homing of CCR7-deficient CD8+ T cells to the liver, and depletion of CD8+ T cells attenuated liver damage in mice. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates an involvement of the adaptive immune system in ALF in humans and mice. We identify the CCR7-CCL21 axis as an important regulatory pathway, providing downstream protection against T cell-mediated liver injury.<sep>Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by rapid clinical deterioration and high mortality. Acetaminophen (APAP or paracetamol) overdose is a leading cause of ALF, resulting in hepatocellular necrosis with subsequent inflammation, inflicting further liver damage. Infiltrating myeloid cells are early drivers of liver inflammation. However, the role of the abundant population of liver-resident innate lymphocytes, which commonly express the chemokine receptor CXCR6, is incompletely understood in ALF.We investigated the role of CXCR6-expressing innate lymphocytes using the model of acute APAP toxicity in mice deficient in CXCR6 (Cxcr6gfp/gfp).APAP-induced liver injury was strongly aggravated in Cxcr6gfp/gfp mice compared with wild-type counterparts. Immunophenotyping using flow cytometry revealed a reduction in liver CD4+T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and most prominently, NKT cells, whereas CXCR6 was dispensable for CD8+ T-cell accumulation. CXCR6-deficient mice exhibited excessive neutrophil and inflammatory macrophage infiltration. Intravital microscopy revealed dense cellular clusters of neutrophils in necrotic liver tissue, with higher numbers of clustering neutrophils in Cxcr6gfp/gfp mice. Gene expression analysis linked hyperinflammation in CXCR6 deficiency to increased IL-17 signaling. Although reduced in overall numbers, CXCR6-deficient mice had a shift in NKT cell subsets with increased RORγt-expressing NKT17 cells as a likely source of IL-17. In patients with ALF, we found a prominent accumulation of IL-17-expressing cells. Accordingly, CXCR6-deficient mice lacking IL-17 (Cxcr6gfp/gfpx Il17-/-) had ameliorated liver damage and reduced inflammatory myeloid infiltrates.Our study identifies a crucial role of CXCR6-expressing liver innate lymphocytes as orchestrators in acute liver injury containing IL-17-mediated myeloid cell infiltration. Hence, strengthening the CXCR6-axis or downstream inhibition of IL-17 could yield novel therapeutics in ALF.<sep>Inflammation in the liver provokes fibrosis, but inflammation is also important for tumor surveillance. Inhibitors of chemokine pathways, such as CXCL16 and CXCR6 regulation of lymphocyte trafficking, are being tested as antifibrotic agents, but their effects on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unclear. We assessed the roles of CXCR6-dependent immune mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis.C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice and CXCR6-deficient mice (Cxcr6eGfp/eGfp) were given injections of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce liver cancer and α-galactosylceramide to activate natural killer T (NKT) cells. We also performed studies in mice with conditional, hepatocyte-specific deletion of NEMO, which develop inflammation-associated liver tumors (NemoLPC-KO and NemoLPC-KOCxcr6eGfp/eGfp mice). We collected liver tissues from patients with cirrhosis (n = 43), HCC (n = 35), and neither of these diseases (control individuals, n = 25). Human and mouse liver tissues were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, RNA expression arrays (from sorted hepatic lymphocytes), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging. Bone marrow was transferred from Cxcr6eGfp/eGfp or WT mice to irradiated C57BL/6J mice, and spleen and liver cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. CD4+ T cells or NKT cells were isolated from the spleen and liver of CD45.1+ WT mice and transferred into CXCR6-deficient mice after DEN injection.After DEN injection, CXCR6-deficient mice had a significantly higher tumor burden than WT mice and increased tumor progression, characterized by reduced intrahepatic numbers of invariant NKT and CD4+ T cells that express tumor necrosis factor and interferon gamma. Livers of NemoLPC-KOCxcr6eGfp/eGfp mice had significantly more senescent hepatocytes than livers of NemoLPC-KO mice. In studies of bone-marrow chimeras, adoptive cell transfer experiments, and analyses of NemoLPC-KO mice, we found that NKT and CD4 T cells promote the removal of senescent hepatocytes to prevent hepatocarcinogenesis, and that this process required CXCR6. Injection of WT with α-galactosylceramide increased removal of senescent hepatocytes by NKT cells. We observed peritumoral accumulation of CXCR6-associated lymphocytes in human HCC, which appeared reduced compared with cirrhosis tissues.In studies of mice with liver tumors, we found that CXCR6 mediated NKT-cell and CD4+ T-cell removal of senescent hepatocytes. Antifibrotic strategies to reduce CXCR6 activity in liver, or to reduce inflammation or modulate the immune response, should be tested for their effects on hepatocarcinogenesis.</abstract>", "<keyword>Tumor microenvironment<sep>Heteronuclear molecule<sep>Histidine<sep>Tropism<sep>Cancer cell<sep>Tissue tropism<sep>Coronavirus<sep>Relaxation (psychology)<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>Multicellular organism<sep>Tumor cells<sep>Compartmentalization (fire protection)<sep>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<sep>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy<sep>Glioblastoma<sep>Pannexin<sep>Furin<sep>Viral replication<sep>Side chain<sep>Endocytosis</keyword><title>Tunneling nanotubes, TNT, communicate glioblastoma with surrounding non-tumor astrocytes to adapt them to hypoxic and metabolic tumor conditions<sep>Mobility of Histidine Side Chains Analyzed with <sup>15</sup>N NMR Relaxation and Cross-Correlation Data: Insight into Zinc-Finger–DNA Interactions<sep>Pannexin-1 channel opening is critical for COVID-19 pathogenesis<sep>Role of Tunneling Nanotube–like Structures during the Early Events of HIV Infection: Novel Features of Tissue Compartmentalization and Mechanism of HIV Spread</title><abstract>Cell-to-cell communication is essential for the development and proper function of multicellular systems. We and others demonstrated that tunneling nanotubes (TNT) proliferate in several pathological conditions such as HIV, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the nature, function, and contribution of TNT to cancer pathogenesis are poorly understood. Our analyses demonstrate that TNT structures are induced between glioblastoma (GBM) cells and surrounding non-tumor astrocytes to transfer tumor-derived mitochondria. The mitochondrial transfer mediated by TNT resulted in the adaptation of non-tumor astrocytes to tumor-like metabolism and hypoxia conditions. In conclusion, TNT are an efficient cell-to-cell communication system used by cancer cells to adapt the microenvironment to the invasive nature of the tumor.<sep>Due to chemical exchange, the mobility of histidine (His) side chains of proteins is typically difficult to analyze by NMR spectroscopy. Using an NMR approach that is uninfluenced by chemical exchange, we investigated internal motions of the His imidazole NH groups that directly interact with DNA phosphates in the Egr-1 zinc-finger–DNA complex. In this approach, the transverse and longitudinal cross-correlation rates for 15N chemical shift anisotropy and 15N–1H dipole–dipole relaxation interference were analyzed together with 15N longitudinal relaxation rates and heteronuclear Overhauser effect data at two magnetic field strengths. We found that the zinc-coordinating His side chains directly interacting with DNA phosphates are strongly restricted in mobility. This makes a contrast to the arginine and lysine side chains that retain high mobility despite their interactions with DNA phosphates in the same complex. The entropic effects of side-chain mobility on the molecular association are discussed.<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly rampaged worldwide, causing a pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID -19), but the biology of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation. We demonstrate that both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E) or its purified S protein, one of the main viruses responsible for the common cold, induce the transient opening of Pannexin-1 (Panx-1) channels in human lung epithelial cells. However, the Panx-1 channel opening induced by SARS-CoV-2 is greater and more prolonged than hCoV-229E/S protein, resulting in an enhanced ATP, PGE2, and IL-1β release. Analysis of lung lavages and tissues indicate that Panx-1 mRNA expression is associated with increased ATP, PGE2, and IL-1β levels. Panx-1 channel opening induced by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), endocytosis, and furin dependent. Overall, we demonstrated that Panx-1 channel is a critical contributor to SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be considered as an alternative therapy.<sep>HIV has become a chronic disease despite the effective use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the mechanisms of tissue colonization, viral evolution, generation of viral reservoirs, and compartmentalization are still a matter of debate due to the challenges involved in examining early events of infection at the cellular and molecular level. Thus, there is still an urgent need to explore these areas to develop effective HIV cure strategies. In this study, we describe the early events of tissue colonization and compartmentalization as well as the role of tunneling nanotube-like structures during viral spread in the presence and absence of effective antiretroviral treatment. To examine these mechanisms, NOD/SCID IL-2 RG-/- humanized mice were either directly infected with HIVADA or with low numbers of HIVADA-infected leukocytes to limit tissue colonization in the presence and absence of TAK779, an effective CCR5 blocker of HIV entry. We identify that viral seeding in tissues occurs early in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner (24-72 h). Reduction in systemic HIV replication by TAK779 treatment did not affect tissue seeding or spreading, despite reduced systemic viral replication. Tissue-associated HIV-infected cells had different properties than cells in the circulation because the virus continues to spread in tissues in a tunneling nanotube-like structure-dependent manner, despite ART. Thus, understanding these mechanisms can provide new approaches to enhance the efficacy of existing ART and HIV infection cure strategies.</abstract>", "<keyword>Resolution (logic)<sep>Hippocampal

astrocyte processes. Therefore, the substantial variability of astrocyte coverage of individual hippocampal synapses implies that the efficacy of local glutamate uptake and thus the spatial fidelity of synaptic transmission is synapse dependent. By visualization of sub-diffraction-limit perisynaptic astrocytic processes and adjacent postsynaptic spines, we show that, relative to their size, small spines display a stronger coverage by astroglial transporters than bigger neighboring spines. Similarly, glutamate transients evoked by synaptic stimulation are more sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of glutamate uptake at smaller spines, whose high-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are better shielded from remotely<sep>The goal of understanding the architecture of neural circuits at the synapse level with a brain-wide perspective has powered the interest in high-speed and large field-of-view volumetric imaging at subcellular resolution. Here, we developed a method combining tissue expansion and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to allow extended volumetric super resolution high-speed imaging of large mouse brain samples. We demonstrate the capabilities of this method by performing two color fast volumetric super resolution imaging of mouse CA1 and dentate gyrus molecular-, granule cell-, and polymorphic layers. Our method enables an exact evaluation of granule cell and neurite morphology within the context of large cell ensembles spanning<sep>Extrasynaptic actions of glutamate are limited by high-affinity transporters on perisynaptic astroglial processes (PAPs), which helps to maintain point-to-point transmission in excitatory circuits. Memory formation in the brain is associated with synaptic remodelling, but how this remodelling affects PAPs and therefore extrasynaptic glutamate actions is poorly understood. Here we used advanced imaging methods, in situ and in vivo, to find that a classical synaptic memory mechanism, long-term potentiation (LTP), triggers withdrawal of PAPs from potentiated synapses.

The underlying cellular machinery is thought to rely on astrocytic Ca2+ signals, but what controls their amplitude and waveform is poorly understood. Here, we employ time-resolved two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging in acute hippocampal slices and in cortex in vivo to find that resting [Ca2+] predicts the scale (amplitude) and the maximum (peak) of astroglial Ca2+ elevations. We bidirectionally manipulate resting [Ca2+] by uncaging intracellular Ca2+ or Ca2+ buffers and use ratiometric imaging of a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator to establish that alterations in resting [Ca2+] change co-directionally the peak level and anti-directionally the<sep>Abstract The biological significance of a small supernumerary marker chromosome that results in dosage alterations to chromosome 9p24.1, including triplication of the GLDC gene encoding glycine decarboxylase, in two patients with psychosis is unclear. In an allelic series of copy number variant mouse models, we identify that triplication of Gldc reduces extracellular glycine levels as determined by optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in dentate gyrus (DG) but not in CA1, suppresses long-term potentiation (LTP) in mPP-DG synapses but not in CA3-CA1 synapses, reduces the activity of biochemical pathways implicated in schizophrenia and mitochondrial bioenergetics, and displays deficits in prepulse inhibition, startle habituation, latent<sep>Summary Astroglia constrain extrasynaptic escape of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, thus controlling synaptic signal integration in cortical circuits, which ultimately influences cognitive function. Memory formation is associated with synaptic remodeling but how the latter affects perisynaptic astroglia and thus extrasynaptic glutamate actions remains unknown. We used light diffraction-insensitive microscopy methods to find that a classical synaptic memory event, long-term potentiation (LTP), ex vivo and in vivo, at multiple or individual connections, triggers sub-microscopic withdrawal of astroglia from potentiated synapses. Molecular localization super-resolution imaging and optical glutamate sensors combined with patch-clamp reveal that LTP induction prompts spatial retreat of glial glutamate transporters, boosting glutamate spillover<sep>Dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells amplify clustered glutamatergic input by activation of voltage-gated sodium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). NMDAR activity depends on the presence of NMDAR co-agonists such as D-serine, but how co-agonists influence dendritic integration is not well understood. Using combinations of whole-cell patch clamp, iontophoretic glutamate application, two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy and glutamate uncaging in acute rat and mouse brain slices we found that exogenous D-serine reduced the threshold of dendritic spikes and increased their amplitude. Triggering an astrocytic mechanism controlling endogenous D-serine supply via endocannabinoid receptors (CBRs) also increased dendritic spiking. Unexpectedly, this pathway was activated by pyramidal cell<sep>Solute-binding proteins (SBPs) have evolved to balance the demands of ligand affinity, thermostability, and conformational change to accomplish diverse functions in small molecule transport, sensing, and chemotaxis. Although the ligand-induced conformational changes that occur in SBPs make them useful components in biosensors, they are challenging targets for protein engineering and design. Here, we have engineered a d-alanine-specific SBP into a fluorescence biosensor with specificity for the signaling molecule d-serine (D-serFS). This was achieved through binding site and remote mutations that improved affinity (KD = 6.7 ± 0.5 μM), specificity (40-fold increase vs glycine), thermostability (Tm = 79 °C), and dynamic range (∼14%). This sensor<sep>Abstract Astrocytes play a dual role in the brain. On the one hand, they are active signaling partners of neurons and can for instance control synaptic transmission and its plasticity. On the other hand, they fulfill various homeostatic functions such as clearance of glutamate and K + released from neurons. The latter is for instance important for limiting neuronal excitability. Therefore, an impairment or failure of glutamate and K + clearance will lead to increased neuronal excitability, which could trigger or aggravate brain diseases such as epilepsy, in which neuronal hyperexcitability plays a role. Experimental data indicate that astrocytes could have such a causal<sep>Summary Solute-binding proteins (SBPs) have evolved to balance the demands of ligand affinity, thermostability and conformational change to accomplish diverse functions in small molecule transport, sensing and chemotaxis.

They rely on multiple mechanisms including the processing of sensory information, memory formation, maintenance of short- and long-term memory, memory retrieval and memory extinction. Recent experiments provide strong evidence that, besides neurons, astrocytes crucially contribute to these higher brain functions. However, the complex interplay of astrocytes and neurons in local neuron-glia assemblies is far from being understood. Although important basic cellular principles that govern and link neuronal and astrocytic cellular functions have been established, additional mechanisms clearly continue to emerge. In this short essay, we first review current technologies allowing the experimenter<sep>Abstract Astrocytes have long been considered to be a largely homogeneous cell population. Recent studies however suggest that astrocytes are highly adapted to the local neuronal circuitry. Glucose utilization in the retinorecipient superior colliculus (SC) is one of the highest in the brain. Since metabolic support to neurons is a major function of astrocytes, they could be of particular relevance in this region and display specific features. However, little is known about astrocytes and their interactions with neurons in this multisensory brain area. We thus here investigated region-specific cellular and structural properties of astrocytes in the visual layer of the SC. Using morphological reconstructions,<sep>Abstract NG2 glia represent a distinct type of macroglial cells in the CNS and are unique among glia because they receive synaptic input from neurons. They are abundantly present in white and grey matter. While the majority of white matter NG2 glia differentiates into oligodendrocytes, the physiological impact of grey matter NG2 glia and their synaptic input are ill defined yet. Here we asked whether dysfunctional NG2 glia affect neuronal signaling and behavior. We generated mice with inducible deletion of the K + channel Kir4.1 in NG2 glia and performed comparative electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, molecular and behavioral analyses. Focussing on the hippocampus, we found that<sep>Astrocytes are an important component of the multipartite synapse and crucial for proper neuronal network function. Although small GTPases of the Rho family are powerful regulators of cellular morphology, the signaling modules of Rho-mediated pathways in astrocytes remain enigmatic. Here we demonstrated that the serotonin receptor 4 (5-HT4 R) is expressed in hippocampal astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. Through fluorescence microscopy, we established that 5-HT4 R activation triggered RhoA activity via Gα13 -mediated signaling, which boosted filamentous actin assembly, leading to morphological changes in hippocampal astrocytes. We investigated the effects of these 5-HT4 R-mediated changes in mixed cultures and in acute slices,<sep>Abstract Memory deficits are a debilitating symptom of epilepsy, but little is known about mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits. Here, we describe a Na+ channel-dependent mechanism underlying altered hippocampal dendritic integration, degraded place coding and deficits in spatial memory. Two-photon glutamate uncaging experiments revealed a marked increase in the fraction of hippocampal first-order CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites capable of generating dendritic spikes in the kainate model of chronic epilepsy. Moreover, in epileptic mice dendritic spikes were generated with lower input synchrony, and with a lower threshold. The Nav1.3/1.1 selective Na+ channel blocker ICA-121431 reversed dendritic hyperexcitability in epileptic mice, while the Nav1.2/1.6 preferring anticonvulsant S-Lic<sep>Abstract Astrocytes form large networks, in which individual cells are connected via gap junctions. It is thought that this astroglial gap junction coupling contributes to the buffering of extracellular K + increases. However, it is largely unknown how the control of extracellular K + by astroglial gap junction coupling depends on the underlying activity patterns and on the magnitude of extracellular K + increases. We explored this dependency in acute hippocampal slices (CA1, stratum radiatum) by direct K + ‐sensitive microelectrode recordings and acute pharmacological inhibition of gap junctions. K + transients evoked by synaptic and axonal activity were largely unaffected by acute astroglial<sep>Abstract Astrocytes play a key role in the regulation of synaptic strength and are thought to orchestrate synaptic plasticity and memory. Yet, how specifically astrocytes and their neuroactive transmitters control learning and memory is currently an open question. Recent experiments have uncovered an astrocyte-mediated feedback loop in CA1 pyramidal neurons which is started by the release of endocannabinoids by active neurons and closed by astrocytic regulation of the D-serine levels at the dendrites. D-serine is a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor regulating the strength and direction of synaptic plasticity. Activity-dependent D-serine release mediated by astrocytes is therefore a candidate for mediating between long-term synaptic<sep>Abstract Astrocytes are integral components of brain circuits, where they sense, process, and respond to surrounding activity, maintaining homeostasis and regulating synaptic transmission, the sum of which results in behavior modulation. These interactions are possible due to their complex morphology, composed of a tree‐like structure of processes to cover defined territories ramifying in a mesh‐like system of fine leaflets unresolved by conventional optic microscopy. While recent reports devoted more attention to leaflets and their dynamic interactions with synapses, our knowledge about the tree‐like “backbone” structure in physiological conditions is incomplete. Recent transcriptomic studies described astrocyte molecular diversity, suggesting structural heterogeneity in regions such as<sep>We aim to characterize the causality and molecular and functional underpinnings of HACE1 deficiency in a mouse model of a recessive neurodevelopmental syndrome called spastic paraplegia and psychomotor retardation with or without seizures (SPPRS).By exome sequencing, we identified 2 novel homozygous truncating mutations in HACE1 in 3 patients from 2 families, p.Q209* and p.R332*. Furthermore, we performed detailed molecular and phenotypic analyses of Hace1 knock-out (KO) mice and SPPRS patient fibroblasts.We show that Hace1 KO mice display many clinical features of SPPRS including enlarged ventricles, hypoplastic corpus callosum, as well as locomotion and learning deficiencies. Mechanistically, loss of HACE1 results in altered levels and<sep>The concept of the tripartite synapse describes the close interaction of pre- and postsynaptic elements and the surrounding astrocyte processes. For glutamatergic synapses, it is established that the presence of astrocytic processes and their structural arrangements varies considerably between and within brain regions and between synapses of the same neuron. In contrast, less is known about the organization of astrocytic processes at GABAergic synapses although bi-directional signaling is known to exist at these synapses too. Therefore, we established super-resolution expansion microscopy of GABAergic synapses and nearby astrocytic processes in the stratum radiatum of the mouse hippocampal CA1 region. By visualizing the presynaptic vesicular GABA<sep>Abstract Fast synaptic communication uses diffusible transmitters whose spread is limited by uptake mechanisms. However, on the submicron-scale, the distance between two synapses, the extent of glutamate spread has so far remained difficult to measure.

The uncaging-induced remote activation of AMPA-Rs was facilitated by blocking glutamate<sep>Recent achievements in indicator optimization and imaging techniques promote the advancement of functional imaging to decipher complex signaling processes in living cells, such as Ca2+ activity patterns. Astrocytes are important regulators of the brain network and well known for their highly complex morphology and spontaneous Ca2+ activity. However, the astrocyte community is lacking standardized methods to analyze and interpret Ca2+ activity recordings, hindering global comparisons. Here, we present a biophysically-based analytical concept for deciphering the complex spatio-temporal changes of Ca2+ biosensor fluorescence for understanding the underlying signaling mechanisms.

Kir4.1 was deleted at postnatal day 23–26<sep>The fine processes of single astrocytes can contact many thousands of synapses whose function they can modulate through bi-directional signaling. The spatial arrangement of astrocytic processes and neuronal structures is relevant for such interactions and for the support of neuronal signaling by astrocytes. At the same time, the geometry of perisynaptic astrocyte processes is variable and dynamically regulated. Studying these fine astrocyte processes represents a technical challenge, because many of them cannot be fully resolved by diffraction-limited microscopy. Therefore, we have established two indirect parameters of astrocyte morphology, which, while not fully resolving local geometry by design, provide statistical measures of astrocyte morphology: the<sep>High-affinity, Na + -dependent glutamate transporters are the primary means by which synaptically released glutamate is removed from the extracellular space. They restrict the spread of glutamate from the synaptic cleft into the perisynaptic space and reduce its spillover to neighboring synapses. Thereby, glutamate uptake increases the spatial precision of synaptic communication. Its dysfunction and the entailing rise of the extracellular glutamate concentration accompanied by an increased spread of glutamate result in a loss of precision and in enhanced excitation, which can eventually lead to neuronal death via excitotoxicity. Efficient glutamate uptake depends on a negative resting membrane potential as well as on the<sep>Structural changes of astrocytes and their perisynaptic processes occur in response to various physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. They are thought to profoundly affect synaptic signalling and neuron-astrocyte communication. Understanding the causal relationship between astrocyte morphology changes and their functional consequences requires experimental tools to selectively manipulate astrocyte morphology. Previous studies indicate that RhoA-related signalling can play a major role in controlling astrocyte morphology, but the direct effect of increased RhoA activity has not been documented in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we established a viral approach to manipulate astrocytic RhoA activity. We tested if and how overexpression of wild-type RhoA, of a constitutively active<sep>Long-term modifications of astrocyte function and morphology are well known to occur in epilepsy. They are implicated in the development and manifestation of the disease, but the relevant mechanisms and their pathophysiological role are not firmly established. For instance, it is unclear how quickly the onset of epileptic activity triggers astrocyte morphology changes and what the relevant molecular signals are. We therefore used two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy to monitor astrocyte morphology in parallel to the induction of epileptiform activity. We uncovered astrocyte morphology changes within 10-20 min under various experimental conditions in acute hippocampal slices. In vivo, induction of status epilepticus resulted in similarly<sep>Abstract Recent achievements in indicator optimization and imaging techniques promote the exploration of Ca 2+ activity patterns as a main second messenger in many organs. Astrocytes are important regulators of brain activity and well known for their Ca 2+ -dependent modulation of neurons. However, standardized methods to analyze and interpret Ca 2+ activity recordings are missing and hindering global comparisons. Here, we present a biophysics-based concept to analyze Ca 2+ signals, which includes multiple thresholds and provides the experimenter with a comprehensive toolbox for a differentiated and in-depth characterization of Ca 2+ signals. We analyzed various ex vivo and in vivo imaging datasets and<sep>Abstract The wiring scheme of neurons is key to the function of the brain.

In the developing cerebellum and somatosensory cortex the GABAergic input might regulate NG2 glia differentiation and myelination, and a switch from synaptic to extrasynaptic neuron-glia signaling was reported in the latter region. Myelination in the hippocampus is sparse, and most NG2 glia retain their phenotype throughout adulthood, raising the question of the properties and function of neuron-NG2 glia synapses in that brain region. Here, we compared spontaneous and evoked GABAA receptor-mediated currents of NG2 glia in juvenile and adult hippocampi of mice of either sex<sep>Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are an invaluable tool in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging.

Intensity-based approaches, however, are prone to artifacts introduced by changes in fluorophore concentrations. This drawback can be overcome by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) based on time-correlated single-photon counting. FLIM often necessitates long photon collection times, resulting in strong temporal binning of dynamic processes. Recently, rapidFLIM was introduced, exploiting ultra-low dead-time photodetectors together with rapid electronics.

Tunnelling spectroscopy is used to measure the evolution of subgap states while varying magnetic field and voltages applied to various nearby gates. At magnetic fields between 0.7 and 0.9 T, the differential conductance contains large zero bias peaks (ZBPs) whose height reaches values on the order 2e2/h. We investigate these ZBPs for large ranges of gate voltages in different devices. We discuss possible interpretations in terms of disorder-induced subgap states, Andreev bound states and Majorana zero modes.<sep>Abstract Strong spin–orbit semiconductor nanowires coupled to a superconductor are predicted to host Majorana zero modes. Exchange (braiding) operations of Majorana modes form the logical gates of a topological quantum computer and require a network of nanowires. Here, we utilize an in-plane selective area growth technique for InSb–Al semiconductor–superconductor nanowire networks. Transport channels, free from extended defects, in InSb nanowire networks are realized on insulating, but heavily mismatched InP (111)B substrates by full relaxation of the lattice mismatch at the nanowire/substrate interface and nucleation of a complete network from a single nucleation site by optimizing the surface diffusion length of the adatoms. Essential quantum transport phenomena for topological quantum computing are demonstrated in these structures including phase-coherence lengths exceeding several micrometers with Aharonov–Bohm oscillations up to five harmonics and a hard superconducting gap accompanied by 2 e -periodic Coulomb oscillations with an Al-based Cooper pair island integrated in the nanowire network.<sep>Electronic excitations above the ground state must overcome an energy gap in superconductors with spatially-homogeneous s-wave pairing. In contrast, inhomogeneous superconductors such as those with magnetic impurities or weak links, or heterojunctions containing normal metals or quantum dots, can host subgap electronic excitations that are generically known as Andreev bound states (ABSs). With the advent of topological superconductivity, a new kind of ABS with exotic qualities, known as Majorana bound state (MBS), has been discovered. We review the main properties of ABSs and MBSs, and the state-of-the-art techniques for their detection. We focus on hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, possibly coupled to quantum dots, as one of the most flexible and promising experimental platforms. We discuss how the combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field in these wires triggers the transition from ABSs into MBSs. We show theoretical progress beyond minimal models in understanding experiments, including the possibility of different types of robust zero modes that may emerge without a band-topological transition. We examine the role of spatial non-locality, a special property of MBS wavefunctions that, together with non-Abelian braiding, is the key to realizing topological quantum computation.<sep>Quantum technology is a promising area of research, with the quantum computer as the prime example. Quantum computers can perform calculations thought to be impossible by conventional means. The fundamental building block of a quantum computer is a qubit, which is a quantumsystem which can be used to process and store quantuminformation. Most qubits can hold on to this quantuminformation for only a short period of time due to environmental noise. The resulting errors can be mitigated by storing the information in multiple qubits. An alternative approach uses qubits which are insensitive to noise. This can be achieved by using topological quantumstates. An example of a topological quantum state is the Majorana zero mode. Majorana zero modes can be realized in a 1D system with strong spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity, in an external magnetic field. Such materials are not known in nature, but can be engineered by coupling a semiconductor nanowire to a superconducting material. To use these Majorana zero modes as qubits, multiple nanowires have to be connected to each other in a 2D network. The experiments described in this thesis aim to develop such networks based on InSb (indium antimonide) semiconductor nanowires. A few necessary theoretical concepts are briefly introduced. Subsequently, the nanofabrication and electrical measurement techniques used to study the nanowires are described, with emphasis on the challenges related to working with hybrid semiconductorsuperconductor (InSb-Al)materials. Two methods are then presented to realize nanowire networks. Transport experiments on these networks show strong phase coherence and a hard superconducting gap, demonstrating the high quality of the material. In addition to the intrinsic quality of the material, the electrostatic environment plays an important role for the functionality of hybrid materials. The coupling between the superconductor (Al) and the semiconductor (InSb) is studied by applying an external electric field. This electric field influences material properties such as the spin-orbit coupling and the Lande g -factor. An essential property of the Majorana zero modes is the fact that their state cannot be described locally. Exploratory experiments with the aim of demonstrating this non-locality are described, followed by theoretical simulations demonstrating the limitations of common experimental practice based on local measurements. Finally, several suggestions for future experiments are made, aimed at demonstrating and manipulatingMajorana zero modes.</abstract>", "<keyword>Focus (optics)<sep>Multinational corporation<sep>Emerging markets<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Urbanity<sep>Foreign direct investment<sep>Marketing buzz<sep>Investment (military)<sep>Tacit knowledge<sep>Sophistication<sep>Globalization</keyword><title>Business districts: the spatial characteristics of FDI within cities<sep>Undercurrents in the world economy: Evolving global investment flows in the South<sep>Uneven ties!

The results revealed the spatial indicators that attract FDI in knowledge-intensive industrial activities.<sep>Abstract Foreign direct investment (FDI) to the global South has increased, but very little research has gone into analysing the diverse FDI flows between unequally related groups of countries. This paper contributes by investigating (a) the distribution of global FDI into and between semi‐peripheral and peripheral countries in the global South (2006–2014), and (b) the country location factors of FDI in these two regions. We introduce a distinction between multinational enterprises from emerging (EMNE) and from peripheral countries (PMNE) and show evidence of their different investment behaviour. Our results uniquely demonstrate intra‐regional investment differences, the increasing sophistication of peripheries as hosts and sources of FDI (developmental undercurrents) and a rich set of location factors explaining FDI into these regions. We also show that EMNEs invest in semi‐peripheral countries so as to benefit from their emerging capacity to innovate.<sep>Notwithstanding the fast globalizing world we live in, academics and policymakers continue to view economic geography as a science of particularly urban and sometimes regional scales (Grabher 2006). This has led to an over-territorialized notion of development (Dicken and Malmberg 2001; Hess 2004; Crescenzi et al. 2016). Within our contemporary context, a need for the smart coupling of regional assets to global production networks, across geographic scales, is evident (Henderson et al. 2002; Coe et al. 2004; Hess 2004). This type of approach is important when considering that globalization can be characterized by the integration of international labor markets, capital markets and commodity markets (Bordo et al. 2005), through which corporations intensify their networks globally, in their pursuit of profit maximization, and driven by natural and human resource scarcity (Maddison 1995). Combined expansion and integration has enabled the increased development of international networks and the splintering of markets and production across various spatial scales (Dicken 2003; Taylor 2004; Alderson and Beckfield 2004; Wall 2009). Urban and regional economic development does not depend particularly on local production and knowledge characteristics, but instead requires ‘global pipelines’ (Bathelt et al. 2004), and ‘local buzz’ (Storper and Venables 2004). The emergence of these linkages does not necessarily depend on geographic proximity (Alderson and Beckfield 2004; Boschma 2005; Wall and van der Knaap 2011), and where attributes that are non-spatial, such as cognitive, organizational, institutional and social, play a critical role in the formation of corporate networks (D’Este et al. 2013).</abstract>", "<keyword>Socioeconomic status<sep>Outsourcing<sep>Social distance<sep>Economic impact analysis<sep>Threat model<sep>Shutdown<sep>Homeland security<sep>Operability<sep>Domain (mathematical analysis)<sep>Productivity<sep>Heart failure<sep>Risk management<sep>Field (mathematics)<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>Adversary<sep>Psychological intervention<sep>Economic sector<sep>Vulnerability (computing)<sep>Psychological resilience<sep>Critical infrastructure protection<sep>Pandemic<sep>Shut down<sep>Architecture<sep>Interdependence<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Prioritization<sep>Preparedness<sep>Vulnerability assessment<sep>Timeline<sep>Phone<sep>Air quality index<sep>Function (biology)<sep>Hospital readmission<sep>Shock (circulatory)<sep>Health care<sep>Workforce<sep>Containment (computer programming)<sep>Electric power<sep>Risk assessment<sep>Baseline (sea)<sep>Critical infrastructure<sep>Terrorism<sep>Resilience (materials science)<sep>Real estate<sep>Metropolitan area<sep>Recreation<sep>Flow network<sep>Medicaid<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Extreme weather<sep>Production (economics)<sep>Interdependent networks</keyword><title>An Input-Output Model to Determine the Operability and Economic Impacts of IT on Interdependent Industries<sep>Reflections on the impact of “flatten the curve” on interdependent workforce sectors<sep>The Economic Impact of Lockdowns: A Persistent Inoperability Input-Output Approach<sep>Inoperability Input–Output Modeling of Electric Power Disruptions<sep>Assessing the economic ripple effects of critical infrastructure failures using the dynamic inoperability input-output model: a case study of the Taal Volcano eruption<sep>Risk Analysis Framework for Cyber Security and Critical Infrastructure Protection of the US Electric Power Grid<sep>A Risk Analysis Framework for Cyber Security and Critical Infrastructure Protection of the U.S. Electric Power Grid<sep>The Impact of “Flatten the Curve” on Interdependent Economic Sectors<sep>Uncertainty Analysis of Business Interruption Losses in the Philippines Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic<sep>Managing Physical and Economic Risk for Systems with Multidirectional Network Interdependencies<sep>Using input-output analysis to model the impact of pandemic mitigation and suppression measures on the workforce<sep>Epidemiological and economic impact of COVID-19 in the US<sep>Decision Support Tool to Estimate and Reduce the Probability of Readmission for Congestive Heart Failure Patients<sep>Extreme Weather Events and the Performance of Critical Utility Infrastructures: A Case Study of Hurricane Harvey<sep>Disaster risk and artificial intelligence: A framework to characterize conceptual synergies and future opportunities<sep>Managing Cybersecurity Risk Using Threat Based Methodology for Evaluation of Cybersecurity Architectures<sep>Spatio-Temporal Drought Risk Analysis Using GIS-Based Input Output Modeling<sep>Threat Modeling for Enterprise Cybersecurity Architecture<sep>Pandemic wave trends in COVID-19 cases, mobility reduction, and climate parameters in major metropolitan areas in the United States<sep>Modeling regional impacts and resilience to water service disruptions in urban economies</title><abstract>Disasters, such as hurricanes and terrorist attacks, are damaging to various critical infrastructure systems. They disrupt supply chains and have adverse effects on the productivity of economic sectors. The IT sector is a highly vulnerable and critical infrastructure in the United States. This sector is susceptible to various forms of malicious attacks. Previous publications focus on security shortfalls existing within the IT system architecture and organizational policy. This paper asserts the need for a broader exploration of IT security as a macroeconomic system engineering problem. In this paper, we conducted a study to evaluate the inoperability impact and economic losses experienced by various industries due to a direct attack on the IT sector.<sep>The expression \"flatten the curve\" has gained significant attention in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The idea is to decrease and/or delay the peak of an epidemic wave so as not to strain or exceed the capacity of healthcare systems. There has been an increasing number of policy recommendations across the globe that favor the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to flatten the curve. NPIs encompass containment, suppression, and mitigation measures such as quarantine, travel restrictions, and business closures. This paper provides perspectives on the impact of containment, suppression, and mitigation measures on interdependent workforce sectors. Reflections on the trade-offs between flattening the curve versus personal liberty and socioeconomic disparities are also presented in this paper.<sep>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments around the world to implement unprecedented lockdowns, mandating businesses to shut down for extended periods of time. Previous studies have modeled the impact of disruptions to the economy at static and dynamic settings. This study develops a model to fulfil the need to account for the sustained disruption resulting from the extended shutdown of business operations. Using a persistent inoperability input-output model (PIIM), we are able to show that (1) sectors that suffer higher levels of inoperability during quarantine period may recover faster depending on their resilience; (2) initially unaffected sectors can suffer inoperability levels higher than directly affected sectors over time; (3) the economic impact on other regions not under lockdown is also significant.<sep>This chapter presents a framework for assessing the impact of electric power disruptions on interdependent sectors of the economy. We use two primary metrics for the impact assessment: (i) economic loss, which measures the financial impact of electric power disruptions on multiple sectors of the economy, and (ii) inoperability, which measures the proportional extent in which each sector is affected relative to its ideal production output. The approach utilizes an extension to the input–output (IO) model, which is capable of accounting the degree of interdependencies across various sectors of the economy based on their supply and demand transactions. We present a case study to demonstrate how the inoperability IO model can be used to analyze electric power disruption scenarios and to subsequently prioritize the sectors using the aforementioned impact metrics.<sep>Critical infrastructure systems are essential in sustaining people’s livelihoods and the operation of economic sectors. In this paper, we extend the dynamic inoperability IO model (DIIM), we evaluate the resilience of economic sectors given the initial functionality loss and recovery time of an infrastructure. The resulting model is applied in a case study of the 2020 eruption of Taal Volcano in the Philippines. The initial inoperability and recovery period parameters are used in the 14-sector DIIM. The dynamic recovery behaviors of the sectors are plotted over the disaster timeline based on two metrics: (1) economic loss, which is the monetary value of the damage; and (2) inoperability, which is the dimensionless loss relative to the total production output of each sector. The DIIM template and case study results from this paper can provide policy insights to enhance disaster resilience planning for future disasters.<sep>The purpose of this article is to introduce a risk analysis framework to enhance the cyber security of and to protect the critical infrastructure of the electric power grid of the United States. Building on the fundamental questions of risk assessment and management, this framework aims to advance the current risk analysis discussions pertaining to the electric power grid. Most of the previous risk-related studies on the electric power grid focus mainly on the recovery of the network from hurricanes and other natural disasters. In contrast, a disproportionately small number of studies explicitly investigate the vulnerability of the electric power grid to cyber-attack scenarios, and how they could be prevented or mitigated. Such a limited approach leaves the United States vulnerable to foreign and domestic threats (both state-sponsored and “lone wolf”) to infiltrate a network that lacks a comprehensive security environment or coordinated government response. By conducting a review of the literature and presenting a risk-based framework, this article underscores the need for a coordinated United States cyber security effort toward formulating strategies and responses conducive to protecting the nation against attacks on the electric power grid.<sep>Abstract The purpose of this article is to introduce a risk analysis framework to enhance the cyber security of and to protect the critical infrastructure of the electric power grid of the United States. Building on the fundamental questions of risk assessment and management, this framework aims to advance the current risk analysis discussions pertaining to the electric power grid. Most of the previous risk‐related studies on the electric power grid focus mainly on the recovery of the network from hurricanes and other natural disasters. In contrast, a disproportionately small number of studies explicitly investigate the vulnerability of the electric power grid to cyber‐attack scenarios, and how they could be prevented or mitigated. Such a limited approach leaves the United States vulnerable to foreign and domestic threats (both state‐sponsored and “lone wolf”) to infiltrate a network that lacks a comprehensive security environment or coordinated government response.

The “flatten the curve” expression has been widely used recently. To flatten the curve means to slow down the rate of disease transmission so as not to strain limited healthcare resources. In the absence of vaccines, the scientific community has urged for the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to flatten the curve. This paper applies the Leontief input-output model (IO) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy. The model uses publicly available IO data coupled with epi curves to estimate the ripple effects of workforce disruptions across interdependent sectors of the economy. The epi curve for the U.S. is characterized by an uptick of cases after the 2020 Memorial Day weekend, which is used as the baseline scenario. The paper then explores a mitigated scenario and evaluates the extent to which a flattened curve can effectively reduce the economic losses incurred by various sectors. The results of this study can be used to formulate policies for implementing NPIs, as well as to identify potential solutions to curb the impact of disasters, like the COVID-19 pandemic, on the workforce and the economy.<sep>In this study, we utilize an input–output (I–O) model to perform an ex-post analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic workforce disruptions in the Philippines. Unlike most disasters that debilitate physical infrastructure systems, the impact of disease pandemics like COVID-19 is mostly concentrated on the workforce. Workforce availability was adversely affected by lockdowns as well as by actual illness. The approach in this paper is to use Philippine I–O data for multiple years and generate Dirichlet probability distributions for the Leontief requirements matrix (i.e., the normalized sectoral transactions matrix) to address uncertainties in the parameters. Then, we estimated the workforce dependency ratio based on a literature survey and then computed the resilience index in each economic sector. For example, sectors that depend heavily on the physical presence of their workforce (e.g., construction, agriculture, manufacturing) incur more opportunity losses compared to sectors where workforce can telework (e.g., online retail, education, business process outsourcing). Our study estimated the 50th percentile economic losses in the range of PhP 3.3 trillion (with telework) to PhP 4.8 trillion (without telework), which is consistent with independently published reports. The study provides insights into the direct and indirect economic impacts of workforce disruptions in emerging economies and will contribute to the general domain of disaster risk management.<sep>Critical infrastructure networks, such as transportation and supply chains, are becoming increasingly interdependent. As the operability of network nodes relies on the operability of connected nodes, network disruptions have the potential to spread across entire networks, having catastrophic consequences in the realms of physical network performance and also economic performance. While risk-informed physical network models and economic models have been well-studied in the literature, there is limited study of how physical features of network performance interact with sector-specific economic performance, particularly as these physical networks recover from disruptions of varying durations. In this article, we create a generalizable framework for integrating Functional Dependency Network Analysis (FDNA) and Dynamic Inoperability Input-Output Models (DIIM), to assess the extent to which disruptions to critical infrastructure could degrade its functionality over a period of time. We demonstrate the framework using disruptive scenarios for a critical transportation network in Virginia, USA. We consider scenarios involving: (a) mild case that is relatively more frequent such as recurring traffic conditions; (b) moderate case involving an incident with a multihour delay, and (c) severe case that is relatively less frequent such as evacuation after a major hurricane. The results will be useful for network managers, policymakers, and stakeholders who are seeking to invest in risk mitigation for network functionality<sep>The \"flatten the curve\" graphic has recently become a common tool to visualize the extent to which pandemic suppression and mitigation measures could potentially reduce and delay the number of daily infections due to a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the capacity of the many healthcare systems and created cascading economic impacts on interdependent sectors of the global society. This paper specifically explores the impact of pandemics on the workforce. The model proposed in this paper comprises of three major steps. First, sources for epidemic curves are identified to generate the attack rate, which is the daily number of infections normalized with respect to the population of the affected region. Second, the model assumes that the general attack rate can be specialized to reflect sector-specific workforce classifications, noting that each economic sector has varying dependence on the workforce. Third, using economic input-output (IO) data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, this paper analyzes the performance of several mitigation and suppression measures relative to a baseline pandemic scenario. Results from the IO simulations demonstrate the extent to which mitigation and suppression measures can flatten the curve. This paper concludes with reflections on other consequences of pandemics such as the mental health impacts associated with social isolation and the disproportionate effects<sep>This research measures the epidemiological and economic impact of COVID-19 spread in the US under different mitigation scenarios, comprising of non-pharmaceutical interventions. A detailed disease model of COVID-19 is combined with a model of the US economy to estimate the direct impact of labor supply shock to each sector arising from morbidity, mortality, and lockdown, as well as the indirect impact caused by the interdependencies between sectors. During a lockdown, estimates of jobs that are workable from home in each sector are used to modify the shock to labor supply. Results show trade-offs between economic losses, and lives saved and infections averted are non-linear in compliance to social distancing and the duration of the lockdown. Sectors that are worst hit are not the labor-intensive sectors such as the Agriculture sector and the Construction sector, but the ones with high valued jobs such as the Professional Services, even after the teleworkability of jobs is accounted for. Additionally, the findings show that a low compliance to interventions can be overcome by a longer shutdown period and vice versa to arrive at similar epidemiological impact but their net effect on economic loss depends on the interplay between the marginal gains from averting infections and deaths, versus the marginal loss from having healthy workers stay<sep>Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a condition where blood flow from the heart through the body is inadequate, causing congestion in the lungs and swelling in the body's tissues. An urban university teaching hospital is able to treat and assign post-discharge resources to patients diagnosed with CHF. Despite the current treatment methods and assignment of post-discharge resources, the rate of readmission for patients returning to the hospital within 30 days remains higher than the level expected by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This project proposes the development of a decision support tool to assist the hospital in reducing the readmission rate for patients diagnosed with CHF. The project initially analyzes medical comorbidities and social factors of patients to identify correlations with a patient's probability of readmission. A discriminant analysis baseline model constructed from an electronic health record database (September 2015 to December 2018) projects the readmission probability for a patient. Subsequently, a correlation study determines which post-discharge resources are associated with reducing the readmission probability in patients with specific combinations of medical comorbidities and social factors. Ultimately, the decision support tool analyzes a patient's unique combination of medical severity and social factors to project the patient's probability of readmission and provides a tailored list of suggested post-discharge resources to<sep>Abstract Extreme weather events have considerable economic and social ramifications by disrupting public utility services, such as power outages, disconnecting phone service, and transportation interruptions. This study seeks to understand the performance and resilience of critical infrastructure systems in Houston, Texas, using Hurricane Harvey (2017) as a case study. We surveyed five hundred residents of the Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area after Hurricane Harvey's landfall. Our initial data analysis concentrated on the number of homes that reported interruptions in electricity, water, phone/cellphone, Internet, public transportation, places of employment, and grocery stores. We also estimate the duration of each type of disruption. Around 69% of the respondents reported electricity disruption, while half (49%) had no water supply for up to six days. Two-thirds of the surveyed households did not have internet access, and 47% had their phone services disconnected. Finally, around 70% of the respondents could not commute to their workplace, while 71% could not buy groceries for their families. We incorporated the household survey responses into the Dynamic Inoperability Input-Output Model (DIIM) to estimate inoperability and economic losses in multiple linked sectors. The total economic loss was estimated to be over $6 billion, and workforce disruption is the major challenge that policymakers must consider for improving resilience. Understanding the resilience of each<sep>Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have revolutionized and redefined the landscape of data analysis in business, healthcare, and technology. These methods have innovated the applied mathematics, computer science, and engineering fields and are showing considerable potential for risk science, especially in the disaster risk domain. The disaster risk field has yet to define itself as a necessary application domain for AI implementation by defining how to responsibly balance AI and disaster risk. (1) How is AI being used for disaster risk applications; and how are these applications addressing the principles and assumptions of risk science, (2) What are the benefits of AI being used for risk applications; and what are the benefits of applying risk principles and assumptions for AI‐based applications, (3) What are the synergies between AI and risk science applications, and (4) What are the characteristics of effective use of fundamental risk principles and assumptions for AI‐based applications? This study develops and disseminates an online survey questionnaire that leverages expertise from risk and AI professionals to identify the most important characteristics related to AI and risk, then presents a framework for gauging how AI and disaster risk can be balanced. This study is the first to develop a classification system for applying risk principles for AI‐based applications. This classification<sep>To manage limited resources available to protect against cybersecurity threats, organizations must use risk management approach to prioritize investments in protection capabilities. Currently, there is no commonly accepted methodology for cybersecurity professionals that considers one of the key elements of risk function – threat landscape – to identify gaps (blinds spots) where cybersecurity protections do not exist and where future investments are needed. This paper discusses a new, threat-based approach for evaluation of cybersecurity architectures that allows organizations to look at their cybersecurity protections from the standpoint of an adversary. The approach is based on a methodology developed by the Department of Defense and further expanded by the Department of Homeland Security. The threat-based approach uses a cyber threat framework to enumerate all threat actions previously observed in the wild and scores protections (cybersecurity architectural capabilities) against each threat action for their ability to: a) detect; b) protect against; and c) help in recovery from the threat action. The answers form a matrix called capability coverage map – a visual representation of protections coverage, gaps, and overlaps against threats. To allow for prioritization, threat actions can be organized in a threat heat map – a visual representation of threat actions’ prevalence and maneuverability that can be overlaid on top of a<sep>Recent studies in the area of disaster risk management emphasize the increasing likelihood and adverse consequences of droughts. Droughts can have widespread severe impacts; for example, in 2016, the northeastern region of the United States experienced record levels of rainfall shortage, forcing regional government agencies to issue warnings and emergency advisories to the public. During drought events, the economic losses due to water shortage and government-mandated restriction measures create costly cascading effects due to the interconnected and interdependent nature of the economic sectors. Such sectors have different degrees of dependence on water, and often there is a lack of coordination in implementing sector-specific resilience measures, which makes the drought recovery management a complex and daunting task. Indeed, water is a critical resource and it is essential in producing a myriad number of goods and services in the economy. In the current chapter, the authors develop a new modeling framework for drought risk management by integrating spatial analysis and dynamic input-output modeling to better understand the direct and indirect effects of drought scenarios on interdependent sectors of a regional economy. A decision support tool that utilizes the geographic information systems (GIS) platform was also developed to perform the following functions: (1) model the time-varying impacts of drought scenarios on a regional economy,<sep>The traditional threat modeling methodologies work well on a small scale, when evaluating targets such as a data field, a software application, or a system component–but they do not allow for comprehensive evaluation of an entire enterprise architecture. They also do not enumerate and consider a comprehensive set of actual threat actions observed in the wild. Because of the lack of adequate threat modeling methodologies for determining cybersecurity protection needs on an enterprise scale, cybersecurity executives and decision makers have traditionally relied upon marketing pressure as the main input into decision making for investments in cybersecurity capabilities (tools). A new methodology, originally developed by the Department of Defense then further expanded by the Department of Homeland Security, for the first time allows for a threat-based, end-to-end evaluation of cybersecurity architectures and determination of gaps or areas in need of future investments. Although in the public domain, this methodology has not been used outside of the federal government. This paper examines the new threat modeling approach that allows organizations to look at their cybersecurity protections from the standpoint of an adversary. The methodology enumerates threat actions that have been observed in the wild using a cyber threat framework and scores cybersecurity architectural capabilities for their ability to protect, detect, and recover from<sep>In this paper, we analyzed the association among trends in COVID-19 cases, climate, air quality, and mobility changes during the first and second waves of the pandemic in five major metropolitan counties in the United States: Maricopa in Arizona, Cook in Illinois, Los Angeles in California, Suffolk in Massachusetts, and New York County in New York. These areas represent a range of climate conditions, geographies, economies, and state-mandated social distancing restrictions. In the first wave of the pandemic, cases were correlated with humidity in Maricopa, and temperature in Maricopa and Los Angeles. In Suffolk and New York, cases were correlated with mobility changes in recreation, grocery, parks, and transit stations. Neither cases nor death counts were strongly correlated with air quality. Periodic fluctuations in mobility were observed for residential areas during weekends, resulting in stronger correlation coefficients when only weekday datasets were included in the analysis. We also analyzed case-mobility correlations when mobility days were lagged, and found that the strongest correlation in the first wave occurred between 12 and 14 lag days (optimal at 13 days). There was stronger but greater variability in correlation coefficients across metropolitan areas in the first pandemic wave than in the second wave, notably in recreation areas and parks. In the second wave, there was<sep>Water is a critical natural resource that sustains the productivity of many economic sectors, whether directly or indirectly. Climate change alongside rapid growth and development are a threat to water sustainability and regional productivity. In this paper, we develop an extension to the economic input-output model to assess the impact of water supply disruptions to regional economies. The model utilizes the inoperability variable, which measures the extent to which an infrastructure system or economic sector is unable to deliver its intended output. While the inoperability concept has been utilized in previous applications, this paper offers extensions that capture the time-varying nature of inoperability as the sectors recover from a disruptive event, such as drought. The model extension is capable of inserting inoperability adjustments within the drought timeline to capture time-varying likelihoods and severities, as well as the dependencies of various economic sectors on water. The model was applied to case studies of severe drought in two regions: (1) the state of Massachusetts (MA) and (2) the US National Capital Region (NCR). These regions were selected to contrast drought resilience between a mixed urban–rural region (MA) and a highly urban region (NCR). These regions also have comparable overall gross domestic products despite significant differences in the distribution and share of the economic</abstract>"]}

The many predictions fail to appreciate the full power of Francis’ deeply sacramental and ecclesial vision. In­formed by Vatican II and the Argentinian teología del pueblo, Pope Francis locates the sacramental work of Christ in two constantly interacting poles — the Eucharist and the peripheries. Via Pope Francis, these poles become recursively interactive twin starting points for the conversion of Catholic bioethics.<sep>Paul Farmer’s work and writings relentlessly centered the determinative yet rarely-mentioned role of political economy not only for shaping illness, health, and healthcare delivery, but also in shaping the narrow range of what are considered “ethical issues” by mainstream bioethics. This chapter draws on Farmer’s scholarship to detail how economics—particularly neoliberal economics–has shaped the conceptual apparatus of bioethics and, thereby, has subsequently reinforced neoliberal assumptions in healthcare and our broader social context. This analysis presses us to ask: in what ways does neoliberalism equally enthrall the disciplines of theology and theological ethics? If so, what can we do about it?<sep>Editorial introduction for the volume 13, number 1, January 2024 issue of the Journal of Moral Theology . M. Therese Lysaught revisits the Journal of Moral Theology ’s initial rationale as articulated by founding editor David Matzko McCarthy. While that vision has developed over the intervening decade, many of his inaugural insights continue to shape our work. She then turns to documents produced by Pope Francis and the Synod on Synodality in Fall 2023, distilling five key themes and highlighting points of alignment with the Journal of Moral Theology . She closes with an overview of the current issue, suggesting how a dozen years later, the Journal of Moral Theology ’s vision has matured and expanded, advancing what we might now call a synodal moral theology.<sep>The essays that comprise this book—commissioned from theologians from around the world—are guided by three purposes: First, to honor the extraordinary life and the prophetic Christian witness of Dr. Paul Farmer, and second, and perhaps most significantly, to acknowledge and describe the influence and impact that his scholarly work and on-the-ground praxis have had on the field of theological ethics in general and on each of the contributors individually. As will be evident, Dr. Farmer’s life, witness, and work have influenced our thinking, sometimes called into question our long-held assumptions about the moral life and the role of the theologian, and in turn, impacted our scholarly production and teaching. Beyond this, we believe, thirdly, that it holds important insights for the work of theological ethics going forward.<sep>Roman Catholics comprise the largest single denomination in the United States and are the nation’s largest group of not-for-profit healthcare providers. Yet, there is little or no available literature to assist neonatal caregivers in understanding how religious beliefs and values might influence parents’ responses to the challenges posed by their newborn’s care. Equally, there is little or no available literature on the academic or pastoral side addressing questions of neonatal medicine from a theological perspective. This chapter addresses how Roman Catholic teachings might affect the ways in which parents and caregivers make treatment decisions. It examines the neonatal context in light of five aspects of Catholic teaching—the dignity of the human person, patient decision making, withholding and withdrawing treatment, palliative care, and Catholic social thought—as well as three important Catholic practices—baptism, the anointing of the sick, and the care of babies’ bodies, living and dead.<sep>Abstract The principle of stewardship has come to play a significant role in the consciousness of Catholic health care. This is a recent development correlative with changes in the economic configurations of Catholic health care in the latter two decades of the twentieth century, as well as with the striking ascendance of the principle within US Catholic culture during the same period. Yet while the concept of stewardship seems to be an unobjectionable given central to Catholic practice, I argue that in its contemporary configuration, it embodies a deeply problematic set of theological assumptions drawn from a particular historical trajectory that is—from a Catholic perspective—quite troubling. This history is concurrent with an equally problematic deformation of the concept of charity. Taken together, these malformed concepts often shackle and misdirect the ability of those who work within Catholic health care to creatively discern transformative solutions and faithful modes of practice.<sep>As place-based philanthropic institutions, community foundations have generated an inextricable linkage between community development initiatives and local funders that, when bolstered by robust data, drives innovative approaches to community needs and quantifiable improvements across community wellbeing indicators. Growing out of an innovative partnership with the Athens Area Community Foundation, the Athens Wellbeing Project applies collaborative cross-sector approaches to data collection and analysis that guide Athens-area community development initiatives. The Athens Wellbeing Project model is adaptive to changes in community needs, using the Social Determinants of Health as a framework to define dimensions of wellbeing that inform subsequent iterations of data collection. This case study discusses how the Athens Wellbeing Project’s connection to local stakeholders, development of a robust data collection tool, and partnership with a place-based philanthropic institution have led to improved quality of life in the community and the establishment of sustainable data-driven decision making in key anchor institutions.<sep>This essay asks: How do the realities of embodied trauma inflicted by racism interface with virtue theory? This question illuminates two lacunae in virtue theory. The first is attention to race. We argue that the contemporary academic virtue literature performs largely as a White space, failing to address virtue theory’s role in the social construction of race, ignoring the rich and vibrant resources on virtue ethics alive within the Black theological tradition that long antedates Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue, and segregating the emerging literature on race and virtue from the broader discourse. The second is lack of attention to embodiment. More precisely, contemporary virtue theory, informed largely by Aristotle, Aquinas, and MacIntyre, has no conceptual space to theorize the body’s role acquiring and deploying virtue and vice. To explore this nexus, we draw on racial trauma therapist Resmaa Menakem, Katie Walker Grimes, and Howard Thurman’s Jesus and the Disinherited to challenge contemporary virtue theory and open new possibilities for a robustly corporate, enfleshed theological virtue ethic.<sep>Over the twentieth century, consolidation and intense focus on the bottom line by highly trained management executives have transformed Catholic health care into multi-billion dollar corporations once unimaginable by the founding sisters and brothers. Such largess has been accrued within a context rife with structural injustices, including residential segregation and black community disinvestment. This essay explores the relationship between residential segregation—named an intrinsic evil by Pope John Paul II in Veritatis Splendor and in Gaudium et Spes—and Catholic health care. The concentrated poverty associated with residential segregation in the U.S. is an engine of health disparities; it also generates financial benefits for health care given the contemporary structure of health care finance and reimbursement. We utilize M. Cathleen Kaveney’s concept of the appropriation of evil to analyze moral dynamics implicit at the interface of residential segregation and Catholic health care, simultaneously demonstrating how the category of appropriation might be expanded to questions of social and structural sin. We also identify additional dynamics of appropriation, namely, moral inhibition, scandal, and implicit ratification. We close with constructive suggestions for ways that Catholic health care might engage with the realities of residential segregation to more constructively address health disparities with moral integrity.<sep>For international healthcare NGOs, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been significant. Healthcare workers in both LMICs and high-income countries have described the impact of the pandemic as traumatic. This article focuses on one initiative designed to address this impact: CMMB’s Building Resiliency program. This article provides an overview of the structure and content of program, situating it within the landscape of global mental healthcare disparities and caregiver trauma. Designed to address caregiver mental health in Peru, Haiti, Kenya, South Sudan, and Zambia, the program sought to offset global mental healthcare disparities by bringing needed psycho-social-spiritual support to CMMB staff. It was intentionally shaped by the commitments of Catholic social thought—particularly to the well-being, dignity, and integral human development of CMMB staff members, to envisaging new forms of solidarity, and to prioritizing subsidiarity and participation. Theories of post-traumatic growth provided the theoretical framework for three remotely delivered seminar series, which made space for staff members to share their stories with their colleagues, to build community, to foster creativity and hope, and to intentionally integrate faith and spirituality into both personal self-care as well as the common life of the organization. Thus, this was designed equally to build the organizational resiliency that is the fruit of Catholic social thought. For attending to caregivers’ mental health and well-being is crucial not only for the success of medical missions but for embodying and witnessing the Catholic commitment to the human dignity and the integral development of those who do the work of our organizations.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Hippocampal formation<sep>Skeletal muscle<sep>Osteoporosis<sep>Epigenetics<sep>Parkinson's

can be managed with the use of diabetes self‐management skills. Diet and exercise are essential segments of the lifestyle changes necessary for diabetes management. However, diet recommendations can be complicated in a world full of different diets. This review aims to evaluate the evidence on the effects of three popular diets geared towards diabetes management: low‐carbohydrate and ketogenic diet, vegan diet, and the Mediterranean diet. While all three diets have been shown to assist in improving glycaemic control and weight loss, patient adherence, acceptability, and<sep>Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease are common chronic illnesses in the United States and lack clearly demonstrated therapeutics. Mitochondria, the \"powerhouse of the cell\", is involved in the homeostatic regulation of glucose, energy, and reduction/oxidation reactions. The mitochondria has been associated with the etiology of metabolic and neurological disorders through a dysfunction of regulation of reactive oxygen species. Mitochondria-targeted chemicals, such as the Szeto-Schiller-31 peptide, have advanced therapeutic potential through the inhibition of oxidative stress and the restoration of normal mitochondrial function as compared to traditional antioxidants, such as vitamin<sep>As the population ages, obesity and metabolic complications as well as neurological disorders are becoming more prevalent, with huge economic burdens on both societies and families. New therapeutics are urgently needed. Nerve growth factor (NGF), first discovered in 1950s, is a neurotrophic factor involved in regulating cell proliferation, growth, survival, and apoptosis in both central and peripheral nervous systems. NGF and its precursor, proNGF, bind to TrkA and p75 receptors and initiate protein phosphorylation cascades, resulting in changes of cellular functions, and are associated with obesity, diabetes and its<sep>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complicated metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder characterized by a chronic loss of cognitive and behavioral function. Considering the shared characteristics of both diseases, common therapeutic and preventive agents may be effective. Bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, vitamins, and carotenoids found in vegetables and fruits can have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These effects make them suitable candidates for the prevention or treatment of diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Increasing evidence from cell or animal models<sep>In the last decade, the number of full-time registered dietitians (RDs) serving intercollegiate athletes in the United States has more than quadrupled. However, many student athletes may be at increased risk of nutrition-related problems that impact physical and academic performance, which include inadequate macronutrients, inadequate micronutrients, and excessive macronutrients. This narrative review reports the current literature to date on nutrition-related knowledge in collegiate athletes and the impact of sports RDs on student athletes’ nutrition knowledge and behaviors. To date, only observational and quasi-experimental studies have been published with regard<sep>Obesity is caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. Despite extensive study, contemporary through diet, exercise, education, surgery, and pharmacological treatments, no effective long-term solution has been found to this epidemic. Over the last decade, there has been a tremendous advancement in understanding the science of epigenetics, as well as a rise in public interest in learning more about the influence of diet and lifestyle choices on the health of an individual. Without affecting the underlying DNA sequence, epigenetic alterations impact gene expression. Previous animal studies have<sep>In recent years, obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally and has become a major public health concern. The development of obesity is likely caused by several behavioral, environmental, and genetic factors. Genomic variability among individuals is largely due to copy number variations (CNVs). Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified many loci containing CNV related to obesity. These obesity-related CNVs are informative to the diagnosis and treatment of genomic diseases. A more comprehensive classification of CNVs may provide the basis for determining how genomic diversity impacts the mechanisms<sep>Skeletal muscle atrophy is prevalent in a myriad of pathological conditions, such as diabetes, denervation, long-term immobility, malnutrition, sarcopenia, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and cachexia. This is a critically important topic that has significance in the health of the current society, particularly older adults. The most damaging effect of muscle atrophy is the decreased quality of life from functional disability, increased risk of fractures, decreased basal metabolic rate, and reduced bone mineral density. Most skeletal muscle in humans contains slow oxidative, fast oxidative, and fast glycolytic muscle fiber types. Depending<sep>Childhood obesity is an epidemic connected with poor eating. According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS), food deserts are geographical locations in which residents have restricted or nonexistent access to healthful and quality food. Restricted access to healthy food is commonly associated with poor nutrition-related health outcomes, including obesity. This review aims to highlight the relationship between residing in a food desert or a similar environment on body mass index (BMI) in school-aged children in North America, predominantly in the Midwest region of the<sep>Previous work from our lab demonstrated a new role of TrkA in the insulin signaling pathway. The kinase activity of TrkA is essential for its interaction with the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and activation of Akt and Erk5 in PC12 cells. Here we show in brain from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic rats that the expression of the inactive proNGF is elevated, whereas the expression of mature NGF is reduced. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA is decreased in STZ-induced diabetes compared to control. Results<sep>Objective: Altering the gut microflora may produce health benefits in individuals suffering from mood disorders. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics as a potential treatment for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (as psychobiotics).Methods: Google Scholar, PubMed, PsychINFO, and Web of Science were utilized to identify and evaluate studies through October 31, 2019. Studies were included if subjects were evaluated for altered mood or stress levels at start of the study and consumed probiotics, prebiotics, and/or synbiotics for intervention.Results: Search<sep>Obesity is associated with numerous health issues such as sleep disorders, asthma, hepatic dysfunction, cancer, renal dysfunction, diabetes, cardiovascular complications, and infertility. Previous research has shown that the distribution of excess body fat, rather than excess body weight, determines obesity-related risk factors. It is widely accepted that abdominal fat is a serious risk factor for illnesses associated with obesity and the accumulation of visceral fat promotes the release of pro-oxidants, pro-inflammatory, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The metabolic process in the human body produces several volatile organic compounds (VOCs)<sep>C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver due to inflammation. Higher CRP concentration has been linked to the increased risk of developing diabetes. Saliva is a biofluid rich in more analytes, proteins, peptides, and an alternative for serum/plasma to identify disease markers. Increased salivary CRP concentration is due to the low-grade inflammation associated with type 2-diabetes (T2D). This chapter focuses on the extent of CRP in different pathogenic conditions, explicitly discussing the CRP relationship with diabetes. The circulating CRP is used as a biomarker to<sep>The magnitude of the childhood obesity epidemic and its effects on public health has accelerated the pursuit of practical preventative measures. Epigenetics is one subject that holds a lot of promise, despite being relatively new. The study of potentially heritable variations in gene expression that do not require modifications to the underlying DNA sequence is known as epigenetics. Here, we used Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array to identify differentially methylated regions in DNA isolated from saliva between normal weight (NW) and overweight/obese (OW/OB) children and between European American (EA) and<sep>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with diminished nutrition status and decreased quality of life. While the prevalence of PD is expected to increase, no preventative or curative therapy for PD exists at this time. Although nutrition and diet represent modifiable risk factors for reducing chronic disease risk, research on the impact of single nutrients on PD has yielded mixed results. As a result, this single-nutrient approach may be the driving force behind the inconsistency, and a holistic dietary approach may overcome this inconsistency by accounting for<sep>Obesity is a growing worldwide problem that generally starts in the early years of life and affects minorities more often than Whites. Thus, there is an urgency to determine factors that can be used as targets as indicators of obesity. In this study, we attempt to generate a profile of gut and oral microbial clades predictive of disease status in African American (AA) and European American (EA) children. 16S rDNA sequencing of the gut and saliva microbial profiles were correlated with salivary amylase, socioeconomic factors (e.g., education and family<sep>Salivary amylase (AMY1) is the most abundant enzyme in human saliva, responsible for the hydrolysis of α-1,4 glycosidic linkages that aids in the digestion of starch. Recently studies have shown that the copy number of AMY1 is associated with obesity; however, the data varies with location. One-third of children are overweight/obese in Alabama. In this study, we aim to determine the relationship between the copy number of AMY1 gene and obesity measurements in children from Alabama. One hundred twenty-seven children aged between 6 to 10 years participated in this<sep>Obesity increases the risk of developing insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The current study is designed to evaluate the association of salivary fetuin-A, insulin, and adiponectin with the obesity measures in children.Seventy-six children aged 6-10 years participated in the study. Anthropometric measurements were recorded, and saliva was collected from the participants. Based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the participants were classified into normal weight (NW), overweight (OW), and obese (OB). Multiplex analysis for salivary markers fetuin-A, insulin, and adiponectin was performed using Luminex performance<sep>To date, there is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative condition that affects memory, language, and behavior. AD is characterized by neuroinflammation, accumulation of brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles, increased neuronal apoptosis, and loss of synaptic function. Promoting regular exercise and a diet containing polyphenols are effective non-pharmacological approaches that prevent the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we measured various conformational toxic species of Aβ and markers of inflammation, apoptosis, endolysosomal degradation, and neuroprotection after 5 months of exercise<sep>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive decline and characterized by amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. Although AD's exact pathophysiology remains unclear, oxidative stress is known to play a role in the neurodegenerative process. Since no curative treatment exists, antioxidants represent a potential treatment for AD due to their ability to modulate oxidative stress. Therefore, this review aims to examine the impact of antioxidant supplementation and its potential mechanisms on cognitive function. The review primarily discusses research articles published between 2012 and 2022 reporting<sep>Dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has been reported to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Stearidonic acid (SDA), a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid, has been targeted as a potential surrogate for fish-based fatty acids. However, its role in neuronal degeneration is unknown. This study was designed to evaluate effects of SDA on Amyloid-β(A-β)-induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal cells. Results showed that SDA effectively converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in hippocampal cells. Aβ-induced apoptosis in H19-7 cells was protected by SDA pretreatment as evidenced by<sep>We have previously shown that the expression of pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) was significantly increased, nerve growth factor (NGF) level was decreased, and the expression of p75NTR was enhanced in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) hippocampal samples. NGF regulates cell survival and differentiation by binding TrkA and p75NTR receptors. ProNGF is the precursor form of NGF, binds to p75NTR, and induces cell apoptosis. The objective of this study is to determine whether the increased p75NTR expression in AD is due to the accumulation of proNGF and Rho kinase activation. PC12 cells<sep>Abstract This systematic review aims to evaluate all epidemiological evidence in the literature linking the effect of vitamin D supplementation to metabolic and hormonal functions in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The literature search was performed with two databases, namely Medline/PubMed and Web of Science, until 20 May 2019 for both observational and experimental studies concerning relationships between vitamin D and polycystic ovary syndrome. A total of ten studies with randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial design from 2008 to 2019 were selected for this review. The inclusion criteria were<sep>Disparities between the races have been well documented in health and disease in the USA. Recent studies show that telomere length, a marker of aging, is associated with obesity and obesity-related diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. The current study aimed to evaluate the connection between telomere length ratio, blood pressure, and childhood obesity. The telomere length ratio was measured in 127 children from both European American (EA) and African American (AA) children, aged 6–10 years old. AA children had a significantly high relative telomere to the single<sep>We have recently shown that the copy number of salivary amylase (AMY1) gene was significantly decreased, and the obesity-related salivary biomarkers resistin, MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP were signiﬁcantly increased in overweight/obese children compared to normal weight. This study aimed to evaluate the association of AMY1 copy number variant (CNV) with obesity and inflammatory markers. Seventy-six participants aged between 6 and 10 years have participated, and the saliva samples were collected along with the anthropometric measurements.AMY1 copy number was analyzed by 3D digital PCR, and obesity-related biomarkers were performed<sep>Diabetes mellitus (DM)-induced brain damage is characterized by cellular, molecular and functional changes. The mechanisms include oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, reduction of neurotrophic factors, insulin resistance, excessive amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and Tau phosphorylation. Both antidiabetic and neuroprotective effects of the phytoestrogen genistein have been reported. However, the beneficial effect of genistein in brain of the ob/ob mouse model of severe obesity and diabetes remains to be determined.In this study, female ob/ob mice and lean control mice were fed with either a standard diet or a diet containing genistein (600mg/kg)<sep>Fetuin-A (Fet-A) is a liver-secreted phosphorylated protein, known to impair insulin signaling, which has been shown to be associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and incident diabetes. Fet-A interacts with the insulin-stimulated insulin receptor (IR) and inhibits IR tyrosine kinase activity and glucose uptake. It has been shown that high glucose increases Fet-A expression through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, factors that downregulate Fet-A expression and their potential mechanisms are unclear. We examined the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on high-glucose induced Fet-A expression in HepG2 cells, Hep3B cells<sep>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis are progressive diseases that affect the elderly population. Both conditions are associated with fracture risk that is greater than twice that of the healthy population. Resveratrol and exercise are two treatments that have been linked with attenuation of age-related diseases, including the risk of bone fractures. In this study, we test the hypothesis that these treatments improve fracture resistance in a mouse model representative of the AD condition.Three-month-old male 3xTg-AD mice were treated for 4 months with resveratrol or exercise or both combined, and<sep>Obesity is linked with higher inflammatory markers and is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation. Neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and β-nerve growth factor (β-NGF), in addition to their neuronal functions, act on several immune cells and have been recently designated as metabokines due to their regulatory role in energy homeostasis and food intake. The current study evaluates the salivary BDNF and β-NGF and their association with anthropometric measurement, blood pressure, and salivary insulin in children. Anthropometric measurements and saliva samples were obtained from 76 children, aged 6-10 years. Multiplex<sep>The occurrence of obesity stems from both genetic and external influences. Despite thorough research and attempts to address it through various means such as dietary changes, physical activity, education, and medications, a lasting solution to this widespread problem remains elusive. Nutrients play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression. One of the mechanisms by which nutrients can affect gene expression is through DNA methylation. This modification can alter the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, thereby influencing gene expression.<sep>Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the progressive loss of function or structure of nerve cells in the central nervous system. The most common neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, motor neuron disease, and Parkinson's disease. Although the physical or mental symptoms of neurodegenerative disease may be relieved by various treatment combinations, there are currently no strategies to directly slow or prevent neurodegeneration. Given the demographic evidence of a rapidly growing aging population and the associated prevalence of these common neurodegenerative diseases, it is paramount to develop safe and<sep>In recent decades, a shift in the nutritional landscape to the Western-style diet has led to an unprecedented rise in the prevalence of obesity and neurodegenerative diseases. Consumption of a healthy diet and engaging in regular physical activity represents safe and affordable approaches known to mitigate the adverse consequences of the Western diet. We examined whether genistein treatment, exercise training, and a combination treatment (genistein and exercise training) mitigated the effects of a Western diet-induced by high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) in brain of female mice. HFHS increased the amyloid-beta (Aβ)<sep>Copy number variants (CNVs) provide numerous genetic differences between individuals, and they have been linked with multiple human diseases. Obesity is one of the highly heritable complex disorders, which is associated with copy number variance (CNV). A recent report shows that the 11q11 gene, a novel olfactory receptor, and its copy number variants are involved in the early onset of obesity. In the current study, we analyzed the 11q11 gene copy number variance (CNV) based on gender in White/European American (EA) and African American (AA) normal weight and overweight/obese<sep>Childhood obesity has affected the health of millions of children around the world despite vigorous efforts by health experts. The obesity epidemic in the United States has disproportionately afflicted certain racial and ethnic minority groups. African American children are more likely than other children to have obesity-related risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For the reduction in obesity-related health inequalities to be successful, it is essential to identify the variables affecting various groups. A notable advancement in epigenetic biology has been made over<sep>Obesity is a state of chronic low-level inflammation closely associated with oxidative stress. Childhood obesity is associated with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress markers individually. This study was aimed at determining the association between the biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction in urine samples of healthy, overweight, and obese children. Eighty-eight elementary school children aged between 6 and 10 years participated in this study. Anthropometric measurements were measured using WHO recommendations. The biomarkers of low-grade inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and α-1-acid glycoprotein<sep>Overweight and obesity is a pro-inflammatory state. This study aimed to examine the level of the salivary obesity markers in normal weight (NW) and overweight/obese (OW/OB) children, association with the obesity measures and the interrelations between the biomarkers.Seventy-six children (40 normal weight and 36 overweight/obese) were recruited for this study. Body weight, height, and waist circumference measurement were obtained. The saliva sample was collected from all the participants. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the participants were classified into the normal weight or overweight/obese depending<sep>T2DM is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. It is recognized as one of the most common metabolic disorders and its prevalence continues to raise major concerns in healthcare globally. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradual neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized by the chronic loss of cognitive and behavioral function. Recent research suggests a link between the two diseases. Considering the shared characteristics of both diseases, common therapeutic and preventive agents are effective.

almost 1.3 million new cases of prostate cancer and 359,000 associated deaths in 2018, ranking it as the second most frequent cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in men.1 The American Cancer Society's estimates for prostate cancer in the United States for 2018 are about 164,690 new patients with diagnosis of prostate cancer.2 About 80% of patients with prostate cancer are diagnosed while the disease is localized, as opposed to 20% of newly diagnosed prostate cancers that are advanced or metastatic.<sep>Characterization of the tumor microenvironment through immunoprofiling has become an essential resource for the understanding of the complex immune cell interactions and the assessment of biomarkers for prognosis and prediction of immunotherapy response; however, these studies are often limited by tissue heterogeneity and sample size. The nanoString GeoMx® Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) is a platform that allows high-plex profiling at the protein and RNA level, providing spatial and temporal assessment of tumors in frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded limited tissue sample. Recently, high-impact studies have shown the feasibility of using this technology to identify biomarkers in different settings, including predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in different tumor types. These studies showed that compared to other multiplex and high-plex platforms, the DSP can interrogate a higher number of biomarkers with higher throughput; however, it does not provide single-cell resolution, including co-expression of biomarker or spatial<sep>Chemoradiotherapy is a standard treatment for HNSCC. Blockade of the PD-1/L1-2 interaction may represent a target to overcome immune escape during this treatment.Utilizing a HNSCC mEERL C57BL/6 mouse model, we evaluated a PD-1 blockade alone or in combination with cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. Next, we evaluated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with relative PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3 expression, and myeloid-derived suppressor-like (MDSC-like) populations from a clinical trial evaluating PD-1 blockade with chemoradiotherapy in HNSCC. Finally, we analyzed the effect of therapy on human T-cell clonality through T-cell Receptor (TCR) sequencing.Anti-PD-1 monotherapy induced no response in the mEERL model; however, combination with chemoradiotherapy improved tumor clearance and survival. PBMCs from patients treated with this combination therapy demonstrate a decline in circulating T-cell populations with knockdown of PD-1 expressing CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells during treatment. However, TIM-3, LAG-3 expressing T-cell and MDSC-like populations concordantly rose.<sep>The safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of elraglusib, a GSK-3b small molecule inhibitor, as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy, in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or hematologic malignancies was studied.Elraglusib (intravenously twice weekly in three-week cycles) monotherapy dose-escalation was followed by dose-escalation with eight chemotherapy regimens (gemcitabine, doxorubicin, lomustine, carboplatin, irinotecan, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel/carboplatin, and pemetrexed/carboplatin) in patients previously exposed to the same chemotherapy.Patients received monotherapy (n=67) or combination therapy (n=171) elraglusib doses 1-15 mg/kg twice weekly. The initial recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of elraglusib was 15 mg/kg twice weekly and was defined, without DLT observation, due to fluid volumes necessary for drug administration. The RP2D was subsequently reduced to 9.3 mg/kg once weekly to reduce elraglusib-associated central/peripheral vascular access catheter blockages. Other common elraglusib-related adverse events (AE) included transient visual changes and fatigue.

Variations in the definition of BRPCand neoadjuvant approaches have made standardizing care for BRPC difficult. We report an effort to standardize management of BRPC throughout Sanford Health, a large community oncology network. Methods: Starting in October 2013, cases of PC without known metastatic disease were categorized as BRPC if they met ≥1of the following criteria: 1) abutment of superior mesenteric, common hepatic or celiac arteries with <180° involvement, 2) venous involvement deemed potentially suitable for reconstruction, and/or 3) biopsy proven lymph node involvement. Patients with BRPC were treated with NAC followed by reimaging and surgery if venous involvement had improved; if disease remained borderline resectable, patients underwent NACR and surgical exploration as long as reimaging did not reveal evidence of<sep>Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally-advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HSNCC) yields 5-year survival rates near 50% despite causing significant toxicity. Dichloroacetate (DCA), a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase metabolic inhibitor, reduces tumor lactate production and has been used in cancer therapy previously. The safety of adding this agent to CRT is unknown. Our randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II study added DCA to cisplatin-based CRT in patients with LA-HNSCC. The primary endpoint was safety by adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints compared efficacy via 3-month end-of-treatment response, 5-year progression-free and overall survival. Translational research evaluated pharmacodynamics of serum metabolite response. 45 participants (21 DCA, 24 Placebo) were enrolled from May 2011-April 2014. Higher rates of all-grade drug related fevers (43% vs 8%, p = 0.01) and decreased platelet count (67% vs 33%, p = 0.02) were seen in DCA versus placebo.

We report the long-term outcomes from this study.MethodsPatients with previously untreated advanced nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK alterations were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive open-label pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus carboplatin at area under the concentration-time curve of 5 mg/mL/min (four cycles) with or without pembrolizumab 200 mg (up to 2 years), with optional pemetrexed maintenance, each administered every 3 weeks. Eligible patients could crossover from the chemotherapy arm to pembrolizumab monotherapy after progression. Responses were assessed per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1.ResultsAfter the median time of 49.4 months from randomization to data cutoff, objective response rate (58% versus 33%) and progression-free survival (median: 24.5 versus 9.9 mo;<sep>Cohort G of KEYNOTE-021 (NCT02039674) evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-carboplatin (PC) versus PC alone as first-line therapy for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. At the primary analysis (median follow-up time 10.6 months), pembrolizumab significantly improved objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS); the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) was 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42‒1.91). Herein, we present an updated analysis.A total of 123 patients with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR and/or ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) aberrations were randomized 1:1 to four cycles of PC with or without pembrolizumab, 200 mg every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab treatment continued for 2 years; maintenance pemetrexed was permitted in both groups. Eligible patients in the PC-alone group with radiologic progression could cross over to pembrolizumab monotherapy. p Values are nominal (one-sided p < 0.025).As of December<sep>The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) Study is a pragmatic basket trial evaluating antitumor activity of approved targeted agents in patients with advanced cancers harboring potentially actionable genomic alterations. Data from cohorts of patients with high tumor mutational burden (HTMB, defined as ≥9 mutations per megabase) with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and other advanced cancers treated with pembrolizumab are reported.Eligible patients were 18 years and older with measurable tumors and a lack of standard treatment options, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and adequate organ function. The primary end point was disease control (DC), defined as complete or partial response or stable disease (SD) of at least 16-weeks duration. For the CRC cohort, Simon's two-stage design with a null DC rate of 15% versus 35% (power = 0.85; α = .10) was used. Low accruing histology-specific cohorts<sep>Pembrolizumab + PC demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in ORR, PFS, and OS vs PC alone as 1L therapy for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC in prior analyses of KEYNOTE-021 (NCT02039674) cohort G, at median follow-up of 10.6 and 23.9 months. We report outcomes with 31.0 months median follow-up. Patients with previously untreated, stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR/ALK alteration were randomized 1:1 (stratification: PD-L1 tumor proportion score <1% vs ≥1%) to carboplatin AUC 5+pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 Q3W (4 cycles) ± pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W (up to 35 cycles). Maintenance pemetrexed was permitted. Eligible patients with radiologic progression on PC could cross over to pembrolizumab. Response was assessed by blinded, independent central review (RECIST v1.1). Median follow-up (time from randomization to data cutoff [19Aug2019]) was 48.3 (range, 42.8‒55.6) mo. ORR was improved with pembrolizumab + PC vs PC (Table). 5 patients with SD/PR at<sep>PURPOSE In KEYNOTE-189, first-line pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum in patients with metastatic nonsquamous non‒small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), irrespective of tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. We report an updated analysis from KEYNOTE-189 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02578680 ). METHODS Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive pemetrexed and platinum plus pembrolizumab (n = 410) or placebo (n = 206) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then pemetrexed maintenance plus pembrolizumab or placebo for up to a total of 35 cycles. Eligible patients with disease progression in the placebo-combination group could cross over to pembrolizumab monotherapy. Response was assessed per RECIST (version 1.1) by central review. No alpha was assigned to this updated analysis. RESULTS As of September 21, 2018 (median follow-up, 23.1 months), the updated median (95% CI) OS was 22.0 (19.5<sep>In the phase III KEYNOTE-189 study (NCT02578680), pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy (pemetrexed-platinum) significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) versus placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum. We report updated efficacy outcomes from the protocol-specified final analysis, including outcomes in patients who crossed over to pembrolizumab from pemetrexed-platinum and in patients who completed 35 cycles (∼2 years) of pembrolizumab.Eligible patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg (n = 410) or placebo (n = 206) every 3 weeks (for up to 35 cycles, ∼2 years) plus four cycles of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and investigators' choice of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or carboplatin (area under the curve 5 mg·min/ml) every 3 weeks, followed by pemetrexed until progression.

The results in a cohort of patients with solid tumors with BRAF mutations treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib are reported. METHODS Eligible patients had measurable disease (RECIST v.1.1), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, adequate organ function, and no standard treatment options. The primary end point was disease control (DC), defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease of at least 16-weeks duration (SD16+). Low-accruing histology-specific cohorts with BRAF mutations treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib were collapsed into a single histology-pooled cohort for this analysis. The results were evaluated on the basis of a one-sided exact binomial test with a null<sep>RECIST is the primary tool for assessing tumor response in patients with solid tumors. Immunotherapy agents have shown unique response patterns. Assessment of the contribution of such patterns to OS is of interest. This analysis evaluates early tumor size change (TSC) cutoffs for their association with OS, assesses whether deeper response had greater association with OS than the 30% RECIST cutoff, and quantifies the contribution of ORR and duration of response (DOR) to OS benefit among patients with metastatic nonsquamous non‒small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving pembrolizumab + pemetrexed-platinum in KEYNOTE-189 (NCT02578680). For patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR/ALK alteration who received pembrolizumab + pemetrexed-platinum in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 study (data cutoff: May 20, 2019), we evaluated associations between OS and early TSC (percentage change from baseline in sum of target lesion diameters at study week 12) using<sep><h3>Background</h3> Expressed on activated T and natural killer cells, 4-1BB/CD137 is a costimulatory receptor that signals a series of events resulting in cytokine secretion and enhanced effector function. Targeting 4-1BB/CD137 with agonist antibodies has been associated with tumor reduction and antitumor immunity. C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is highly expressed in various solid tumor indications and associated with poor prognosis. This phase Ib, open-label study in patients with advanced solid tumors assessed the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of utomilumab (PF-05082566), a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) agonist of the T-cell costimulatory receptor 4-1BB/CD137, in combination with mogamulizumab, a humanized mAb targeting CCR4 reported to deplete subsets of regulatory T cells (Tregs). <h3>Methods</h3> Utomilumab 1.2–5 mg/kg or 100 mg flat dose every 4 weeks plus mogamulizumab 1 mg/kg (weekly in Cycle 1 followed by biweekly in Cycles ≥2) was administered intravenously to 24<sep>IntroductionThis exploratory analysis retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC to determine whether baseline brain metastases influenced the efficacy of first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.MethodsWe pooled data for patients with advanced NSCLC in KEYNOTE-021 cohort G (nonsquamous), KEYNOTE-189 (nonsquamous), and KEYNOTE-407 (squamous). Patients were assigned to platinum-doublet chemotherapy with or without the addition of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. All studies permitted enrollment of patients with previously treated or untreated (KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 only) stable brain metastases. Patients with previously treated brain metastases were clinically stable for 2 or more weeks (≥4 wk in KEYNOTE-021 cohort G), had no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and had no steroid use at least 3 days before dosing. Patients with known untreated asymptomatic brain metastases required regular imaging of the brain.ResultsA total of 1298 patients were<sep>The role of radiotherapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma is controversial. We prospectively tested the feasibility and efficacy of radiotherapy to defer systemic therapy for patients with oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma.This single-arm, phase 2, feasibility trial was done at one centre in the USA (The MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA). Patients (aged ≥18 years) with five or fewer metastatic lesions, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0-2, and no more than one previous systemic therapy (if this therapy was stopped at least 1 month before enrolment) without limitations on renal cell carcinoma histology were eligible for inclusion. Patients were treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (defined as ≤5 fractions with ≥7 Gy per fraction) to all lesions and maintained off systemic therapy. When lesion location precluded safe stereotactic body radiotherapy, patients were treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy regimes consisting of<sep>e13525 Background: Genomic testing (GT) is increasingly used to guide treatment in cancer care. There is considerable international variation in provider expertise and access to molecular tumor board (MTB) and therapeutics. In Ireland high quality GT is not broadly available; only 3% of patients receive treatment on a clinical trial. Our hypothesis is that increased GT would lead to enhanced treatment options and increase access to trials. Through institutional partnership between community cancer programs in Ireland and the United States (US), we offered GT and collaborative MTB review to patients with advanced cancer and observed the effect on treatment patterns. Methods: Eligible patients with metastatic solid tumors attending a single Irish community cancer unit between 2018 and 2022 were offered GT and collaborative MTB review on the COMPASS study. Testing was completed using a Foundation Medicine test reimbursed by multiple payors. Testing<sep>KEYNOTE-021 cohort C was the first study to show antitumor activity for pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy in previously untreated advanced nonsquamous NSCLC; the combination significantly improved efficacy vs platinum-based chemotherapy alone in cohort G. We explored the relationship between TMB and outcomes in KEYNOTE-021 cohorts C and G. All patients in cohort C received pembrolizumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed. Patients in cohort G were randomized 1:1 to pembrolizumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed or carboplatin and pemetrexed alone. TMB was determined by whole-exome sequencing of tumor and matched normal DNA. Association of TMB (continuous, log10 transformed) with outcomes for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone were assessed using logistic regression for ORR and Cox proportional hazards models for PFS and OS adjusted for ECOG PS; statistical significance was determined at the 0.05 level without multiplicity adjustment. The correlation of TMB (continuous, log10 transformed)<sep>578 Background: GSK-3β overexpression is associated with worse prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in PDAC. GSK-3β inhibition reverses chemotherapy-resistance by inhibiting chemotherapy-induced, ATR-mediated, DNA damage response. 9-ING-41 has significant anti-tumor activity through apoptosis induction, anti-fibrotic activity and NK/T-cell effector stimulation. We hypothesized that 9-ING-41 in combination with GnP chemotherapy would lead to anti-tumor activity, with improved tumor responses in patients with advanced PDAC in the first line setting. Methods: Primary endpoint is disease control rate (DCR). DCR = confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) ≥ 16 weeks (wks). Secondary endpoints are safety and ORR (overall response rates). Eligibility: Advanced PDAC, ECOG PS 0-2, no prior therapy in the metastatic setting and no systemic therapy in prior 6 months.

Recently, immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical activity in extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). The CASPIAN trial assessed durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-etoposide) in treatment-naive patients with ES-SCLC.This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial was done at 209 sites across 23 countries. Eligible patients were adults with untreated ES-SCLC, with WHO performance status 0 or 1 and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide; or platinum-etoposide alone. All drugs were administered intravenously. Platinum-etoposide consisted of etoposide 80-100 mg/m2 on days 1-3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5-6 mg/mL per min or<sep>3008 Background: TAPUR is a phase II basket study evaluating anti-tumor activity of commercially available targeted agents in pts with advanced cancers with genomic alterations. Results in a cohort of pts with solid tumors with BRAF V600E/D/K/R mutation (mut) treated with C+V are reported. Methods: Eligible pts had advanced solid tumors, no standard treatment (tx) options, measurable disease, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function. Genomic testing was performed in CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited site selected labs. Pts matched to C+V had various solid tumors with BRAF V600E/D/K/R mut, or other BRAF mut if approved by the Molecular Tumor Board, and no MAP2K1/2, MEK1/2, NRAS mut.

First, we use the deflated continuation technique of bifurcation analysis to explore its complex energy landscape, characterized by multiple bifurcations from which stable and unstable branches emanate. We then investigate how this landscape can be used to design materials with advanced programmability. We find that the response of the system can be constantly reprogrammed through local manipulation, moving it from one stable branch to another,<sep>Many physical systems can be studied as collections of particles embedded in space, evolving through deterministic evolution equations. Natural questions arise concerning how to characterize these arrangements - are they ordered or disordered? If they are ordered, how are they ordered and what kinds of defects do they possess? Originally introduced to study problems in pure mathematics, Voronoi tessellations have become a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing countless problems in pure and applied physics. In this paper we explain the basics of<sep>We propose a dimensionless bendability parameter, $\\epsilon^{-1} = [\\left(h/W\\right)^2 T^{-1}]^{-1}$ for wrinkling of thin, twisted ribbons with thickness $h$, width $W$, and tensional strain $T$. Bendability permits efficient collapse of data for wrinkle onset, wavelength, critical stress, and residual stress, demonstrating longitudinal wrinkling's primary dependence on this parameter. This new parameter also allows us to distinguish the highly bendable range ($\\epsilon^{-1} > 20$) from moderately bendable samples ($\\epsilon^{-1} \\in (0,20]$).

Multi-threaded parallel computing is implemented throughout the meshing procedure, making it suitable for fast generation of large-scale meshes.

We compare the performance of the three meshing methods in TriMe++, and show that the hybrid method retains the advantages of the other two. The<sep>Shape optimization is used to design flexible mechanical metamaterials. We employ the higher-order moving-mesh method to arbitrarily parameterize the geometries and tune their nonlinear mechanical response to our liking under different loading conditions. Rather than considering periodic unit cells, we focus on finite size elastomeric sheets with an embedded array of pores subjected to uniaxial tension, compression, and shear and use the optimization algorithm to tune either their stress–strain response or their effective Poisson’s ratio. We find that for all considered targets the<sep>We present a general simulation approach for incompressible fluid–structure interactions in a fully Eulerian framework using the reference map technique. The approach is suitable for modeling one or more rigid or finitely deformable objects or soft objects with rigid components interacting with the fluid and with each other.

Viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are typically spared in this process, but the mechanisms of target selectivity during host shutoff remain poorly understood. Using transcriptome-wide and targeted reporter experiments, we demonstrate that the influenza A virus endoribonuclease PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. Proximity-labeling proteomics reveals that PA-X interacts with cellular RNA processing proteins, some of which are partially required for host shutoff.<sep>This chapter explores two distinct ideas. The first is relaxation, that is, the successive adjustment of small subsets of unknowns using tentative values for the other unknowns. The second idea is searching. Here, one constructs successive approximations in multidimensional Euclidean space by marching in directions determined by optimization criteria.

The chapter uses most of the concepts only in discussing<sep>Abstract Widespread shutoff of host gene expression through RNA degradation is an advantageous way for many viruses to block antiviral responses. However, viruses still need to maintain expression of their own genes and host genes necessary for replication. The influenza A virus host shutoff endoribonuclease PA-X solves this problem by sparing viral mRNAs and some host RNAs. To understand how PA-X distinguishes between RNAs, we characterized PA-X cut sites transcriptome-wide. This analysis shows that PA-Xs from multiple influenza strains cleave RNAs at GCUG<sep>In this work, we present a method for simulating the large-scale deformation and crumpling of thin, elastoplastic sheets. Motivated by the physical behavior of thin sheets during crumpling, two different formulations of the governing equations of motion are used: (1) a quasistatic formulation that effectively describes smooth deformations, and (2) a fully dynamic formulation that captures large changes in the sheet's velocity. The former is a differential-algebraic system of equations integrated implicitly in time, while the latter is a set of ordinary differential<sep>Molecular dynamics simulations frequently employ periodic boundary conditions where the positions of the periodic images are manipulated in order to apply deformation to the material sample. For example, Lees-Edwards conditions use moving periodic images to apply simple shear. Here, we examine the problem of precisely comparing this type of simulation to continuum solid mechanics. We employ a hypoelastoplastic mechanical model, and develop a projection method to enforce quasistatic equilibrium.

The RMT is a fully Eulerian FSI numerical method that allows fluids and large-deformation elastic solids to be represented on a single fixed computational grid. This eliminates the need for meshing complex geometries typical in other FSI approaches and greatly simplifies the coupling between fluid and solids.

We show that traditional multigrid coarsening of the primal formulation leads to poor and suboptimal multigrid performance, whereas coarsening of the flux formulation leads to essentially optimal convergence and is equivalent to a purely geometric multigrid method. The resulting operator-coarsening schemes do not require the entire mesh hierarchy to be explicitly built, thereby obviating<sep>Knitting interloops one-dimensional yarns into three-dimensional fabrics that exhibit behaviours beyond their constitutive materials. How extensibility and anisotropy emerge from the hierarchical organisation of yarns into knitted fabrics has long been unresolved.

This physically validated model captures the fundamental mechanical response of knitted fabrics, analogous to flexible metamaterials and biological fiber networks due to geometric nonlinearity<sep>In this two-part paper, we extend to three dimensions a new projection method for simulating hypo-elastoplastic solids in the quasi-static limit. The method is based on a surprising mathematical correspondence to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, where the projection method of Chorin (1968) is an established numerical technique. In both parts, we explore the method through numerical simulation of a three-dimensional continuum-level elastoplastic model of a bulk metallic glass, based on the shear transformation zone (STZ) theory of amorphous plasticity.

The population generically consists of multiple competing strains, a phenomenon known as clonal interference. Microscopic epistasis and clonal interference are central aspects of evolution in microbes, but their combined effects on the functional form of the population’s mean fitness are poorly understood. Here, we develop a computational method that resolves the full microscopic complexity of a simulated evolving population subject to a standard serial dilution<sep>Many viruses block host gene expression to take over the infected cell. This process, termed host shutoff, is thought to promote viral replication by preventing antiviral responses and redirecting cellular resources to viral processes. Several viruses from divergent families accomplish host shutoff through RNA degradation by endoribonucleases. However, viruses also need to ensure expression of their own genes.

The cellular behaviors underlying blastoderm formation are varied and poorly understood. In most insects, the pre-blastoderm embryo is a syncytium: nuclei divide and move throughout the shared cytoplasm, ultimately reaching the cortex. In Drosophila melanogaster, some early nuclear movements result from pulsed cytoplasmic flows that are coupled to synchronous divisions.

The cylindrical geometry allows us to examine growth in the absence of Gaussian curvature but in the presence of a closure constraint—the requirement that a crystal loops back onto itself. In some cases, this constraint results in structures that have been observed previously in theory and nonequilibrium packing experiments: chiral crystals and crystals with linear defects known as “line slips”. More generally, though,<sep>Topological materials discovery has emerged as an important frontier in condensed matter physics. While theoretical classification frameworks such as topological quantum chemistry have been used to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental determination of materials' topology often poses significant technical challenges.

Global high-resolution observations of atmospheric composition from satellites can greatly improve our understanding of surface emissions through inverse analyses. Variational inverse methods can optimize surface emissions at any resolution but do not readily quantify the error and information content of the posterior solution.

An increasing number of swine infections are caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella strains, many of which have entered, and continue to enter the human food chain.<sep>This chapter discusses application of natural parasites of bacteria, bacteriophages (phages), as a promising biological control for Salmonella in poultry and swine. Many studies have shown phages can be applied at different points from farm-to-fork, from pre to post slaughter, to control the spread of Salmonella in the food chain. Pre-slaughter applications include administering phages via oral gavage, in drinking water and in feed. Post slaughter applications include adding phages to carcasses and during packaging of meat products. The research discussed in this chapter demonstrate a set of promising data that relate to the ability of phages to reduce Salmonella colonisation and abundance. Collectively the studies support the viability of phage as antimicrobial prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent and control Salmonella in the food chain.<sep>Infections caused by multidrug resistant Salmonella strains are problematic in swine and are entering human food chains. Bacteriophages (phages) could be used to complement or replace antibiotics to reduce infection within swine. Here, we extensively characterised six broad host range lytic Salmonella phages, with the aim of developing a phage cocktail to prevent or treat infection. Intriguingly, the phages tested differed by one to five single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, there were clear phenotypic differences between them, especially in their heat and pH sensitivity. In vitro killing assays were conducted to determine the efficacy of phages alone and when combined, and three cocktails reduced bacterial numbers by ~2 × 103 CFU/mL within two hours. These cocktails were tested in larvae challenge studies, and prophylactic treatment with phage cocktail SPFM10-SPFM14 was the most efficient. Phage treatment improved larvae survival to 90% after 72 h versus 3% in the infected untreated group. In 65% of the phage-treated larvae, Salmonella counts were below the detection limit, whereas it was isolated from 100% of the infected, untreated larvae group. This study demonstrates that phages effectively reduce Salmonella colonisation in larvae, which supports their ability to similarly protect swine.<sep>A common cause of human food poisoning is through ingestion of pork products contaminated with Salmonella spp. Worryingly multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella strains have been isolated from pigs, which motivates the need for alternative antimicrobials. In this study isolation and characterization of 21 lytic Salmonella phages is described. All 21 phages, labeled as SPFM phages were shown to efficiently infect MDR Salmonella strains isolated from United Kingdom pigs and phages SPFM1, SPFM3, SPFM10, SPFM14, SPFM15, SPFM17, and SPFM19 could lyse 100% of strains tested. The phage genome sizes range from 233 to 242 Kb, which qualifies them as jumbo phages. All SPFM phage genomes are approximately 95% similar to each other by average nucleotide identity, they encode between 258-307 coding sequences and share 188 core genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows these phages are most similar to phages of the genus Seoulvirus and to further characterize phages within the genus, genes under positive selection were identified. Several of the genes under evolutionary selection pressure were predicted to encode for proteins that interact with bacteria. We describe the phenotypic and genetic characterization of this novel Salmonella phage set. As the phages efficiently kill MDR Salmonella strains, they may offer a promising alternative to antibiotics.<sep>Introductory Paragraph Phage-bacterial recognition is species-specific, determined by interactions between phage receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) and corresponding bacterial receptors. RBPs are diverse and we present data demonstrating the identification and characterisation of a novel C. difficile phage RBP. Putative RBP were identified for CDHS-1 and overexpressed, purified, and polyclonal antibodies were raised and used in phage neutralization assays. Anti-gp22 neutralised CDHS-1, indicating it is the RBP. Immunogold-labelling and transmission electron microscopy confirmed this enabling visualization of the protein locations. A detailed structural understanding was obtained from determining the three-dimensional structure of gp22 by X-ray crystallography. gp22 is a new RBP class consisting of an N-terminal L-shaped α-helical superhelix domain and a C-terminal Mg 2+ -binding domain. The protein is a stable homodimer in solution mediated via reciprocal contacts between an α-helical hairpin, located within the superhelix domain and additional asymmetrical contacts between the ends of the short arm of each L-shaped protomer. The dimer resembles U-shape with a crossbar formed from the hairpin of each partner. C. difficile binding is Mg 2+ -dependent. CDHS-1 could not infect a C. difficile S-layer mutant suggesting the bacterial receptors are within the S-layer. These findings provide novel insights into phage biology and extend our knowledge of RBPs.<sep>Abstract As natural bacterial predators, bacteriophages have the potential to be developed to tackle antimicrobial resistance, but our exploitation of them is limited by understanding their vast uncharacterised genetic diversity 1,2 . Fascinatingly, this genetic diversity reflects many ways that phages can make proteins, performing similar functions that together form the familiar phage particle. Critical to infection are phage receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind bacterial ‘receptors’ and initiate bacterial entry 3 . Here we identified and characterised Gp22, a novel RBP for phage CDHS-1 that infects pathogenic C. difficile , but that had no recognisable RBPs. We showed that Gp22 antibodies neutralised CDHS-1 infection and used immunogold-labelling and transmission electron microscopy to identify their location on the capsid. The Gp22 three-dimensional structure was resolved by X-ray crystallography revealing a new RBP class with an N-terminal L-shaped α-helical superhelix domain and a C-terminal Mg 2+ -binding domain. The findings provide novel insights into C. difficile phage biology and phage-host interactions. This will facilitate optimal phage development and future engineering strategies 4,5 . Furthermore, the AlphaFold2-predicted Gp22 structure, which was strikingly accurate, paves the way for a structurome based transformation and guidance of future phage studies where many proteins lack sequence homology but have recognisable protein structures.<sep>Clostridioides difficile causes antibiotic-induced diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis in humans and animals. Current conventional treatment relies solely on antibiotics, but C. difficile infection (CDI) cases remain persistently high with concomitant increased recurrence often due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Antibiotics used in treatment also induce gut microbial imbalance; therefore, novel therapeutics with improved target specificity are being investigated. Bacteriophages (phages) kill bacteria with precision, hence are alternative therapeutics for the targeted eradication of the pathogen. Here, we review current progress in C. difficile phage research. We discuss tested strategies of isolating C. difficile phages directly, and via enrichment methods from various sample types and through antibiotic induction to mediate prophage release. We also summarise phenotypic phage data that reveal their morphological, genetic diversity, and various ways they impact their host physiology and pathogenicity during infection and lysogeny. Furthermore, we describe the therapeutic development of phages through efficacy testing in different in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo infection models. We also discuss genetic modification of phages to prevent horizontal gene transfer and improve lysis efficacy and formulation to enhance stability and delivery of the phages. The goal of this review is to provide a more in-depth understanding of C. difficile phages and theoretical and practical knowledge on pre-clinical, therapeutic evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of phage therapy for CDI.<sep>Nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. are a leading cause of human gastrointestinal infections and are commonly transmitted via the consumption of contaminated meat. To limit the spread of Salmonella and other food-borne pathogens in the food chain, bacteriophage (phage) therapy could be used during rearing or pre-harvest stages of animal production. This study was conducted to determine if a phage cocktail delivered in feed is capable of reducing Salmonella colonization in experimentally challenged chickens and to determine the optimal phage dose. A total of 672 broilers were divided into six treatment groups T1 (no phage diet and unchallenged); T2 (phage diet 106 PFU/day); T3 (challenged group); T4 (phage diet 105 PFU/day and challenged); T5 (phage diet 106 PFU/day and challenged); and T6 (phage diet 107 PFU/day and challenged). The liquid phage cocktail was added to mash diet with ad libitum access available throughout the study. By day 42 (the concluding day of the study), no Salmonella was detected in faecal samples collected from group T4. Salmonella was isolated from a small number of pens in groups T5 (3/16) and T6 (2/16) at ∼4 × 102 CFU/g. In comparison, Salmonella was isolated from 7/16 pens in T3 at ∼3 × 104 CFU/g. Phage treatment at all three doses had a positive impact on growth performance in challenged birds with increased weight gains in comparison to challenged birds with no phage diet. We showed delivering phages via feed was effective at reducing Salmonella colonization in chickens and our study highlights phages offer a promising tool to target bacterial infections in poultry.<sep>Salmonella spp. is a leading cause of gastrointestinal enteritis in humans where it is largely contracted via contaminated poultry and pork. Phages can be used to control Salmonella infection in the animals, which could break the cycle of infection before the products are accessible for consumption. Here, the potential of 21 myoviruses and a siphovirus to eliminate Salmonella in vitro and in vivo was examined with the aim of developing a biocontrol strategy to curtail the infection in poultry and swine. Together, the phages targeted the twenty-three poultry and ten swine prevalent Salmonella serotype isolates tested. Although individual phages significantly reduced bacterial growth of representative isolates within 6 h post-infection, bacterial regrowth occurred 1 h later, indicating proliferation of resistant strains. To curtail bacteriophage resistance, a novel three-phage cocktail was developed in vitro , and further investigated in an optimized Galleria mellonella larva Salmonella infection model colonized with representative swine, chicken and laboratory strains. For all the strains examined, G. mellonella larvae given phages 2 h prior to bacterial exposure (prophylactic regimen) survived and Salmonella was undetectable 24 h post-phage treatment and throughout the experimental time (72 h). Administering phages with bacteria (co-infection), or 2 h post-bacterial exposure (remedial regimen) also improved survival (73–100% and 15–88%, respectively), but was less effective than prophylaxis application. These pre-livestock data support the future application of this cocktail for further development to effectively treat Salmonella infection in poultry and pigs. Future work will focus on cocktail formulation to ensure stability and incorporation into feeds and used to treat the infection in target animals.<sep>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem globally. The main bacterial organisms associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) associated sepsis are E. coli and Klebsiella along with Enterobacter species. These all have AMR strains known as ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase), which are featured on the WHO priority pathogens list as “critical” for research. Bacteriophages (phages), as viruses that can infect and kill bacteria, could provide an effective tool to tackle these AMR strains. There is currently no “gold standard” for developing a phage cocktail. Here we describe a novel approach to develop an effective phage cocktail against a set of ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella largely isolated from patients in United Kingdom hospitals. By comparing different measures of phage efficacy, we show which are the most robust, and suggest an efficient screening cascade that could be used to develop phage cocktails to target other AMR bacterial species. A target panel of 38 ESBL-producing clinical strains isolated from urine samples was collated and used to test phage efficacy. After an initial screening of 68 phages, six were identified and tested against these 38 strains to determine their clinical coverage and killing efficiency. To achieve this, we assessed four different methods to assess phage virulence across these bacterial isolates. These were the Direct Spot Test (DST), the Efficiency of Plating (EOP) assay, the planktonic killing assay (PKA) and the biofilm assay. The final ESBL cocktail of six phages could effectively kill 23/38 strains (61%), for Klebsiella 13/19 (68%) and for E. coli 10/19 (53%) based on the PKA data. The ESBL E. coli collection had six isolates from the prevalent UTI-associated ST131 sequence type, five of which were targeted effectively by the final cocktail. Of the four methods used to assess phage virulence, the data suggests that PKAs are as effective as the much more time-consuming EOPs and data for the two assays correlates well. This suggests that planktonic killing is a good proxy to determine which phages should be used in a cocktail. This assay when combined with the virulence index also allows “phage synergy” to inform cocktail design.</abstract>", "<keyword>Austerity<sep>Investment (military)<sep>Procurement<sep>Legislation<sep>Mandate<sep>Service (business)<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Climate change<sep>Flexibility (engineering)<sep>Pace<sep>Politics<sep>Relevance (law)<sep>Energy (signal processing)<sep>Local government<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>Corporate governance<sep>Value (mathematics)</keyword><title>Crisis and opportunity: Transforming climate governance for SMEs<sep>Facilitating application of the energy service concept: Development of an analytical framework<sep>Value for Money: Local Authority Action on Clean Energy for Net Zero<sep>Local decarbonisation opportunities and barriers: UK public procurement legislation<sep>Governing low carbon and inclusive transitions in the city: a case study of Nottingham, UK</title><abstract>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are key actors in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Their aggregate emissions are significant, and they are disproportionately affected by climate impacts, including extreme weather events. SMEs also play a vital role in shaping the environmental behaviours of individuals, communities, and other businesses. However, these organisations have been largely neglected by climate policies across all levels of government. A series of global crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Europe and the Middle East, and energy price spikes, have posed an existential threat to millions of SMEs, while also acting as a catalyst for the reconfiguration of the social contract between business, society and the state, both temporary and more long-term. In this article, we make the case for increased focus on the governance of SME decarbonisation to address this turbulent context. We outline key challenges facing public policymakers and other governance actors, compare strategic options, identify evidence gaps that hinder effective interventions, and highlight implications for research. In doing so we set out key elements of a renewed social contract for business, society and state relations.<sep>It is widely acknowledged that the servitisation of energy retail has the potential to reduce costs and environmental impact. However, there persists a limited awareness of what market activities the energy service concept can translate into, especially in Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES). In this paper an analytical framework is developed, tested, and applied to help clarify the energy service concept, assess where its application is most appropriate in such systems, and facilitate a more strategic approach to value creation at both household and systems level to support the transition to net zero. First, we develop it through a content analysis of the energy service field's most cited papers. Second, we test its boundaries at household level through a round of interviews. Third, we demonstrate its relevance at the energy systems level by applying it in two SLES contexts. Its application revealed that focusing on value creation through material-centric energy services alone is unviable while their coordinated integration into SLES involving centralised data-centric activities creates a potential business case around network reinforcement savings and flexibility provision. For the energy service concept to succeed in the residential sector, contractual service offerings require place-based energy system integration to align with network characteristics.<sep>Local authorities are well placed to realise co-benefits of integrated local energy systems; however, in the UK they have no statutory energy mandate. Planning and developing clean energy are discretionary, and persistent budget reductions, combined with the lack of strategic direction from the UK government for more localised energy provision, limit local capacity, expertise and resources. Nevertheless, some local authorities have led energy initiatives but have been unable to stimulate investment at the pace and scale required to align with net zero greenhouse gas targets. Using evidence from such initiatives, this paper discusses the institutional changes needed to enable local authorities to act. It examines existing climate and local energy plans, and their integral socio-economic value. Using this evidence, investment opportunities from locally led net zero programmes are identified. EU technical assistance funds provided a particularly successful route to local energy developments: based on value of investment secured against initial funding, it is estimated that GBP 1 million technical assistance funding to every local authority would lead to GBP 15 billion investment in local energy. Other potential funding innovations are assessed and the paper concludes with recommendations for policy and resource measures needed to convert local ambition into clean energy and energy saving investment at scale.<sep>Significant changes in public procurement are underway in the UK. Post-Brexit, the UK government is in the process of modifying the procurement rulebook. The new regime will be guided by the procurement strategy priorities of social value, jobs and net zero; however, the new approach to procurement foresees minimal rules and significant guidance. This paper explores implications of changing procurement legislation on the delivery of net zero at a local level in the UK. Particular focus lies on the many contracting authorities, such as county, city and district councils, that have declared climate emergencies and ambitions to decarbonise. Two case studies depicting the procurement of local net zero solutions, one on the Energy Efficient Scotland Programme and the other on place-based finance instruments, such as community municipal investments (CMIs), are used to identify existing opportunities and barriers to procure local net zero solutions with a particular focus on institutional governance. This paper concludes with a set of questions that need to be addressed to ensure that the changes to public procurement legislation are understood and that the institutional governance of intermediation can lead to outcomes that balance economic, social and environmental considerations across multiple scales. <em><strong><br /></strong></em> <em><strong>Practice relevance</strong></em> <em><strong></strong></em>The absence of a rich approach to multilevel governance in the UK means that procurement is one of the few options currently available to many local authorities to deliver net zero at the local level. Given the scale of investments necessary to reach net zero, institutional governance is necessary to align top-down procurement and bottom-up finance with many other laws, policies and regulations. This paper explores the implications of changing procurement legislation on the delivery of net zero at a local level. Two case studies depicting the procurement of local net zero solutions (the Energy Efficient Scotland Programme and place-based finance instruments, <em>e.g.</em> CMIs) are used to identify existing opportunities and barriers to procure local net zero solutions. Guidance on understanding public procurement legislation is provided to ensure that the institutional governance of intermediation can lead to outcomes that balance economic, social and environmental considerations (especially decarbonisation) across multiple scales.<sep>This thesis critically examines the extent to which low carbon and equitable transitions are being achieved within urban areas in advanced economies. It draws on Nottingham as a single case study of a pioneering transition city in the UK context, with strong ambitions to become the UK’s first carbon neutral city by 2028. Nottingham is a compelling example for examining what can be achieved in practice by an English unitary authority, and what constraints are experienced by local actors that inhibit urban sustainable trajectories. Using a qualitative research design, I examine the key governing actors involved and their agency, the barriers and tensions encountered in their pursuits, and the approaches and pathways undertaken for progressing low carbon and equitable urban transitions. This thesis critically engages with academic ideas and political debate on sustainable transitions. Specifically, I use a multi-scalar perspective to investigate the actors involved in low carbon transitions, and by doing so, I draw upon multiple theories and perspectives to examine the governance of sustainable transitions (e.g. Avelino & Wittmayer, 2016; Geels, 2005; Kern & Alber, 2009). Whilst analysing urban transition processes particularly in the context of neoliberal austerity (e.g. Hodson & Marvin, 2015; Peck, 2012), I constructively engage with literature surrounding just transitions, and the ways in which sustainable pathways are also inclusive and equitable, focusing on the concepts of energy and transport justice (e.g. Jenkins et al.2017; McCauley & Heffron, 2018; Mullen & Marsden, 2016). In this research I turn to the concepts of path-dependency, path creation and lock-in to analyse the approaches and pathways taken by urban actors for implementing low carbon and inclusive transitions, and to further explain past, present and future sustainable urban trajectories (e.g. MacKinnon et al.2019; Unruh, 2000). Beginning with a multi-level policy analysis, I reflect that climate change targets are weak, inconsistent and have omitted attention to social equity issues. As a result, low carbon and just transitions are insufficiently addressed in international policy, which in turn has constrained implementing national and local level climate change policy. From a national level, there are inconsistent and disruptive policy environments which are hindering low carbon urban just transitions, and I draw upon the context of national austerity, ambivalence of inclusive climate change policy and ineffective regulation. Barriers are also emerging because of local level contestation and demonstrate the more context-specific and spatial nature of urban transitions. Finally, I attend to the Nottingham example to reveal how agency and political capacity are particularly influenced by the type and size of local authority and actors in power. Lastly, I argue that the municipal ownership of energy and transport systems in the city has been imperative for political capacity to enact low carbon and just urban transitions.</abstract>", "<keyword>Pancreatectomy<sep>Pancreaticoduodenectomy<sep>Audit<sep>Quality of life (healthcare)<sep>Esophageal cancer<sep>Cancer<sep>Confidence interval<sep>Clinical audit<sep>Lymphadenectomy<sep>Pancreatic cancer<sep>Carcinoma<sep>Esophagectomy<sep>Population<sep>Body mass index<sep>Enucleation<sep>Retrospective cohort study<sep>Prospective cohort study<sep>Odds ratio<sep>Logistic regression<sep>Amylase<sep>Randomized controlled trial<sep>Area under the curve<sep>Lymph node<sep>Distal pancreatectomy<sep>Fistula<sep>Cohort<sep>Pancreatic fistula</keyword><title>Intraoperative fistula risk score (iFRS) in pancreatoduodenectomy: development and validation in three datasets<sep>Nationwide prospective audit of pancreatic surgery: design, accuracy, and outcomes of the Dutch pancreatic cancer audit<sep>Randomized clinical trial and meta-analysis of the impact of a fibrin sealant patch on pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy: CPR trial<sep>The role of abdominal drainage in pancreatic resection – A multicenter validation for early drain removal<sep>Alternative Fistula Risk Score for Pancreatoduodenectomy (a-FRS)<sep>The role of abdominal drainage in pancreatic resection – A multicenter validation study for early drain removal<sep>Distribution of lymph node metastases in esophageal carcinoma [TIGER study]: study protocol of a multinational observational study<sep>Outcome including long-term quality of life after total pancreatectomy (Panorama): A nationwide cohort study</title><abstract>Background: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains one of the most threatening complications after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). Current risk scores, such as the Fistula Risk Score, predict the risk of POPF after surgery, whereas decisions on drain placement and the use of somatostatin analogues have to be made intraoperatively. We therefore aimed to develop an intraoperative fistula risk score (i-FRS). Methods: We included patients after PD from three databases. The nationwide Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Audit (18 centers) between 2014-2016, the University Hospital Southampton NHS between 2007-2016, and an international database (17 centers, between 2001-2016). POPF was defined as ISGPF grade B/C fistula. Missing data were imputed with multiple imputation (five times). A prediction model was developed by multivariable logistic regression modelling. Results: 3,955 patients were included with 640 (16%) patients developing POPF. Three predictors were strongly associated with POPF: soft pancreatic texture (odds ratio: 3.88), small pancreatic duct diameter (continuous, odds ratio 0.77), and high Body Mass Index (BMI) (continuous, odds ratio 1.05). Discrimination of the model showed a c-statistic of 0.72. Cross-validation revealed the following C-statistics: 0.72 (DPCA), 0.74 (Southampton), 0.71 (international). An online calculator is available at pancreascalculator.com. Conclusion: The i-FRS allows for intraoperative prediction of POPF based on pancreatic texture, ductal diameter, and BMI.<sep>Background: Auditing is an important tool to identify practice variation and 'best practices'. The Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Audit (DPCA) is mandatory in all 18 Dutch centers for pancreatic surgery. We present the design, outcomes, and accuracy of this prospective nationwide audit. Methods: Performance indicators and casemix factors were identified by a PubMed search for RCTs and large series in pancreatic surgery. Data dictionaries of two national audits, three major pancreatic centers, and the national cancer registry were evaluated. Morbidity, mortality, and length of stay were analyzed in all pancreatic resections registered during two audit years. Case ascertainment was cross-checked with the Dutch healthcare inspectorate and key variables validated in all centers. Results: Sixteen RCTs and three large series were found. Sixteen indicators and 20 casemix factors were included in the audit. During 2014-2015, 1,785 pancreatic resections were registered including 1,345 pancreatoduodenectomies (PD). Diagnosis was pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 39% of cases. In-hospital mortality was 3.6%. Following PD, mortality was 4.1%, Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3 morbidity was 29.9% and median (IQR) length of stay 12 (9-18) days. In total 97.2% of >40,000 variables validated were consistent with the medical charts. Conclusion: The DPCA, with high quality data, reports good outcomes of pancreatic surgery on a national level. The audit facilitates nationwide and international comparison of outcomes and identification of best practices.<sep>Abstract Background Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains the main cause of morbidity in patients after distal pancreatectomy. The objective of this study was to investigate whether an absorbable fibrin sealant patch could prevent POPF after distal pancreatectomy. Methods A multicentre, patient-blinded, parallel-group randomized superiority trial was performed in seven Dutch hospitals. Allocation was done using a computer-generated randomization list with a 1 : 1 allocation ratio and concealed varying permuted block sizes. Pancreatic stump closure with a fibrin patch was compared with standard treatment in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy. The primary endpoint was the development of grade B/C POPF. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed which combined the present findings with all available evidence. Results Between October 2010 and August 2017, 247 patients were enrolled. Fifty-four patients (22.2 per cent) developed a POPF, 25 of 125 patients in the patch group versus 29 of 122 in the control group (20.0 versus 23.8 per cent; P = 0·539). No related adverse effects were observed. In the meta-analysis, no significant difference was seen between the patch and control groups (19.7 versus 22.0 per cent; odds ratio 0.89, 95 per cent c.i. 0.60 to 1.32; P = 0·556). Conclusion Application of a fibrin patch to the pancreatic stump does not reduce the incidence of POPF in distal pancreatectomy. Future studies should focus on alternative fistula mitigation strategies, considering pancreatic neck thickness and duct size as risk factors. Trial registration number NL5876 (Netherlands Trial Registry).<sep>Background: Abdominal drainage in patients undergoing pancreatic resection is under debate. Several studies showed contradictive and inconclusive results. Bassi et al. concluded that patients with a drain amylase of < 5000U/L on POD1 have a low risk for clinical relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) which would allow safe early drain removal.[1] We aimed to verify this algorithm retrospectively in a large Dutch cohort. Methods: The national DPCA database was used containing 1402 patients who underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy or enucleation. Data on post-operative drain amylase levels and timing of drain removal were collected in 13 hospitals. Univariate and multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model were performed. The primary outcome measure was grade B/C pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) as defined by the ISGPF. Results: 8.0% of the patients with a drain amylase level of < 5000U/L during the first 3 post-operative days developed a CR-POPF. When using a cut-off point of 2000U/L or 1000U/L, this was respectively 5.8% and 4.6% (n = 223;p < 0.001). Drain removal on POD4 or beyond was associated with more complications (p = 0.004). Drain amylase was shown to be the most significant predicting factor for CR-POPF (Wald = 43;p < 0.001). Conclusion: Similar to previous studies, our data support that early drain removal after pancreatic resection may be advantageous. The algorithm proposed by Bassi resulted however in a relatively high level of 8% CR-POPF.

Primary outcome was grade B/C POPF according to the 2005 International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definition. The score was externally validated in 2 independent databases (University Hospital of Verona and University Hospital of Pennsylvania), using both 2005 and 2016 ISGPS definitions. The a-FRS was also compared with the original-FRS.For model design, 1924 patients were included of whom 12% developed POPF. Three predictors were strongly associated with POPF: soft pancreatic texture [odds ratio (OR) 2.58, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.80-3.69], small pancreatic duct diameter (per mm increase, OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.61-0.76), and high body mass index (BMI) (per kg/m increase, OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04-1.11). Discrimination was adequate with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71-0.78) after internal validation, and 0.78 (0.74-0.82) after external validation. The predictive capacity of a-FRS was comparable with the original-FRS, both for the 2005 definition (AUC 0.78 vs 0.75, P = 0.03), and 2016 definition (AUC 0.72 vs 0.70, P = 0.05).The a-FRS predicts POPF after pancreatoduodenectomy based on 3 easily available variables (pancreatic texture, duct diameter, BMI) without blood loss and pathology, and was successfully validated for both the 2005 and 2016 POPF definition. The online calculator is available at www.pancreascalculator.com.<sep>Abdominal drainage and the timing of drain removal in patients undergoing pancreatic resection are under debate. Early drain removal after pancreatic resection has been reported to be safe with a low risk for clinical relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) when drain amylase on POD1 is < 5000U/L. The aim of this study was to validate this algorithm in a large national cohort. Patients registered in the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Audit (2014–2016) who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy or enucleation were analysed. Data on post-operative drain amylase levels, drain removal, postoperative pancreatic fistulae were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model were performed. The primary outcome measure was grade B/C pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF). Among 1402 included patients, 433 patients with a drain fluid amylase level of <5000U/L on POD1, 7% developed a CR-POPF. For patients with an amylase level >5000U/L the CR-POPF rate was 28%. When using a cut-off point of 2000U/L or 1000U/L during POD1-3, the CR-POPF rates were 6% and 5% respectively. For patients with an amylase level of >2000U/L and >1000UL during POD 1–3 the CR-POPF rates were 26% and 22% respectively (n = 223). Drain removal on POD4 or thereafter was associated with more complications (p = 0.004). Drain amylase level was shown to be the most statistically significant predicting factor for CR-POPF (Wald = 49.7; p < 0.001). Our data support early drain removal after pancreatic resection. However, a cut-off of 5000U/L drain amylase on POD1 was associated with a relatively high CR-POPF rate of 7%. A cut-off point of 1000U/L during POD1-3 resulted in 5% CR-POPF and might be a safer alternative.<sep>An important parameter for survival in patients with esophageal carcinoma is lymph node status. The distribution of lymph node metastases depends on tumor characteristics such as tumor location, histology, invasion depth, and on neoadjuvant treatment. The exact distribution is unknown. Neoadjuvant treatment and surgical strategy depends on the distribution pattern of nodal metastases but consensus on the extent of lymphadenectomy has not been reached. The aim of this study is to determine the distribution of lymph node metastases in patients with resectable esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction carcinoma in whom a transthoracic esophagectomy with a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy is performed. This can be the foundation for a uniform worldwide staging system and establishment of the optimal surgical strategy for esophageal cancer patients.The TIGER study is an international observational cohort study with 50 participating centers. Patients with a resectable esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction carcinoma in whom a transthoracic esophagectomy with a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy is performed in participating centers will be included. All lymph node stations will be excised and separately individually analyzed by pathological examination. The aim is to include 5000 patients. The primary endpoint is the distribution of lymph node metastases in esophageal and esophago-gastric junction carcinoma specimens following transthoracic esophagectomy with at least 2-field lymphadenectomy in relation to tumor histology, tumor location, invasion depth, number of lymph nodes and lymph node metastases, pre-operative diagnostics, neo-adjuvant therapy and (disease free) survival.The TIGER study will provide a roadmap of the location of lymph node metastases in relation to tumor histology, tumor location, invasion depth, number of lymph nodes and lymph node metastases, pre-operative diagnostics, neo-adjuvant therapy and survival. Patient-tailored treatment can be developed based on these results, such as the optimal radiation field and extent of lymphadenectomy based on the primary tumor characteristics.NCT03222895 , date of registration: July 19th, 2017.<sep>Background: Total pancreatectomy (TP) is increasingly advised for main duct IPMN and other conditions, mostly based on data from single center high-volume centers. This advice is, however, frequently debated since data on postoperative outcome and long-term quality of life (QoL) after TP from large, nationwide series are lacking. This study assesses the short-term outcomes and long-term impact of total pancreatectomy (TP), including endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, on quality of life (QoL) and to compare these outcomes with a healthy population and patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study among adults who underwent TP between 2006 and 2016 in 17 Dutch centers. Included were patients undergoing an elective primary TP or elective completion TP (for disease recurrence). Emergency completion TP (n = 23, patients with QoL n = 5) was excluded. Postoperative outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. QoL was assessed cross-sectionally using six generic and disease-specific questionnaires and compared with reference data from the Dutch general population and patients with type 1 diabetes. Sensitivity analyses included assessment of QoL based on duration of follow-up (<3 or ≥3-year follow-up, including subgroups of 3-5 year or ≥5-year follow-up). These cut-off points were selected to create sufficiently large groups. Results: Overall, 148 patients after TP were included. The annual number of TP increased from 5 in 2006 to 32 in 2015 (P 5 years), representing a similar QoL. Conclusion: This first nationwide cohort study to assess outcome and QoL after TP found a 5% 30-day mortality and a marginally worse, but statistically significant, self-rated global health status compared to a Dutch reference population, including more symptoms and functional complaints. Diabetes-related distress, however, even with 3- and 5-year follow-up, was similar to patients with type 1 diabetes. These data enrich the information which can be provided to patients and their relatives to facilitate shared decision making when faced with the decision to undergo TP.</abstract>",

In particular, right‐angled Artin groups satisfy a question of Capovilla–Löh–Moraschini proposing an inequality between the amenable category and Farber's topological complexity.<sep>We propose a new newsvendor model with the focus theory of choice. Instead of calculating the expected utility, the model conceives that a retailer evaluates each order quantity by examining the most salient demand for him/her. The proposed model is a bilevel optimization problem with maximin upper and lower level programs that are nonsmooth. We derive the optimal order quantity and obtain the properties of the optimal solution. The proposed framework provides a new vehicle to handle newsvendor problems.<sep>We develop randomized matrix-free algorithms for estimating partial traces.

We exploit a natural experiment unique to the UK to explore the link between the adoption of the impairment-only regime and changes in the value-relevance and timeliness of goodwill-related accounting amounts. Our results suggest that goodwill impairment, in contrast to goodwill amortisation, is negatively associated with market values and that goodwill is value relevant in the year of purchase, but that<sep>The hexagon is the least-perimeter tile in the Euclidean plane for any given area. On hyperbolic surfaces, this \"isoperimetric\" problem differs for every given area, as solutions do not scale. Cox conjectured that a regular $k$-gonal tile with 120-degree angles is isoperimetric. For area $\\pi/3$, the regular heptagon has 120-degree angles and therefore tiles many hyperbolic surfaces. For other areas, we show the existence of many tiles but provide no conjectured optima. On closed hyperbolic surfaces, we verify via a reduction argument<sep>Abstract Whether an ecological community is controlled from above or below remains a popular framework that continues generating interesting research questions and takes on especially important meaning in agroecosystems.

However, compared to the large body of research in optimizing the adversarial training process, there are few investigations into how architecture components affect robustness, and they rarely constrain model capacity.

In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study on the robustness of DNN architecture components under fixed parameter budgets. Through our investigation, we distill 18<sep>A recent case report described an individual who was a homozygous carrier of the APOE3 Christchurch (APOE3ch) mutation and resistant to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caused by a PSEN1-E280A mutation. Whether APOE3ch contributed to the protective effect remains unclear. We generated a humanized APOE3ch knock-in mouse and crossed it to an amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque-depositing model. We injected AD-tau brain extract to investigate tau seeding and spreading in the presence or absence of amyloid.

In particular, Quadrature Fourier Features (QFF) derived from Gaussian quadrature rules have gained popularity in recent years due to their improved approximation accuracy and better calibrated uncertainty estimates compared to Random Fourier Feature (RFF) methods. However, a key limitation of QFF is that its performance can suffer from well-known pathologies related to highly oscillatory quadrature, resulting in mediocre approximation with limited features.

Due to our increasing understanding of the role the surrounding landscape plays in ecological processes, a detailed characterization of land cover, including both agricultural and natural habitats, is ever more important for both researchers and conservation practitioners. Unfortunately, in the United States, different types of land cover data are split across thematic datasets that emphasize agricultural or natural vegetation, but not both. To address this data gap and reduce duplicative efforts in geospatial processing, we merged two major datasets, the LANDFIRE<sep>Although there is extensive literature on robotic total intracorporeal anastomosis (TICA) for right colon resection, left total ICA using the da Vinci Xi robotic platform has only been described in short case series previously.

The present article addresses electronic monitoring programs for domestic violence/intimate partner violence, examining how mismatches may emerge during their implementation or later. Electronic monitoring programs aim to surveil and deter defendants facing domestic violence/intimate partner violence–related charges during court-supervised release, with the aim of enhancing victim safety. Analysis of qualitative and survey data from a national (US) study suggests that domestic violence/intimate partner violence–focused strategies reliant on surveillance technology may be prone to generating mismatches rooted in discrepancies between victims’ expectations, defendant risk profiles, and program operations. Policy implications of mismatches in victim-focused initiatives are considered.<sep>Mixed couples face more marital conflict than endogamous couples. Drawing on intersectional theory and narrative victimology, this study examines women’s accounts of abuse in mixed heterosexual Arab/Palestinian–Israeli Jewish intimate partnerships amid the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The narratives of 25 women formerly in an abusive relationship are the primary data, which are supplemented by a comprehensive list of calls seeking advice or intervention from a non-governmental organization (NGO) that assists women in mixed relationships, and the NGO’s recorded in-service training sessions during which social workers discuss clients’ plights and abuse exposure. Consistent with research on mixed couples, the women’s narratives connect their abuse to differences, dynamics, and tensions rooted in cultural, religious, and social beliefs and practices. Importantly, the narratives also highlight how the Israeli–Palestinian conflict amplifies and escalates the women’s abuse. Intersections of gender, religion, and nationality as well as life in a conflict zone critically affect the abuse dynamic the women experience. The article concludes with a discussion of the relevance of narrative victimology and political enmity for intersectional approaches to domestic violence.<sep>72 long form essays Criminology in the 21st century has gone global.

In this article, we provide a detailed practical guide to the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of common cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.

Recent studies by our group and others have examined genome-wide gene expression responses of fruit flies to individual highly abundant compounds found in noni responsible for the fruit's unique chemistry and toxicity. In order to relate these reductionist experiments to the gene expression responses to feeding on noni fruit itself, we fed rotten noni fruit to adult female D. sechellia and performed RNA-sequencing. Combining the reductionist and more wholistic approaches, we have identified candidate genes that may contribute to each individual compound and those that play a more general role in response to the fruit as a whole. Using the compound specific and general responses, we used transcription factor prediction analyses to identify the regulatory networks and specific regulators involved in the responses to each compound and the fruit itself. The identified genes and regulators represent the possible genetic mechanisms and biochemical pathways that contribute to toxin resistance and noni specialization in D. sechellia.<sep>Abstract Drosophila sechellia is an island endemic host specialist that has evolved to consume the toxic fruit of Morinda citrifolia , also known as noni fruit.

At present, it is not definitively known whether these clinical entities constitute a single pathological disease or whether these manifestations represent two distinct disease entities sharing inflammatory demyelination as a pathological feature. Here we show using a novel mouse model that CSF of primary progressive multiple sclerosis patients is unique in its capacity to induce motor disability and spinal cord pathology including demyelination, impaired remyelination, reactive astrogliosis and axonal damage. Notably, removal of immunoglobulin G from primary progressive multiple sclerosis CSF via filtration or immunodepletion attenuates its pathogenic capacity. Furthermore, injection of recombinant antibodies derived from primary progressive multiple sclerosis CSF recapitulates the pathology. Our findings suggest that the clinical and pathological features of primary progressive multiple sclerosis are antibody-mediated and pathogenically distinct from relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Our study has potentially important implications for the development of specific therapies for patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.<sep>This review article examines evidence supporting the use of oral therapies in treating idiopathic, actinic, and metabolically induced skin hyperpigmentation. A thorough review of the literature regarding oral treatments for hyperpigmentation was systematically conducted through PubMed. Keywords used in the primary search include \"Hyperpigmentation,\" \"Melanosis\" or \"Melasma,\" \"Lightening,\" \"Oral,\" and \"Therapeutics.\" The search was limited to the English language, and no timeframe restrictions were implemented. Numerous orally administered therapies have been proposed for the treatment of skin hyperpigmentation. There is an abundant body of literature demonstrating the efficacy of orally administered tranexamic acid, glutathione, isotretinoin, and proanthocyanidin. It is reasonable to expect that the most effective oral therapies will address known underlying causes of hyperpigmentation such as thyroid disease, diabetes, and hormonal imbalance. Improvement due to oral therapy of otherwise unresponsive skin hyperpigmentation or hyperpigmentation of unknown cause is less predictable. This review is limited by the strength of evidence contained within the available studies. Clinical studies investigating the treatments discussed within this article are limited in number, at times lack blinding in the study design, and are based on small sample sizes. Based on existing research, the most promising oral remedies for hyperpigmentation appear to be tranexamic acid, glutathione, isotretinoin, and proanthocyanidin. Additional studies to better establish safety and efficacy are necessary.<sep>Drosophila sechellia is a dietary specialist fruit fly that evolved from a generalist ancestor to specialize on the toxic fruit of Morinda citrifolia This species pair has been the subject of numerous studies where the goal has largely been to determine the genetic basis of adaptations associated with host specialization. Because one of the most striking features of M. citrifolia fruit is the production of toxic volatile compounds that kill insects, most genomic studies in D. sechellia to date have focused on gene expression responses to the toxic compounds in its food. In this study, we aim to identify new genes important for host specialization by profiling gene expression response to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). Recent work found it to be highly abundant in M. citrifolia, critical for reproductive success of D. sechellia, and supplementation of diet with the downstream pathway product dopamine can influence toxin resistance phenotypes in related species. Here we used a combination of functional genetics and genomics techniques to identify new genes that are important for D. sechellia ecological adaptation to this new niche. We show that L-DOPA exposure can affect toxin resistance phenotypes, identify genes with plastic responses to L-DOPA exposure, and functionally test an identified candidate gene. We found that knock-down of Esterase 6 (Est6) in a heterologous species alters toxin resistance suggesting Est6 may play an important role in D. sechellia host specialization.<sep>Immunosuppression following solid organ transplantation is a known risk factor for the development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) occurring in the posttransplant setting is rare, which has made comprehensive understanding of this disease challenging. This study aims to further characterize the spectrum of clinicopathologic features of CTCL in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR).A retrospective chart review was performed for SOTR who were diagnosed with CTCL at a multi-site academic medical center from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2013. Eight patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Data collected included patient demographics, transplanted organ, the time between transplant and CTCL diagnosis, clinical presentation and rash morphology, a histological subtype of CTCL, immunosuppression regimens, and patient status. Twelve diagnostic skin biopsies for five patients were examined and reviewed by a board-certified dermatopathologist.Six (75%) out of the eight patients were men, two (25%) were women, and the median age was 53 years. The median time from the date of transplant to the diagnosis of CTCL was 8.2 years. Transplanted organs included the liver (4), kidney (3), and heart (1). Clinical presentation varied from papulonodules, comedone-like lesions, intense pruritis, and scaly erythematous eruptions. The most common histologic presentation was folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF) (7/12). Epstein-Barr virus-in situ hybridization (EBV-ISH) was negative in all specimens.We emphasize the rarity of CTCL among SOTR. Although rare in the general population, the FMF subtype appears to be disproportionately seen in SOTR compared with other CTCL.<sep>Drosophila sechellia is a dietary specialist endemic to the Seychelles islands that has evolved to consume the fruit of Morinda citrifolia. When ripe, the fruit of M. citrifolia contains octanoic acid and hexanoic acid, two medium-chain fatty acid volatiles that deter and are toxic to generalist insects. Drosophila sechellia has evolved resistance to these volatiles allowing it to feed almost exclusively on this host plant. The genetic basis of octanoic acid resistance has been the focus of multiple recent studies, but the mechanisms that govern hexanoic acid resistance in D. sechellia remain unknown. To understand how D. sechellia has evolved to specialize on M. citrifolia fruit and avoid the toxic effects of hexanoic acid, we exposed adult D. sechellia, D. melanogaster and D. simulans to hexanoic acid and performed RNA sequencing comparing their transcriptional responses to identify D. sechellia specific responses. Our analysis identified many more genes responding transcriptionally to hexanoic acid in the susceptible generalist species than in the specialist D. sechellia. Interrogation of the sets of differentially expressed genes showed that generalists regulated the expression of many genes involved in metabolism and detoxification whereas the specialist primarily downregulated genes involved in the innate immunity. Using these data, we have identified interesting candidate genes that may be critically important in aspects of adaptation to their food source that contains high concentrations of HA. Understanding how gene expression evolves during dietary specialization is crucial for our understanding of how ecological communities are built and how evolution shapes trophic interactions.<sep>Abstract Drosophila sechellia is a dietary specialist endemic to the Seychelles islands that has evolved to consume the fruit of Morinda citrifolia .

The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview for nondermatologist clinicians, outlining skin cancer diagnosis, treatment pearls, and skin cancer prevention strategies as they relate to SOTRs. A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted through the MEDLINE database with search terms including organ transplantation, transplant recipient, skin cancer, cutaneous neoplasms, management, and therapies. The search was limited to the English language and dates ranging from January 1, 2011, to December 28, 2021. All studies were reviewed for inclusion. Skin cancer will develop in more than half of SOTRs at some point in their life, most often nonmelanoma skin cancer such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Melanoma and rarer cutaneous malignant neoplasms, such as Merkel cell carcinoma and Kaposi sarcoma, are also more frequent among SOTRs. A multidisciplinary effort at skin cancer screening and patient education is invaluable to prevent skin cancer-related morbidity and mortality in this population of patients. Reduction in immunosuppressive medications and surgical intervention are effective therapeutic approaches, and more novel systemic therapies including G protein-coupled receptor inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors are possible options when traditional treatment approaches are not feasible. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy, however, comes with the risk of allograft rejection. With a growing and aging SOTR population, it is essential that SOTRs have support from dermatologists and nondermatologists alike in skin cancer prevention and treatment.<sep>Abstract The underlying genetic basis of adaptive phenotypic changes is generally poorly understood, yet a growing number of case studies are beginning to shed light on important questions about the molecular nature and pleiotropy of such changes. We use Drosophila sechellia , a dietary specialist fruit fly that evolved to specialize on a single toxic host plant, Morinda citrifolia , as a model for adaptive phenotypic change and seek to determine the genetic basis of traits associated with host specialization in this species. The fruit of M. citrifolia is toxic to other drosophilids, primarily due to high levels of the defense chemical octanoic acid (OA), yet D. sechellia has evolved resistance to OA. Our prior work identified three Osiris family genes that reside in a fine‐mapped QTL for OA resistance: Osiris 6 ( Osi6 ), Osi7 , and Osi8 , which can alter OA resistance in adult D. melanogaster when knocked down with RNA interference suggesting they may contribute to OA resistance in D. sechellia . Genetic mapping identified overlapping genomic regions involved in larval and adult OA resistance in D. sechellia , yet it remains unknown whether Osiris genes contribute to resistance in both life stages. Furthermore, because multiple genomic regions contribute to OA resistance, we aim to identify other gene(s) involved in this adaptation. Here, we identify candidate larval OA resistance genes using RNA sequencing to measure genome‐wide differential gene expression in D. sechellia larvae after exposure to OA and functionally test identified genes for a role in OA resistance. We then test the Osiris genes previously shown to alter adult OA resistance for effects on OA resistance in larvae. We found that Osi8 knockdown decreased OA resistance in D. melanogaster larvae. These data suggest that evolved changes in Osi8 could impact OA resistance in multiple life stages while Osi6 and Osi7 may only impact adult resistance to OA.<sep>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron degeneration. Approximately 90% of cases occur sporadically with no known cause while 10% are familial cases arising from known inherited genetic mutations. In vivo studies have predominantly utilized transgenic models harbouring amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated gene mutations, which have not hitherto elucidated mechanisms underlying motor neuron death or identified therapeutic targets specific to sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here we provide evidence demonstrating pathogenic differences in CSF from patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with mutations in SOD1, C9orf72 and TARDBP. Using a novel CSF-mediated animal model, we show that intrathecal delivery of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient-derived CSF into the cervical subarachnoid space in adult wild-type mice induces permanent motor disability which is associated with hallmark pathological features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis including motor neuron loss, cytoplasmic TDP-43 translocation, reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. Motor impairments are not induced by SOD1, C9orf72 or TARDBP CSF, although a moderate degree of histopathological change occurs in C9orf72 and TARDBP CSF-injected mice. By conducting a series of CSF filtration studies and global proteomic analysis of CSF, we identified apolipoprotein B-100 in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis CSF as the putative agent responsible for inducing motor disability, motor neuron degeneration and pathological translocation of TDP-43. Apolipoprotein B-100 alone is sufficient to recapitulate clinical and pathological outcomes in vivo and induce death of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons in vitro. Targeted removal of apolipoprotein B-100 from sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis CSF via filtration or immunodepletion successfully attenuated the neurotoxic capacity of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis CSF to induce motor disability, motor neuron death, and TDP-43 translocation. This study presents apolipoprotein B-100 as a novel therapeutic target specific for the predominant sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and establishes proof-of-concept to support CSF pheresis as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating neurotoxicity in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</abstract>"]}

Mattos (Bignoniaceae) tree has long been used in traditional South American healing practises to treat inflammation. However, its anti-inflammatory activity has not been closely examined. Here we use chemical extraction, qualitative phytochemical examination, toxicity testing and quantitative examination of anti-inflammatory activity on human cells ex vivo. All extracts were found to be nontoxic. We found different extracts exhibited unique cytokine profiles with some extracts outperforming a positive control used in the clinic. These results verify the immunomodulatory activity of Handroanthus impetiginosus (Mart. ex DC.) Mattos (Bignoniaceae) tree bark-derived compounds. Collectively, combining a lack of toxicity and potency in human immune cells supports further fractionation and research.<sep>Stonefish are regarded as one of the most venomous fish in the world. Research on stonefish venom has chiefly focused on the in vitro and in vivo neurological, cardiovascular, cytotoxic and nociceptive effects of the venom. The last literature review on stonefish venom was published over a decade ago, and much has changed in the field since. In this review, we have generated a global map of the current distribution of all stonefish (Synanceia) species, presented a table of clinical case reports and provided up-to-date information about the development of polyspecific stonefish antivenom. We have also presented an overview of recent advancements in the biomolecular composition of stonefish venom, including the analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data from Synanceia horrida venom gland. Moreover, this review highlights the need for further research on the composition and properties of stonefish venom, which may reveal novel molecules for drug discovery, development or other novel physiological uses.<sep>The large box jellyfish Chironex fleckeri is found in northern Australian waters. A sting from this cubozoan species can kill within minutes. From clinical and animal studies, symptoms comprise severe pain, welts, scarring, hypotension, vasospasms, cardiac irregularities and cardiac arrest. At present, there is no cure and opioids are used to manage pain. Antivenom is available but controversy exists over its effectiveness. Experimental and combination therapies performed in vitro and in vivo have shown varied efficacy. These inconsistent results are likely a consequence of the different methods used to extract venom. Recent omics analysis has shed light on the systems of C. fleckeri venom action, including new toxin classes that use pore formation, cell membrane collapse and ion channel modulation. This review covers what is known on C. fleckeri pathomechanisms and highlights current gaps in knowledge. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms of C. fleckeri venom-induced pathology may lead to novel treatments and possibly, the discovery of novel cell pathways, novel drug scaffolds and novel drug targets for human disease.<sep>Abstract T-cells are critical components of the adaptive immune system. Upon activation, they acquire effector functions through a complex interplay between mRNA transcripts and proteins, the landscape of which remains to be fully elucidated. In this resource article, we present an integrative temporal proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of primary human CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells following ex vivo activation with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads. Our data reveal a time-dependent dissociation between the T-cell transcriptome and proteome during activation. A transient downregulation of GLUT1, the central glucose transporter in T-cells, marked the onset of reprogramming in both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells. At late activation, CD4 + T-cells upregulated enzymes associated with degradation of fatty acids while CD8 + T-cells preferentially upregulated enzymes in the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. Surprisingly, we found that activated CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells became transcriptionally more divergent at the same time their proteome became more similar. In addition to the metabolic reprogramming highlighted in our analysis, this dataset provides a public resource for understanding temporal molecular changes governing the acquisition of effector functions by T-cells.<sep>Venoms act with remarkable specificity upon a broad diversity of physiological targets. Venoms are composed of proteins, peptides, and small molecules, providing the foundation for the development of novel therapeutics. This study assessed the effect of venom from the red-bellied black snake (Pseudechis porphyriacus) on human primary leukocytes using bead-based flow cytometry, mixed lymphocyte reaction, and cell viability assays. We show that venom treatment had a significant immunosuppressive effect, inhibiting the secretion of interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from purified human T cells by 90% or greater following stimulation with mitogen (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin) or via cluster of differentiation (CD) receptors, CD3/CD28. In contrast, venom treatment did not inhibit TNF or IL-6 release from antigen-presenting cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. The reduced cytokine release from T cells was not associated with inhibition of T cell proliferation or reduction of cell viability, consistent with an anti-inflammatory mechanism unrelated to the cell cycle. Deconvolution of the venom using reverse-phase HPLC identified four fractions responsible for the observed immunosuppressive activity. These data suggest that compounds from P. porphyriacus venom may be potential drug leads for T cell-associated conditions such as graft versus host disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.<sep>The dynamic host-parasite mechanisms underlying hookworm infection establishment and maintenance in mammalian hosts remain poorly understood but are primarily mediated by hookworm’s excretory/secretory products (ESPs), which have a wide spectrum of biological functions. We used ultra-high performance mass spectrometry to comprehensively profile and compare female and male ESPs from the zoonotic human hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum, which is a natural parasite of dogs, cats, and humans. We improved the genome annotation, decreasing the number of protein-coding genes by 49% while improving completeness from 92 to 96%. Compared to the previous genome annotation, we detected 11% and 10% more spectra in female and male ESPs, respectively, using this improved version, identifying a total of 795 ESPs (70% in both sexes, with the remaining sex-specific). Using functional databases (KEGG, GO and Interpro), common and sex-specific enriched functions were identified. Comparisons with the exclusively human-infective hookworm Necator americanus identified species-specific and conserved ESPs. This is the first study identifying ESPs from female and male A. ceylanicum. The findings provide a deeper understanding of hookworm protein functions that assure long-term host survival and facilitate future engineering of transgenic hookworms and analysis of regulatory elements mediating the high-level expression of ESPs. Furthermore, the findings expand the list of potential vaccine and diagnostic targets and identify biologics that can be explored for anti-inflammatory potential.<sep>Introduction Opisthorchis felineus , Opisthorchis viverrini , and Clonorchis sinensis are the most medically important species of fish-borne zoonotic trematodes. O. felineus is endemic to the river plains of Western Siberia and Eastern Europe, and it is estimated that more than 1.6 million people could be infected with this parasite. Chronic opisthorchiasis may lead to significant gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary pathology. This study aimed to identify and characterize proteins from the secreted and tegumental proteomes of O. felineus . Methods Adult flukes were collected from experimentally infected hamsters and cultured in vitro in serum-free media. We extracted proteins from different compartments of the O. felineus secretome, including (i) soluble excretory/secretory (ES) products; (ii) secreted 15K-extracellular vesicles (EVs); and (iii) tegument. Results We also generated a transcriptome using long-read sequencing, and when this was combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry, sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation, and protein digestion, we identified 686, 894, 389, 324, and 165 proteins from the ES, 15K-EV, and the three sequentially extracted tegument (TEG) protein fractions, respectively. We conducted in-depth gene ontology and protein family analyses on the identified proteins and discussed comparisons against similar proteome data sets acquired for the Southeast Asian liver fluke O. viverrini and the Chinese liver fluke C. sinensis . Discussion The information from this study will form a biologically relevant data set of O. felineus proteins that could be used to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools to manage the human cost of O. felineus infection and its associated comorbidities.<sep>More than 90% of the adult population globally is chronically infected by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is well established that EBV is associated with a number of malignancies, and advances in knowledge of EBV-related malignancies are being made every year. Several studies have analysed the global epidemiology and geographic distribution of EBV-related cancers. However, most have only described a single cancer type or subtype in isolation or limited their study to the three or four most common EBV-related cancers. This review will present an overview on the spectrum of cancers linked to EBV based on observations of associations and proportions in the published literature while also using these observations to estimate the incidence and mortality burden of some of these cancers.We have reviewed the literature on defining features, distribution and outcomes across six cancers with a relatively large EBV-related case burden: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Gastric carcinoma (GC), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, Nasal type (ENKTL-NT). We retrieved published region-specific EBV-related case proportions for NPC, GC, HL and BL and performed meta-analyses on pooled region-specific studies of EBV-related case proportions for DLBCL and ENKTL-NT. We match these pooled proportions with their respective regional incidence and mortality numbers retrieved from a publicly available cancer database. Additionally, we also reviewed the literature on several other less common EBV-related cancers to summarize their key characteristics herein.We estimated that EBV-related cases from these six cancers accounted for 239,700-357,900 new cases and 137,900-208,700 deaths in 2020. This review highlights the significant global impact of EBV-related cancers and extends the spectrum of disease that could benefit from an EBV-specific therapeutic.<sep>Nitrogen (N) fertilizers are routinely applied to bananas ( Musa spp.) to increase production but may exacerbate plant diseases like Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB), which is the most economically important disease. Here, we characterized the effects of N rate and form on banana plant growth, root proteome, bacterial and fungal diversity in the rhizosphere, the concentration of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc) in the soil, and the FWB severity. Banana plants ( Musa subgroup ABB) were grown under greenhouse conditions in soil with ammonium or nitrate supplemented at five N rates, and with or without inoculation with Foc. The growth of non-inoculated plants was positively correlated with the N rate. In bananas inoculated with Foc, disease severity increased with the N rate, resulting in the Foc-inoculated plant growth being greatest at intermediate N rates. The abundance of Foc in the soil was weakly related to the treatment conditions and was a poor predictor of disease severity. Fungal diversity was consistently affected by Foc inoculation, while bacterial diversity was associated with changes in soil pH resulting from N addition, in particular ammonium. N rate altered the expression of host metabolic pathways associated with carbon fixation, energy usage, amino acid metabolism, and importantly stress response signaling, irrespective of inoculation or N form. Furthermore, in diseased plants, Pathogenesis-related protein 1, a key endpoint for biotic stress response and the salicylic acid defense response to biotrophic pathogens, was negatively correlated with the rate of ammonium fertilizer but not nitrate. As expected, inoculation with Foc altered the expression of a wide range of processes in the banana plant including those of defense and growth. In summary, our results indicate that the severity of FWB was negatively associated with host defenses, which was influenced by N application (particularly ammonium), and shifts in microbial communities associated with ammonium-induced acidification.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Internalization<sep>genomic DNA<sep>Biodistribution<sep>B-cell receptor<sep>GABAergic<sep>Fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy<sep>Nanomaterials<sep>Minor groove<sep>Langerhans cell<sep>Excitatory postsynaptic potential<sep>DNA nanotechnology<sep>Glycobiology<sep>In vitro<sep>Kidney<sep>DC-SIGN<sep>C-type lectin<sep>DNA sequencing<sep>Neurotransmission<sep>Synthetic biology<sep>DNA origami<sep>PEGylation<sep>Glutamate receptor<sep>Antibody<sep>Synapse<sep>Immune system<sep>Antigen<sep>Immunogen<sep>Concanavalin A<sep>Avidity<sep>Folding (DSP implementation)<sep>Inhibitory postsynaptic potential<sep>Biomolecule<sep>Nucleic acid<sep>Glutamatergic<sep>Genome<sep>Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)<sep>Lectin<sep>Confocal microscopy<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Glycan<sep>Dendritic cell<sep>Nuclease<sep>DNA<sep>Confocal<sep>Toxicity<sep>B cell<sep>Surface modification<sep>Langerin<sep>Nanostructure<sep>Whole genome sequencing<sep>Synaptic vesicle<sep>Nanocarriers<sep>Covalent bond<sep>Excitatory synapse<sep>Synaptic plasticity<sep>Endonuclease<sep>Allosteric regulation<sep>Fluorescence<sep>Gene</keyword><title>Functionalizing DNA origami to investigate and interact with biological systems<sep><i>In Situ</i> Covalent Functionalization of DNA Origami Virus-like Particles<sep>Rational Design of a DNA‐Scaffolded High‐Affinity Binder for Langerin<sep>Asymmetrically Branched Precision Glycooligomers Targeting Langerin<sep>Role of nanoscale antigen organization on B-cell activation probed using DNA origami<sep>Multiplexed and high-throughput neuronal fluorescence imaging with diffusible probes<sep>Enhancing antibody responses by multivalent antigen display on thymus-independent DNA origami scaffolds<sep>A Remote Secondary Binding Pocket Promotes Heteromultivalent Targeting of DC-SIGN<sep>Evaluation of non-modified wireframe DNA origami for acute toxicity and biodistribution in mice<sep>Evaluation of Nonmodified Wireframe DNA Origami for Acute Toxicity and Biodistribution in Mice<sep>Controlling wireframe DNA origami nuclease degradation with minor groove binders<sep>A Specific, Glycomimetic Langerin Ligand for Human Langerhans Cell Targeting<sep>Programming Structured DNA Assemblies to Probe Biophysical Processes<sep>Bioproduction of pure, kilobase-scale single-stranded DNA<sep>Perturbations of a causal synaptic molecular network in autism and schizophrenia revealed with multiplexed imaging<sep>Molecular Diversity of Glutamatergic and GABAergic Synapses from Multiplexed Fluorescence Imaging<sep>Controlling Nuclease Degradation of Wireframe DNA Origami with Minor Groove Binders<sep>Bioproduction of single-stranded DNA from isogenic miniphage</title><abstract>DNA origami has emerged as a powerful method to generate DNA nanostructures with dynamic properties and nanoscale control. These nanostructures enable complex biophysical studies and the fabrication of next-generation therapeutic devices. For these applications, DNA origami typically needs to be functionalized with bioactive ligands and biomacromolecular cargos. Here, we review methods developed to functionalize, purify and characterize DNA origami nanostructures. We identify remaining challenges such as limitations in functionalization efficiency and characterization. We then discuss where researchers can contribute to further advance the fabrication of functionalized DNA origami. DNA origami nanostructures are useful constructs for biophysical and therapeutic studies. This Review discusses how these nanostructures are functionalized with bioactive conjugates, purified and characterized, and compares the advantages and limitations of these methods in the context of different applications.<sep>DNA origami is a powerful nanomaterial for biomedical applications due in part to its capacity for programmable, site-specific functionalization. To realize these applications, scalable and efficient conjugation protocols are needed for diverse moieties ranging from small molecules to biomacromolecules. Currently, there are no facile and general methods for in situ covalent modification and label-free quantification of reaction conversion. Here, we investigate the postassembly functionalization of DNA origami and the subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography-based characterization of these nanomaterials. Following this approach, we developed a versatile DNA origami functionalization and characterization platform. We observed quantitative in situ conversion using widely accessible click chemistry for carbohydrates, small molecules, peptides, polymers, and proteins. This platform should provide broader access to covalently functionalized DNA origami, as illustrated here by PEGylation for passivation and HIV antigen decoration to construct virus-like particle vaccines.<sep>Abstract Binders of langerin could target vaccines to Langerhans cells for improved therapeutic effect. Since langerin has low affinity for monovalent glycan ligands, highly multivalent presentation has previously been key for targeting. Aiming to reduce the amount of ligand required, we rationally designed molecularly defined high‐affinity binders based on the precise display of glycomimetic ligands (Glc2NTs) on DNA‐PNA scaffolds. Rather than mimicking langerin's homotrimeric structure with a C3‐symmetric scaffold, we developed readily accessible, easy‐to‐design bivalent binders. The method considers the requirements for bridging sugar binding sites and statistical rebinding as a means to both strengthen the interactions at single binding sites and amplify the avidity enhancement provided by chelation. This gave a 1150‐fold net improvement over the affinity of the free ligand and provided a nanomolar binder (IC 50 =300 nM) for specific internalization by langerin‐expressing cells.<sep>Asymmetrically branched precision glycooligomers are synthesized by solid-phase polymer synthesis for studying multivalent carbohydrate-protein interactions. Through the stepwise assembly of Fmoc-protected oligo(amidoamine) building blocks and Fmoc/Dde-protected lysine, straightforward variation of structural parameters such as the number and length of arms, as well as the number and position of carbohydrate ligands, is achieved. Binding of 1-arm and 3-arm glycooligomers toward lectin receptors langerin and concanavalin A (ConA) was evaluated where the smallest 3-arm glycooligomer shows the highest binding toward langerin, and stepwise elongation of one, two, or all three arms leads to decreased binding. When directly comparing binding toward langerin and ConA, we find that structural variation of the scaffold affects glycomimetic ligand binding differently for the different targets, indicating the potential to tune such ligands not only for their avidity but also for their selectivity toward different lectins.<sep>Vaccine efficacy can be increased by arraying immunogens in multivalent form on virus-like nanoparticles to enhance B-cell activation. However, the effects of antigen copy number, spacing and affinity, as well as the dimensionality and rigidity of scaffold presentation on B-cell activation remain poorly understood. Here, we display the clinical vaccine immunogen eOD-GT8, an engineered outer domain of the HIV-1 glycoprotein-120, on DNA origami nanoparticles to systematically interrogate the impact of these nanoscale parameters on B-cell activation in vitro. We find that B-cell signalling is maximized by as few as five antigens maximally spaced on the surface of a 40-nm viral-like nanoparticle. Increasing antigen spacing up to ~25-30 nm monotonically increases B-cell receptor activation. Moreover, scaffold rigidity is essential for robust B-cell triggering. These results reveal molecular vaccine design principles that may be used to drive functional B-cell responses.<sep>Abstract Synapses contain hundreds of distinct proteins whose heterogeneous expression levels are determinants of synaptic plasticity and signal transmission relevant to a range of diseases. Here, we use diffusible nucleic acid imaging probes to profile neuronal synapses using multiplexed confocal and super-resolution microscopy. Confocal imaging is performed using high-affinity locked nucleic acid imaging probes that stably yet reversibly bind to oligonucleotides conjugated to antibodies and peptides. Super-resolution PAINT imaging of the same targets is performed using low-affinity DNA imaging probes to resolve nanometer-scale synaptic protein organization across nine distinct protein targets. Our approach enables the quantitative analysis of thousands of synapses in neuronal culture to identify putative synaptic sub-types and co-localization patterns from one dozen proteins. Application to characterize synaptic reorganization following neuronal activity blockade reveals coordinated upregulation of the post-synaptic proteins PSD-95, SHANK3 and Homer-1b/c, as well as increased correlation between synaptic markers in the active and synaptic vesicle zones.<sep>Abstract Protein-based virus-like particles (P-VLPs) are commonly used to spatially organize antigens and enhance humoral immunity through multivalent antigen display. However, P-VLPs are thymus-dependent antigens that are themselves immunogenic and can induce B cell responses that may neutralize the platform. Here, we investigate thymus-independent DNA origami as an alternative material for multivalent antigen display using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the primary target of neutralizing antibody responses. Sequential immunization of mice with DNA-based VLPs (DNA-VLPs) elicits protective neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a manner that depends on the valency of the antigen displayed and on T cell help. Importantly, the immune sera do not contain boosted, class-switched antibodies against the DNA scaffold, in contrast to P-VLPs that elicit strong B cell memory against both the target antigen and the scaffold. Thus, DNA-VLPs enhance target antigen immunogenicity without generating scaffold-directed immunity and thereby offer an important alternative material for particulate vaccine design.<sep>Dendritic cells (DC) are antigen-presenting cells coordinating the interplay of the innate and the adaptive immune response. The endocytic C-type lectin receptors DC-SIGN and Langerin display expression profiles restricted to distinct DC subtypes and have emerged as prime targets for next-generation immunotherapies and anti-infectives. Using heteromultivalent liposomes copresenting mannosides bearing aromatic aglycones with natural glycan ligands, we serendipitously discovered striking cooperativity effects for DC-SIGN+ but not for Langerin+ cell lines. Mechanistic investigations combining NMR spectroscopy with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations led to the identification of a secondary binding pocket for the glycomimetics. This pocket, located remotely of DC-SIGN's carbohydrate bindings site, can be leveraged by heteromultivalent avidity enhancement. We further present preliminary evidence that the aglycone allosterically activates glycan recognition and thereby contributes to DC-SIGN-specific cell targeting. Our findings have important implications for both translational and basic glycoscience, showcasing heteromultivalent targeting of DCs to improve specificity and supporting potential allosteric regulation of DC-SIGN and CLRs in general.<sep>Abstract Wireframe DNA origami can be used to fabricate virus-like particles for a range of biomedical applications, including the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics. However, the acute toxicity and biodistribution of these wireframe nucleic acid nanoparticles (NANPs) have not previously been characterized in animal models. In the present study, we observed no indications of toxicity in BALB/c mice following therapeutically relevant dosage of unmodified DNA-based NANPs via intravenous administration, based on liver and kidney histology, liver biochemistry, and body weight. Further, the immunotoxicity of these NANPs was minimal, as indicated by blood cell counts and type-I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In an SJL/J model of autoimmunity, we observed no indications of NANP-mediated DNA-specific antibody response or immune-mediated kidney pathology following the intraperitoneal administration of NANPs. Finally, biodistribution studies revealed that these NANPs accumulate in the liver within one hour, concomitant with substantial renal clearance. Our observations support the continued development of wireframe DNA-based NANPs as next-generation nucleic acid therapeutic delivery platforms.<sep>Wireframe DNA origami can be used to fabricate virus-like particles for a range of biomedical applications, including the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics.

However, as biodegradable materials, their utility for specific therapeutic indications depends on their structural integrity during biodistribution to efficiently target cells, tissues, or organs. Here, we explore reversible minor groove binders to control the degradation half-lives of wireframe DNA origami. Bare, two-helix DNA nanoparticles were found to be stable under typical cell culture conditions in presence of bovine serum, yet they remain susceptible to endonucleases, specifically DNAse I. Moreover, they degrade rapidly in mouse serum, suggesting species-specific degradation. Blocking minor groove accessibility with diamidines resulted in substantial protection against endonucleases, specifically DNAse-I. This strategy was found to be compatible with both varying wireframe DNA origami architectures and functionalization with protein antigens. Our stabilization strategy offers distinct physicochemical properties compared with established cationic polymer-based methods, with synergistic therapeutic potential for minor groove binder delivery for infectious diseases and cancer.<sep>Langerhans cells are a subset of dendritic cells residing in the epidermis of the human skin. As such, they are key mediators of immune regulation and have emerged as prime targets for novel transcutaneous cancer vaccines. Importantly, the induction of protective T cell immunity by these vaccines requires the efficient and specific delivery of both tumor-associated antigens and adjuvants. Langerhans cells uniquely express Langerin (CD207), an endocytic C-type lectin receptor. Here, we report the discovery of a specific, glycomimetic Langerin ligand employing a heparin-inspired design strategy and structural characterization by NMR spectroscopy and molecular docking. The conjugation of this glycomimetic to liposomes enabled the specific and efficient targeting of Langerhans cells in the human skin. We further demonstrate the doxorubicin-mediated killing of a Langerin+ monocyte cell line, highlighting its therapeutic and diagnostic potential in Langerhans cell histiocytosis, caused by the abnormal proliferation of Langerin+ myeloid progenitor cells. Overall, our delivery platform provides superior versatility over antibody-based approaches and novel modalities to overcome current limitations of dendritic cell-targeted immuno- and chemotherapy.<sep>Structural DNA nanotechnology is beginning to emerge as a widely accessible research tool to mechanistically study diverse biophysical processes. Enabled by scaffolded DNA origami in which a long single strand of DNA is weaved throughout an entire target nucleic acid assembly to ensure its proper folding, assemblies of nearly any geometric shape can now be programmed in a fully automatic manner to interface with biology on the 1-100-nm scale. Here, we review the major design and synthesis principles that have enabled the fabrication of a specific subclass of scaffolded DNA origami objects called wireframe assemblies. These objects offer unprecedented control over the nanoscale organization of biomolecules, including biomolecular copy numbers, presentation on convex or concave geometries, and internal versus external functionalization, in addition to stability in physiological buffer. To highlight the power and versatility of this synthetic structural biology approach to probing molecular and cellular biophysics, we feature its application to three leading areas of investigation: light harvesting and nanoscale energy transport, RNA structural biology, and immune receptor signaling, with an outlook toward unique mechanistic insight that may be gained in these areas in the coming decade.<sep>Abstract Scalable production of kilobase single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with sequence control has applications in therapeutics, gene synthesis and sequencing, scaffolded DNA origami, and archival DNA memory storage. Biological production of circular ssDNA (cssDNA) using M13 addresses these needs at low cost. However, one unmet goal is to minimize the essential protein coding regions of the exported DNA while maintaining its infectivity and production purity to produce sequences less than 3,000 nt in length, relevant to therapeutic and materials science applications. Toward this end, synthetic miniphage with inserts of custom sequence and size offers scalable, low-cost synthesis of cssDNA at milligram and higher scales. Here, we optimize growth conditions using an E . coli helper strain combined with a miniphage genome carrying only an f1 origin and a β-lactamase-encoding ( bla ) antibiotic resistance gene, enabling isolation of pure cssDNA with a minimum sequence genomic length of 1,676 nt, without requiring additional purification from contaminating DNA. Low-cost scalability of isogenic, custom-length cssDNA is demonstrated for a sequence of 2,520 nt using a bioreactor, purified with low endotoxin levels (&lt;5 E.U./ml). We apply these exonuclease-resistant cssDNAs to the self-assembly of wireframe DNA origami objects and to encode digital information on the miniphage genome for biological amplification.<sep>The complex functions of neuronal synapses in the central nervous system depend on their tightly interacting, compartmentalized molecular network of hundreds of proteins spanning the pre- and post-synaptic sites. This biochemical system is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, with identified common synaptopathologies and numerous risk genes associated with synaptic function. However, it remains unclear how the synaptic molecular network is altered in these disorders, and whether effects are common to distinct genetic perturbations. Here, we applied PRISM, a quantitative single-synapse multiplexed imaging technique, to systematically probe the effects of RNAi knockdown of 16 autism- and schizophrenia-associated genes on the simultaneous distribution of 10 synaptic proteins. This enabled the identification of novel phenotypes in synapse compositions and distributions. We applied Bayesian network inference to construct and validate a predictive model of causal hierarchical dependencies among eight proteins of the excitatory synapse. The resulting conditional dependence relationships could only be accessed via measurement which is both single-synapse and multiprotein, unique to PRISM. Finally, we show that central features of the network are similarly affected across distinct gene knockdowns. These results offer insight into the convergent molecular etiology of these debilitating, hereditary and highly polygenic disorders, as well as offering a novel, general framework for probing subcellular molecular networks.<sep>Acute flaccid myelitis, defined by acute flaccid limb weakness in the setting of grey matter lesions of the spinal cord, became increasingly recognised in 2014 following outbreaks in Colorado and California, temporally associated with an outbreak of enterovirus D68 respiratory disease. Since then, there have been biennial increases in late summer/early fall. A viral infectious aetiology, most likely enteroviral, is strongly suspected, but a definitive connection has yet to be established. Patients typically present with asymmetric weakness, maximal proximally, in the setting of a febrile illness. MRI demonstrates T2/FLAIR abnormalities in the central grey matter of the spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with variable elevation in protein. The weakness may be progressive over several days and involve respiratory muscles, making early recognition and close monitoring essential. Other complications in the acute period may include autonomic instability and bowel/bladder involvement. There is no clear recommended treatment at this time, although intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and plasma exchange have been used. Intensive therapies and rehab services have shown benefit in maximising function, and surgical interventions may be considered in cases without optimal response to therapies. Close attention should also be paid to psychosocial factors. Prognosis is generally guarded, and additional factors that predict final outcome, including host factors and treatment effects, have yet to be elucidated. Multicentre collaborative efforts will be required to provide answers about this rare but serious disorder.<sep>Viruslike particles (VLPs) fabricated using wireframe DNA origami are emerging as promising vaccine and gene therapeutic delivery platforms due to their programmable nature that offers independent control over their size and shape, as well as their site-specific functionalization. As materials that biodegrade in the presence of endonucleases, specifically DNase I and II, their utility for the targeting of cells, tissues, and organs depends on their stability in vivo. Here, we explore minor groove binders (MGBs) as specific endonuclease inhibitors to control the degradation half-life of wireframe DNA origami. Bare, unprotected DNA-VLPs composed of two-helix edges were found to be stable in fetal bovine serum under typical cell culture conditions and in human serum for 24 h but degraded within 3 h in mouse serum, suggesting species-specific endonuclease activity. Inhibiting endonucleases by incubating DNA-VLPs with diamidine-class MGBs increased their half-lives in mouse serum by more than 12 h, corroborated by protection against isolated DNase I and II. Our stabilization strategy was compatible with the functionalization of DNA-VLPs with HIV antigens, did not interfere with B-cell signaling activity of DNA-VLPs in vitro, and was nontoxic to B-cell lines. It was further found to be compatible with multiple wireframe DNA origami geometries and edge architectures. MGB protection is complementary to existing methods such as PEGylation and chemical cross-linking, offering a facile protocol to control DNase-mediated degradation rates for in vitro and possibly in vivo therapeutic and vaccine applications.<sep>Abstract Scalable production of gene-length single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with sequence control has applications in homology directed repair templating, gene synthesis and sequencing, scaffolded DNA origami, and archival DNA memory storage. Biological production of circular single-stranded DNA (cssDNA) using bacteriophage M13 addresses these needs at low cost. A primary goal toward this end is to minimize the essential protein coding regions of the produced, exported sequence while maintaining its infectivity and production purity, with engineered regions of sequence control. Synthetic miniphage constitutes an ideal platform for bacterial production of isogenic cssDNA, using inserts of custom sequence and size to attain this goal, offering an inexpensive resource at milligram and higher synthesis scales. Here, we show that the Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) helper strain M13cp combined with a miniphage genome carrying only an f1 origin and a β-lactamase-encoding ( bla ) antibiotic resistance gene enables the production of pure cssDNA with a minimum sequence genomic length of 1,676 nt directly from bacteria, without the need for additional purification from contaminating dsDNA, genomic DNA, or fragmented DNAs. Low-cost scalability of isogenic, custom-length cssDNA is also demonstrated for a sequence of 2,520 nt using a commercial bioreactor. We apply this system to generate cssDNA for the programmed self-assembly of wireframe DNA origami objects with exonuclease-resistant, custom-designed circular scaffolds that are purified with low endotoxin levels (&lt;5 E.U./ml) for therapeutic applications. We also encode digital information that is stored on the genome with application to write-once, read-many archival data storage.</abstract>", "<keyword>Local authority<sep>Health and Retirement Study<sep>Odds<sep>Judgement<sep>Transparency (behavior)<sep>Group analysis<sep>Loan<sep>Cost effectiveness<sep>Perspective (graphical)<sep>Psychological resilience<sep>Retirement age<sep>Life course approach<sep>Group (periodic table)<sep>Earnings<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Residence<sep>Grey literature<sep>Premise<sep>Pension<sep>Feeling<sep>Inclusion (mineral)<sep>Agency (philosophy)<sep>Variation (astronomy)<sep>Consistency (knowledge bases)<sep>Retirement planning<sep>Structural equation modeling<sep>Autonomy<sep>Young adult<sep>Social care</keyword><title>Exploring Local Authority Variation in Looked After Young People’s Subjective Well-being<sep>A critical review of cost‐effectiveness research in children's social care: What have we learnt so far?<sep>Young British adults’ homeownership circumstances and the role of intergenerational transfers<sep>Can't save or won't save: financial resilience and discretionary retirement saving among British adults in their thirties and forties<sep>The social, cultural and economic influences on retirement saving for young adults in the UK<sep>Gender Difference in British Young Adults’ Retirement Saving Decision-Making Process: A Multi-Group Analysis Using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)<sep>Younger adults’ retirement saving and wealth accumulation in Britain a quantitative investigation</title><abstract>Abstract There has been growing interest in the Local Authority (LA) variation in rates of admission to care and provision of services but less is known about whether young people’s experience of care varies by LA. Using survey data from 4,994 looked after young people (aged eleven to eighteen years) from thirty-six English LAs, the analyses focused on LA variation in their subjective well-being. There was a statistically small LA variation in young people’s responses to individual survey questions except for a question that asked if young people felt they had a trusted adult in their lives. Between 66 per cent and 100 per cent of young people had a trusted adult depending on the LA caring for them. Positively associated with overall well-being were, being looked after by a non-London LA, a longer length of time in care, fewer placement moves, children’s positive perceptions of a reciprocal trusting relationship with their carer, having a good friend and being male. Counter-intuitively, LAs with an outstanding or good Ofsted social care or education judgement were associated with a higher proportion of their young people having low well-being.<sep>Abstract This article presents the findings from a critical review of cost‐effectiveness research in children's social care. With a focus on the past 20 years (since 2000), the review aims to assess the use and consistency of definitions relevant to evaluating cost‐effectiveness such as financial input (costs) and outcomes, and to review and summarise learnings from cost‐effectiveness studies in the English children's social care system. We included both academic and grey literature and identified 61 relevant publications for inclusion. The results are organised according to three themes: costs, outcomes and cost‐effectiveness. We identified that a large proportion of studies contained a discussion on cost, spend or unit cost, and an equal proportion of articles concerned outcomes of service, benefit to children or quality of service provided. The number of studies discussing cost‐effectiveness, cost–benefit or economic evaluation was considerably smaller. The findings highlight substantial gaps in the literature, with a disproportionate focus on stating the problem in terms of cost pressures, and very little robust evidence about cost‐effectiveness. Furthermore, the article sets out methodological limitations and indicates a lack of transparency in many of the report studies. We conclude that as a result of the gaps and limitations it is difficult for policymakers and other stakeholders in children's services to make evidence‐informed decisions about the best use of their limited resources.<sep>Despite the continuing preference for homeownership, it has become increasingly difficult for young adults to own a home in Britain. House prices have increased faster than real earnings between the mid-1990s and the 2010s, resulting in significantly deteriorated affordability. Mortgage products have also become less accessible, as a large deposit has been required to secure the loan after the financial crisis of 2008/09. Previous studies point to the increasing role of intergenerational transfers in filling this gap. Some young adults obtain help from family to become homeowners, either receiving monetary support or by saving through living at the parental home. Using the Wealth and Assets Survey, this study attempts to examine the effect of these two types of family financial support on young adults’ homeownership circumstances, and controlling for other characteristics such as parental homeownership. First, it examines the characteristics of homeowners among young adults cross-sectionally using logistic regression. Second, by focusing on the non-homeowner subsample it analyses the effect of direct (money) and indirect (co-residence) family support on young adults’ entry to homeownership in the six-year period using discrete-time event history analysis. The results show that chances of young adults’ homeownership between 2008/10 and 2014/16 are very much tied to family support. The odds of becoming homeowners who have received direct or indirect support are found to be three times higher, even after accounting for other characteristics.<sep>Abstract This study examines retirement saving activity outside the state and workplace pension saving schemes among British adults aged between 30 and 49 on the premise that individuals are increasingly encouraged to save for their retirement in the new pension policy structure in Britain. The issue of under-saving among the younger adults has been studied with the focus on internal characteristics, such as undesirable attitudinal or behavioural tendencies (‘won't save’), or on external factors, such as income (‘can't save’). Building on these discussions, this study tests the role of internal characteristics and further examines the interplay between internal and external factors. The decision-making process for retirement saving is mapped based on the Model of Financial Planning with minor modifications. The analysis utilises the fourth wave of the Wealth and Assets Survey (2012/2014), and is conducted in the structural equation modelling framework. Results show that younger adults’ discretionary retirement saving is an outcome of a complex interplay between internal and external factors. Financial resilience , which indicates current financial behaviours and wellbeing, is found to be the strongest predictor for identifying a discretionary retirement saver, but it is closely connected to individuals’ income and home-ownership. The findings also suggest that social and economic arrangements are important to consider as social ageing , individuals’ projection on their lifestages, may be more informative than age per se for understanding younger adults’ retirement saving behaviour. These findings have important implications for the policies that aim to increase retirement saving participation.<sep>How young adults in the UK save for their retirement has become more complex due to recent changes to the pension policy, which necessitate greater and continuous private saving (through workplace pension schemes and other savings vehicles). As the importance of active saving during working life grows, it becomes essential to understand young adults’ retirement saving behaviour. In this chapter, we focus on the younger half of the working age population in the UK (adults aged up to 50, hereafter young adults) to fully capture the experiences of becoming an adult in the first part of t working life and how this shapes financial behaviours, acknowledging that patterns of ageing vary across different groups (Baars et al., 2013; Mortimer & Moen, 2016). Our work suggests that young British adults’ approach to retirement saving is not simply a function of income (or the lack of it), or present bias/myopia, but instead concerns how social and economic circumstances coalesce. By combining the findings from two studies on the young adults’ retirement saving, using quantitative and qualitative data, we provide a nuanced picture of how young adults’ social, cultural and economic factors inform retirement saving. Drawing on a social ageing perspective, meaning the ways in which individuals perceive their life-course progression, we demonstrate that young people’s retirement saving is contingent on feeling financially resilient and established in their adult lives, guided by economic, social and cultural norms. We argue that this social ageing perspective is essential to understanding retirement saving activity amongst young adults, and highlight theoretical, methodological and policy implications.<sep>Several changes have been made to the state and workplace pension schemes in recent decades in Britain. One of the implications of these changes is that individuals now carry greater risks in accumulating and generating retirement income. Many studies have discussed the role of attitudinal and behavioral tendencies in the retirement saving decision-making process. However, the way these tendencies manifest themselves is assumed to be identical for men and women, as most studies examined the partial gender effect. These differences are particularly meaningful for those in early stages of adulthood, as their experience of key life events is shaped by socially constructed gender norms. While an increasing gender disparity in pension wealth over the life course is widely recognized in Britain, not many studies have provided empirical evidence on potential gender differences in young adults’ additional retirement saving. This study examines whether men and women differ in their retirement saving decision-making process, and if so to what extent. To do so, it uses an adapted version of Hershey and colleagues’ model of financial planning with the fourth wave of the Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS). Findings show that financial resilience, which represents individuals’ everyday financial behavior, is the most influential predictor for identifying retirement savers for both males and females. However, the manner in which their current socio-economic environment – income, homeownership, marital status, offspring – is interlinked with financial resilience varies considerably by gender. The partial effect of education on myopia also differs by gender. These findings suggest that there are indeed gender differences in the retirement saving decision-making process and that failing to consider such difference in policies may widen the gender gap in retirement saving.<sep>Recent developments in the pension landscape have resulted in an increased level of uncertainty for the younger generation’s retirement saving, the nature of which has consequently become more akin to wealth accumulation. Young adults are increasingly encouraged to save more for the future; however, not much is known about their approaches to retirement saving and wealth accumulation. This thesis aims to assess these approaches; it first focuses on the younger generation’s current economic autonomy in retirement saving and further expands it to investigate young adults’ wealth accumulation patterns. The thesis consists of four studies. The first study examines the role of human agency in retirement saving using structural equation modelling, and argues that individuals’ economic autonomy is closely linked to their socio-economic arrangements. The second study further investigates gender differences in retirement saving decision-making process using SEM multi-group analysis, and documents the negative impact of the male-breadwinner income model on women’s financial resilience. The third study examines the role of financial support from family in young adults’ homeownership in discrete-time event history analysis. The results point to a substantial amount of both direct help (money) and indirect assistance (co-residence). The last study assesses wealth accumulation patterns by establishing four saver types using factor mixture modelling. Transition between the saver types over time is analysed using latent transition analysis. The results show that, while the transitions between saver types over time are mostly stable, more upwards movement is observed for individuals from a higher socio-economic background. This thesis provides evidence on how young adult’s ability to manage uncertainty and organise their lives is influenced by socio-economic arrangements. In particular, it documents the increasing role of family background and the effects of systematic (dis)advantage among young adults. These findings point to a need for coordination of a wide range of policies that alleviate economic insecurity in the short- and mid-term in order for the younger generation to plan for the long-term future with autonomy.</abstract>", "<keyword>Real-time polymerase chain reaction<sep>Drug resistance<sep>Disease<sep>Neutralization<sep>Mutation<sep>Biological dispersal<sep>Transmission (telecommunications)<sep>Serology<sep>Concordance<sep>Coronavirus<sep>Outbreak<sep>Public health<sep>Lineage (genetic)<sep>Confidence interval<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>Severity of illness<sep>Genotype<sep>Antibody<sep>Comorbidity<sep>Viral shedding<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Pandemic<sep>Multiplex polymerase chain reaction<sep>Rhinovirus<sep>Genome<sep>Polymerase chain reaction<sep>Population<sep>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Retrospective cohort study<sep>Lamivudine<sep>Multiplex<sep>Interquartile range<sep>Odds ratio<sep>Darunavir<sep>Logistic regression<sep>BETA (programming language)<sep>Cost analysis<sep>Transmissibility (structural dynamics)<sep>Regimen<sep>Test (biology)<sep>Genotyping<sep>Lopinavir<sep>Delta<sep>Viral load<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Cross-sectional study<sep>Phenotype<sep>Tuberculosis<sep>Case fatality rate<sep>Cohort<sep>Gene<sep>2019-20 coronavirus outbreak</keyword><title>Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in a young man recovering from traumatic pneumothorax<sep>Emergence and phenotypic characterization of C.1.2, a globally detected lineage that rapidly accumulated mutations of concern<sep>The evolving HIV epidemic and its impact on the HIV testing algorithm: Is it time to change the HIV testing algorithm in South Africa?<sep>Clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 lineages in South Africa<sep>Clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 lineages compared to BA.1 and Delta in South Africa<sep>Emergence and phenotypic characterization of the global SARS-CoV-2 C.1.2 lineage<sep>Rapid epidemic expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in southern Africa<sep>Rapid replacement of the Beta variant by the Delta variant in South Africa<sep>High virological failure rates in HIV-1 perinatally infected children in South Africa: A retrospective cohort study<sep>Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineages BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa<sep>Characterisation of protease resistance mutations in a South African paediatric cohort with virological failure, 2011 - 2017<sep>Identification of SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron variant using spike gene target failure and genotyping assays, Gauteng, South Africa, 2021<sep>Factors influencing the high rejection rates of HIV 1/2 serology samples at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital and the cost implications<sep>HIV self-testing: a cross-sectional survey conducted among students at a tertiary institution in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2020<sep>Characteristics of hospitalised COVID-19 patients during the first two pandemic waves, Gauteng<sep>Immunological and virological outcomes in children on lamivudine monotherapy: A South African public sector experience<sep>Evaluation of a commercial SARS-CoV-2 multiplex PCR genotyping assay for variant identification in resource-scarce settings<sep>Early assessment of the clinical severity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in South Africa<sep>Early assessment of the clinical severity of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in South Africa: a data linkage study</title><abstract>We describe a case of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in an HIV-negative 21-year-old man recovering from abdominal and thoracic trauma. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected at 12 time points over a 95-day span all tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Genotyping revealed canonical beta-variant E484K and N501Y mutations at earlier time points. Human rhinovirus, coronavirus NL63 and respiratory syncytial virus B were detected at different time points by RT-PCR. Full blood analysis at time point 9 (day 82) showed leukopenia with lymphocytosis. The patient’s NP swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 101 days after the first positive test. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in the context of trauma presented here is unique and has important implications for COVID-19 diagnosis, management and policy guidelines<sep>Global genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has identified variants associated with increased transmissibility, neutralization resistance and disease severity. Here we report the emergence of the PANGO lineage C.1.2, detected at low prevalence in South Africa and eleven other countries. The emergence of C.1.2, associated with a high substitution rate, includes changes within the spike protein that have been associated with increased transmissibility or reduced neutralization sensitivity in SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOIs. Like Beta and Delta, C.1.2 shows significantly reduced neutralization sensitivity to plasma from vaccinees and individuals infected with the ancestral D614G virus. In contrast, convalescent donors infected with either Beta or Delta showed high plasma neutralization against C.1.2. These functional data suggest that vaccine efficacy against C.1.2 will be equivalent to Beta and Delta, and that prior infection with either Beta or Delta will likely offer protection against C.1.2.<sep>HIV-1/2 testing is the first step in ensuring HIV-infected individuals are diagnosed and appropriately managed. The impact of suboptimal HIV-1/2 testing algorithms significantly contributes to the increased rates of misdiagnosis of HIV infection. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that high burden countries revise their testing algorithm from a 2 to 3-test testing strategy in the context of an evolving HIV epidemic. Implementation of a new HIV-testing algorithm must be tailor-made within a national framework and must be balanced out with operational feasibility, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of the HIV epidemic and its impact on HIV testing, further we highlight areas of concern in changing from a 2-step to a 3-step test algorithm in the context of South Africa's HIV epidemic and public health program.<sep>Abstract Omicron lineages BA.4 and BA.5 drove a fifth wave of COVID-19 cases in South Africa. We assessed the severity of BA.4/BA.5 infections using the presence/absence of the S-gene target for infections diagnosed using the TaqPath PCR assay between 1 October 2021 and 26 April 2022. We linked national COVID-19 individual-level data including case, laboratory test and hospitalisation data. We assessed severity using multivariable logistic regression comparing the risk of hospitalisation and risk of severe disease, once hospitalised, for Delta, BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 infections. After controlling for factors associated with hospitalisation and severe outcome respectively, BA.4/BA.5-infected individuals had a similar odds of hospitalisation (aOR1.24, 95% CI 0.98–1.55) and severe outcome (aOR 0.71, 95%CI 0.41–1.25) compared to BA.1-infected individuals. Newly emerged Omicron lineages BA.4/BA.5 continue to show reduced clinical severity compared to previous variants, as observed for Omicron BA.1.<sep>Omicron lineages BA.4 and BA.5 drove a fifth wave of COVID-19 cases in South Africa. Here, we use the presence/absence of the S-gene target as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 variant/lineage for infections diagnosed using the TaqPath PCR assay between 1 October 2021 and 26 April 2022. We link national COVID-19 individual-level data including case, laboratory test and hospitalisation data. We assess severity using multivariable logistic regression comparing the risk of hospitalisation and risk of severe disease, once hospitalised, for Delta, BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 infections. After controlling for factors associated with hospitalisation and severe outcome respectively, BA.4/BA.5-infected individuals had a similar odds of hospitalisation (aOR 1.24, 95% CI 0.98-1.55) and severe outcome (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41-1.26) compared to BA.1-infected individuals. Newly emerged Omicron lineages BA.4/BA.5 showed similar severity to the BA.1 lineage and continued to show reduced clinical severity compared to the Delta variant.<sep>Abstract Global genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has identified variants associated with increased transmissibility, neutralization resistance and disease severity. Here we report the emergence of the PANGO lineage C.1.2, detected at low prevalence in South Africa and eleven other countries. The initial C.1.2 detection is associated with a high substitution rate, and includes changes within the spike protein that have been associated with increased transmissibility or reduced neutralization sensitivity in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or variants of interest. Like Beta and Delta, C.1.2 shows significantly reduced neutralization sensitivity to plasma from vaccinees and individuals infected with the ancestral D614G virus. In contrast, convalescent donors infected with either Beta or Delta show high plasma neutralization against C.1.2. These functional data suggest that vaccine efficacy against C.1.2 will be equivalent to Beta and Delta, and that prior infection with either Beta or Delta will likely offer protection against C.1.2.<sep>The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in southern Africa has been characterized by three distinct waves. The first was associated with a mix of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, while the second and third waves were driven by the Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, respectively1-3. In November 2021, genomic surveillance teams in South Africa and Botswana detected a new SARS-CoV-2 variant associated with a rapid resurgence of infections in Gauteng province, South Africa. Within three days of the first genome being uploaded, it was designated a variant of concern (Omicron, B.1.1.529) by the World Health Organization and, within three weeks, had been identified in 87 countries. The Omicron variant is exceptional for carrying over 30 mutations in the spike glycoprotein, which are predicted to influence antibody neutralization and spike function4. Here we describe the genomic profile and early transmission dynamics of Omicron, highlighting the rapid spread in regions with high levels of population immunity.<sep>Abstract The Beta variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in South Africa in late 2020 and rapidly became the dominant variant, causing over 95% of infections in the country during and after the second epidemic wave. Here we show rapid replacement of the Beta variant by the Delta variant, a highly transmissible variant of concern (VOC) that emerged in India and subsequently spread around the world. The Delta variant was imported to South Africa primarily from India, spread rapidly in large monophyletic clusters to all provinces, and became dominant within three months of introduction. This was associated with a resurgence in community transmission, leading to a third wave which was associated with a high number of deaths. We estimated a growth advantage for the Delta variant in South Africa of 0.089 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.084-0.093) per day which corresponds to a transmission advantage of 46% (95% CI 44-48) compared to the Beta variant. These data provide additional support for the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant relative to other VOC and highlight how dynamic shifts in the distribution of variants contribute to the ongoing public health threat.<sep>Background. Large cohorts of HIV-1 perinatally infected children with long-term follow-up in developing countries are limited. Objectives. To explore rates and predictors of virological failure in a paediatric cohort. Methods. A 10-year retrospective study was conducted from January 2004 to December 2013 to determine the incidence of and factors associated with virological failure among 1 659 HIV perinatally infected children in a public sector setting in South Africa (SA). Children aged &lt;17 years who initiated first-line antiretroviral therapy between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2013 and had at least 5 years of HIV viral load measurements were eligible. Results. The 1 659 children contributed 7 075 person-years of follow-up (PYFU). In the initial cohort of 2 024 children, 51.0% were male and 62.0% were aged &lt;5 years. The incidence of virological failure was 18.7 per 100 PYFU. Virological failure was associated with male gender, death of the mother, concurrent tuberculosis treatment and World Health Organization stage IV disease. Of the 320 HIV isolates successfully amplified, 249 (77.8%) had drug resistance mutations. Conclusions. We observed high rates of virological failure and emergence of HIV drug resistance mutations. Despite gains made by SA in the treatment of HIV, such results challenge the country’s ability to meet global targets of 90% viral suppression by 2020.<sep>Three lineages (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant of concern predominantly drove South Africa's fourth Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) wave. We have now identified two new lineages, BA.4 and BA.5, responsible for a fifth wave of infections. The spike proteins of BA.4 and BA.5 are identical, and similar to BA.2 except for the addition of 69-70 deletion (present in the Alpha variant and the BA.1 lineage), L452R (present in the Delta variant), F486V and the wild-type amino acid at Q493. The two lineages differ only outside of the spike region. The 69-70 deletion in spike allows these lineages to be identified by the proxy marker of S-gene target failure, on the background of variants not possessing this feature. BA.4 and BA.5 have rapidly replaced BA.2, reaching more than 50% of sequenced cases in South Africa by the first week of April 2022. Using a multinomial logistic regression model, we estimated growth advantages for BA.4 and BA.5 of 0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08-0.09) and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.09-0.11) per day, respectively, over BA.2 in South Africa. The continued discovery of genetically diverse Omicron lineages points to the hypothesis that a discrete reservoir, such as human chronic infections and/or animal hosts, is potentially contributing to further evolution and dispersal of the virus.<sep>Advances in HIV management have improved treatment outcomes in the HIV-infected population. However, these advances have not been without multifaceted challenges. In sub-Saharan Africa, their impact is reflected in the increased emergence of HIV drug resistance mutations. With the rise in exposure of children to protease inhibitors (PIs), the possibility of increasing PI resistance remains a concern.To describe a group of antiretroviral-experienced children with PI drug resistance mutations after failure on first- or second-line regimens in a public sector setting in South Africa.This was a retrospective cohort study of 22 children perinatally infected with HIV who had HIV genotyping conducted between January 2011 and December 2017.Of the 236 children who had HIV genotyping conducted, 22 (9.3%) had evidence of HIV PI resistance mutations. Twenty-one of the 22 children (95.5%) had major mutations in the protease region of the HIV genome. Of these children, 66.7% (14/21) had loss of response to both boosted lopinavir and atazanavir, with boosted darunavir remaining susceptible in only 12 (57.1%). The most frequent major PI mutations were V82A (76.2%), M46I/M46L (76.2%), I54V (62.0%) and L76V (33.3%).We observed a high rate of PI resistance mutations, with a resulting loss of PIs that could be used in construction of third-line regimens. To build on improvements from the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, increased efforts are needed by both health professionals and caregivers to improve adherence measures in children perinatally infected with HIV.<sep>The circulation of Omicron BA.1 led to the rapid increase in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in South Africa in November 2021, which warranted the use of more rapid detection methods. We, therefore, assessed the ability to detect Omicron BA.1 using genotyping assays to identify specific mutations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, Gauteng province, South Africa. The TaqPath™ COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was performed on all samples selected to identify spike gene target failure (SGTF). SARS-CoV-2 genotyping assays were used for the detection of del69/70 and K417N mutation. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on a subset of genotyped samples to confirm these findings. Of the positive samples received, 11.0% (175/1589) were randomly selected to assess if SGTF and genotyping assays, that detect del69/70 and K417N mutations, could identify Omicron BA.1. We identified SGTF in 98.9% (173/175) of samples, of which 88.0% (154/175) had both the del69/70 and K417N mutation. The genotyped samples (45.7%; 80/175) that were sequenced confirmed Omicron BA.1 (97.5%; 78/80). Our data show that genotyping for the detection of the del69/70 and K417N coupled with SGTF is efficient to exclude Alpha and Beta variants and rapidly detect Omicron BA.1. However, we still require assays for the detection of unique mutations that will allow for the differentiation between other Omicron sublineages. Therefore, the use of genotyping assays to detect new dominant or emerging lineages of SARS-CoV-2 will be beneficial<sep>HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is one of the most requested test sets within Virology and forms an essential part of patient management. Assessment of the rejection criteria is a key quality indicator, crucial for improving laboratory services and efficiency to ensure accurate and reliable results.The aim of this study was to identify the factors that influence the HIV 1/2 serology rejection rates (RR) at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital and to evaluate the associated costs.A retrospective study was conducted (June to December 2019) to identify the RR and rejection criteria of HIV serology samples throughout the total testing process. Descriptive analysis using percentages and frequencies was used to analyse the RR by phase, health establishment, ward and healthcare professional. A cost analysis incorporating minor and major costs was modelled in each phase of testing, and the total cost of rejections was calculated.A total of 6678 tests were received, and 738 were rejected (RR = 11.1%). The pre-analytical phase contributed significantly to the overall RR, with the requirement of a separate sample (57.44%) the most common reason for rejection. The total cost per rejected test was $2.47, which amounted to a total rejection cost of $197.55, of which $158.18 was caused by the pre-analytical rejection criteria.High RR of HIV tests were noted, resulting in significant cost wastage. Identification and analysis of rejections must be implemented across all laboratories to improve the efficiency of<sep>Background. Despite the growing evidence for reasonable acceptance and the willingness to use HIVST, South Africa has not yet fully explored HIVST. Objective. This study’s objective was to determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices for HIVST among students aged 18 to 29 years from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. Methods. An online cross-sectional self-administered survey was used to collect data from 01 January 2020 to 31 June 2020. Chi-squared test was used to determine the contribution between categorical variables and HIVST outcomes at a p-value of ≤0.05. Logistic regression was performed to analyse the association between categorical variables with HIVST at a 95% confidence interval. Results. A total of 227 students were included and more than half were females and 68% were between 20 and 24 years of age. Only 15% reported prior access to HIVST. Almost all students (99%) indicated that they would confirm self-test results if positive. The students 25-29 year olds were most likely (aOR: 34; 95% CI: 2 – 452) to have had previously used HIVST compared to younger age groups. Conclusion. HIVST awareness was generally high among this study population. Of concern is the extremely low number of students who had previously used HIVST, as well as those who were unaware of HIVST's existence. Our findings highlight a necessity for HIVST advocacy in South Africa that provides information on where and how HIVST kits can be accessed to<sep>Gauteng province (GP) was one of the most affected provinces in the country during the first two pandemic waves in South Africa. We aimed to describe the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted in one of the largest quaternary hospitals in GP during the first two waves.Study objectives were to determine factors associated with hospital admission during the second wave and to describe factors associated with in-hospital COVID-19 mortality.Data from a national hospital-based surveillance system of COVID-19 hospitalisations were used. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to compare patients hospitalised during wave 1 and wave 2, and to determine factors associated with in-hospital mortality.The case fatality ratio was the highest (39.95%) during wave 2. Factors associated with hospitalisation included age groups 40-59 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-4.27), 60-79 years (aOR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.23-5.02) and ≥ 80 years (aOR: 3.39, 95% CI: 1.35-8.49). Factors associated with in-hospital mortality included age groups 60-79 years (aOR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.11-5.84) and ≥ 80 years (aOR: 5.66, 95% CI: 2.12-15.08); male sex (aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.22-1.99); presence of an underlying comorbidity (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37-2.26), as well as being admitted during post-wave 2 (aOR: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.33-4.42).Compared to the recent omicron-driven pandemic waves characterised by lower admission rates and less disease severity among younger patients, COVID-19 in-hospital mortality during the earlier waves was associated with<sep>In resource-limited settings, holding regimens such as lamivudine monotherapy (LAM) have been used to manage HIV-positive children failing combination antiretroviral therapy to mitigate the risk of drug resistance developing, while adherence barriers are addressed or when access to second- or third-line regimens is restricted. South African HIV treatment guidelines previously advocated the use of LAM to manage HIV-infected children with virological failure. However, the outcomes of patients on LAM compared with those who continued on a failing regimen have not been well described. Objectives. To investigate characteristics of a large cohort of children placed on LAM and their outcomes. Methods. This was a retrospective review of children with virological failure and the documented M184V drug resistance mutation who were placed on LAM v. a control group of children who continued on a failing regimen despite persistent virological failure. Virological and immunological outcomes of LAM were compared with those in patients who remained on a failing regimen. Results. A total of 179 children were included in the analysis, with 92 in the LAM group and 87 in the control group. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) age at baseline was 9.2 (5.4 - 12) years, the median CD4 count was 384 (184 - 622) cells/μL, and the median HIV viral load was 4.7 (IQR 3.7 - 5.3) log10. Twenty-two children (25.6%) in the LAM group and 15 (17.4%) in the control group experienced immunological deterioration.<sep>The rapid emergence and spread of numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants across the globe underscores the crucial need for continuous SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to ensure that potentially more pathogenic variants are detected early and contained. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is currently the gold standard for COVID-19 surveillance; however, it remains cost-prohibitive and requires specialized technical skills. To increase surveillance capacity, especially in resource-scarce settings, supplementary methods that are cost- and time-effective are needed. Real-time multiplex PCR genotyping assays offer an economical and fast solution for screening circulating and emerging variants while simultaneously complementing existing WGS approaches. In this study we evaluated the AllplexTM SARS-CoV-2 Variants II multiplex real-time PCR genotyping assay, Seegene (South Korea), and implemented it in retrospectively characterizing circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in a rural South African setting between April and October 2021, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa. The AllplexTM SARS-CoV-2 Variants II real-time PCR assay demonstrated perfect concordance with whole-genome sequencing in detecting Beta and Delta variants and exhibited high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility. Implementation of the assay in characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants between April and October 2021 in a rural South African setting revealed a rapid shift from the Beta to the Delta variant between April and June. All specimens successfully genotyped in April were Beta variants and the Delta variant was not detected until May. By June, 78% of samples<sep>ABSTRACT Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern (VOC) almost completely replaced other variants in South Africa during November 2021, and was associated with a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases. We aimed to assess clinical severity of individuals infected with Omicron, using S Gene Target Failure (SGTF) on the Thermo Fisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 PCR test as a proxy. Methods We performed data linkages for (i) SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests, (ii) COVID-19 case data, (iii) genome data, and (iv) the DATCOV national hospital surveillance system for the whole of South Africa. For cases identified using Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 PCR, infections were designated as SGTF or non-SGTF. Disease severity was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models comparing SGTF-infected individuals diagnosed between 1 October to 30 November to (i) non-SGTF in the same period, and (ii) Delta infections diagnosed between April and November 2021. Results From 1 October through 6 December 2021, 161,328 COVID-19 cases were reported nationally; 38,282 were tested using TaqPath PCR and 29,721 SGTF infections were identified. The proportion of SGTF infections increased from 3% in early October (week 39) to 98% in early December (week 48). On multivariable analysis, after controlling for factors associated with hospitalisation, individuals with SGTF infection had lower odds of being admitted to hospital compared to non-SGTF infections (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.3). Among hospitalised individuals, after controlling for factors associated with<sep>BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant of concern was identified in South Africa in November, 2021, and was associated with an increase in COVID-19 cases. We aimed to assess the clinical severity of infections with the omicron variant using S gene target failure (SGTF) on the Thermo Fisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 PCR test as a proxy.MethodsWe did data linkages for national, South African COVID-19 case data, SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test data, SARS-CoV-2 genome data, and COVID-19 hospital admissions data. For individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 via TaqPath PCR tests, infections were designated as either SGTF or non-SGTF. The delta variant was identified by genome sequencing. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we assessed disease severity and hospitalisations by comparing individuals with SGTF versus non-SGTF infections diagnosed between Oct 1 and Nov 30, 2021, and we further assessed disease severity by comparing SGTF-infected individuals diagnosed between Oct 1 and Nov 30, 2021, with delta variant-infected individuals diagnosed between April 1 and Nov 9, 2021.FindingsFrom Oct 1 (week 39), 2021, to Dec 6 (week 49), 2021, 161 328 cases of COVID-19 were reported in South Africa. 38 282 people were diagnosed via TaqPath PCR tests and 29 721 SGTF infections and 1412 non-SGTF infections were identified. The proportion of SGTF infections increased from two (3·2%) of 63 in week 39 to 21 978 (97·9%) of 22 455 in week 48.

Although ML predictions are primarily useful for interpolation and many applications, early design stages require flexibility due to uncertain parameter values and vaguely defined building forms.

While ANN uses numerical parameters to represent building shape,<sep>In the literature, the plane-strain assumption usually forms the basis of inverse analyses of excavations, mainly due to the high computational cost of 3D analyses. In this paper, a procedure that quantifies three-dimensional effects of excavation is proposed.

Models are usually conservative and contain many parameters and sources of systematic uncertainty, which need to be taken into account for accurate model updating.

Low replacement and retrofitting rates of urban housing mean that many buildings do not comply with seismic actions defined in present-day seismic codes and thus, important post- seismic assessment activities are still to be expected.

However, effects rather than causes are often measured in complex urban systems, requiring robust data-interpretation methodologies.

Thermodynamic and dynamic processes alter the sea ice thickness. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition provided a unique opportunity to study seasonal sea ice thickness changes of the same sea ice. We analyzed 11 large-scale (∼50 km) airborne electromagnetic sea thickness and surface roughness surveys from October 2019 to September 2020. Data from ice mass balance and position buoys provided additional information. We found that thermodynamic growth and decay dominated the seasonal cycle with a total mean sea<sep>Abstract.

Melt ponds are a core component of the summer sea ice system in the Arctic, increasing the uptake of solar energy and impacting the ice-associated ecosystem. They were thus one of the key topics during the one-year drift campaign MOSAiC in the Transpolar Drift 2019/2020. Pond depth is a dominating factor in the description of the surface meltwater volume, necessary to estimate budgets, and used in model parametrization to simulate pond coverage evolution. However, observational data on pond depth is spatially and temporally strongly limited to a few in situ measurements. Pond bathymetry, which is pond<sep>Abstract. In September 2019, the research icebreaker Polarstern started the largest multidisciplinary Arctic expedition to date, the MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) drift experiment.

The majority of affected individuals have variable, though often severe cognitive and motor delay, with a complex movement disorder and high risk of premature mortality. For most, standard pharmacological treatment provides only limited clinical benefit. Promising gene therapy approaches are emerging, though may not be either suitable or easily accessible for all patients. To characterize the underlying disease pathophysiology and guide precision therapies, we generated a patient-derived midbrain dopaminergic neuronal model of AADC deficiency from induced pluripotent stem cells. The neuronal model recapitulates key disease features, including absent AADC enzyme activity and dysregulated dopamine metabolism. We observed developmental defects affecting synaptic maturation and neuronal electrical properties, which were improved by lentiviral gene therapy. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses on recombinant AADC predicted that the activity of one variant could be improved by l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) administration; this hypothesis was corroborated in the patient-derived neuronal model, where l-DOPA treatment leads to amelioration of dopamine metabolites. Our study has shown that patient-derived disease modelling provides further insight into the neurodevelopmental sequelae of AADC deficiency, as well as a robust platform to investigate and develop personalized therapeutic approaches.<sep>Pediatric live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) surgery is by itself a complicated surgery. Added to the difficulty in the operative technique are the complex preoperative work-up, optimization, and postoperative treatment. Intraoperative events and immediate postoperative recovery are important in graft function and the patient's overall recovery. Intraoperative greenish-blue urine and hypoxia are seldom seen during this period in the case of LDLT. Knowing the differential diagnosis and treatment are of predominant importance.A case of decompensated chronic liver disease due to Wilson's disease underwent routine LDLT. Here we describe an uncommon complication, methemoglobinemia, which complicated this patient's recovery. The case is presented for the condition's rarity and the confusing clinical picture it produced.Observations of greenish-blue urine, ascites, serum, gastric aspirate, bile, maroon or brown-colored blood, and hypoxia with normal PaO2 were made in this case. Timely diagnosis of suspected drug-induced methemoglobinemia and treatment, which led to the uneventful recovery of the patient, are explained.Even though methemoglobinemia does not have a direct graft effect, it can affect the graft oxygen perfusion and the overall oxygenation of the postoperative patient, causing adverse impacts if not detected and treated promptly. No such association of methemoglobinemia with Wilson's disease or during transplantation has been reported in the literature so far.<sep>Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin. Here, by a combination of bioinformatic predictions and analyses, phosphorylation assays, spectroscopic investigations and activity measurements, we determined that Ser-193, a conserved residue located at the active site, can be phosphorylated, increasing catalytic efficiency. In order to determine the molecular basis for this functional improvement, we determined the structural and kinetic properties of the site-directed variants S193A, S193D and S193E. While S193A retains 27% of the catalytic efficiency of wild-type, the two acidic side chain variants are impaired in catalysis with efficiencies of about 0.15% with respect to the wild-type. Thus, even if located at the active site, Ser-193 is not essential for enzyme activity. We advance the idea that this residue is fundamental for the correct architecture of the active site in terms of network of interactions triggering catalysis. This role has been compared with the properties of the Ser-194 of the highly homologous enzyme histidine decarboxylase whose catalytic loop is visible in the spatial structure, allowing us to propose the validation for the effect of the phosphorylation. The effect could be interesting for AADC deficiency, a rare monogenic disease, whose broad clinical phenotype could be also related to post translational AADC modifications.<sep>Compound heterozygosis is the most diffuse and hardly to tackle condition in aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency, a genetic disease leading to severe neurological impairment. Here, by using an appropriate vector, we succeeded in obtaining high yields of AADC protein and characterizing two new heterodimers, T69M/S147R and C281W/M362T, detected in two AADC deficiency patients. We performed an extensive biochemical characterization of the heterodimeric recombinant proteins and of the related homodimers, by a combination of dichroic and fluorescence spectroscopy and activity assays together with bioinformatic analyses. We found that T69M/S147R exhibits negative complementation in terms of activity but it is more stable than the average of the homodimeric counterparts. The heterodimer C281W/M362T retains a nearly good catalytic efficiency, whereas M362T homodimer is less affected and C281W homodimer is recovered as insoluble. These results, which are consistent with the related phenotypes, and the data emerging from previous studies, suggest that the severity of AADC deficiency is not directly explained by positive or negative complementation phenomena, but rather depends on: i) the integrity of one or both active sites; ii) the structural and functional properties of the entire pool of AADC proteins expressed. Overall, this integrated and cross-sectional approach enables proper characterization and depicts the functional result of subunit interactions in the dimeric structure and will help to elucidate the physio-pathological mechanisms in AADC deficiency.<sep>Human aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of dopamine and serotonin, essential neurotransmitters involved in motor and cognitive abilities. Mutations in its gene lead to AADC deficiency, a monogenic rare neurometabolic childhood parkinsonism characterized by severe motor and neurodevelopmental symptoms. Here, for the first time, we solved the crystal structure of human holoAADC in the internal aldimine (1.9 Å) and in the external aldimine (2.4 Å) of the substrate analog L-Dopa methylester. In this intermediate, the highly flexible AADC catalytic loop (CL) is captured in a closed state contacting all protein domains. In addition, each active site, composed by residues of both subunits, is connected to the other through weak interactions and a central cavity. By combining crystallographic analyses with all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, SAXS investigations and limited proteolysis experiments, we realized that the functionally obligate homodimeric AADC enzyme in solution is an elongated, asymmetric molecule, where the fluctuations of the CL are coupled to flexibility at the edge between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The structural integrity of this peripheral protein region is essential to catalysis, as assessed by both artificial and 37 AADC deficiency pathogenic variants leading to the interpretation that structural dynamics in protein regions far from the active site is essential for CL flexibility and the acquirement of a correct catalytically competent structure. This could represent the molecular basis for pathogenicity prediction in AADC deficiency.<sep>Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) is the third most abundant cytoplasmic protein in red blood cells. Prx2 belongs to a well-known family of antioxidants, the peroxiredoxins (Prxs), that are widely expressed in mammalian cells. Prx2 is a typical, homodimeric, 2-Cys Prx that uses two cysteine residues to accomplish the task of detoxifying a vast range of organic peroxides, H2O2, and peroxynitrite. Although progress has been made on functional characterization of Prx2, much still remains to be investigated on Prx2 post-translational changes. Here, we first show that Prx2 is Tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylated by Syk in red cells exposed to oxidation induced by diamide. We identified Tyr-193 in both recombinant Prx2 and native Prx2 from red cells as a specific target of Syk. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-193 allows Prx2 conformational change that is more favorable for its peroxidase activity. Indeed, Syk-induced Tyr phosphorylation of Prx2 enhances in vitro Prx2 activity, but also contributes to Prx2 translocation to the membrane of red cells exposed to diamide. The biologic importance of Tyr-193 phospho-Prx2 is further supported by data on red cells from a mouse model of humanized sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is globally distributed, hereditary red cell disorder, characterized by severe red cell oxidation due to the pathologic sickle hemoglobin. SCD red cells show Tyr-phosphorylated Prx2 bound to the membrane and increased Prx2 activity when compared to healthy erythrocytes. Collectively, our data highlight the novel link between redox related signaling and Prx2 function in normal and diseased red cells.<sep>AADC deficiency is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate dependent enzyme responsible for the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin. Here, following a biochemical approach together with an in silico bioinformatic analysis, we present a structural and functional characterization of 13 new variants of AADC. The amino acid substitutions are spread over the entire protein from the N-terminal (V60A), to its loop1 (H70Y and F77L), to the large domain (G96R) and its various motifs, i.e. loop2 (A110E), or a core β-barrel either on the surface (P210L, F251S and E283A) or in a more hydrophobic milieu (L222P, F237S and W267R) or loop3 (L353P), and to the C-terminal domain (R453C). Results show that the β-barrel variants exhibit a low solubility and those belonging to the surface tend to aggregate in their apo form, leading to the identification of a new enzymatic phenotype for AADC deficiency. Moreover, five variants of residues belonging to the large interface of AADC (V60A, G96R, A110E, L353P and R453C) are characterized by a decreased catalytic efficiency. The remaining ones (H70Y and F77L) present features typical of apo-to-holo impaired transition. Thus, defects in catalysis or in the acquirement of the correct holo structure are due not only to specific local domain effects but also to long-range effects at either the protein surface or the subunit interface. Altogether, the new characterized enzymatic phenotypes represent a further step in the elucidation of the molecular basis for the disease.<sep>Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare monogenic disease due to mutations in the ddc gene producing AADC, a homodimeric pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme. The disorder is often fatal in the first decade and is characterized by profound motor impairments and developmental delay. In the last two years, there has been a net rise in the number of patients and variants identified, maybe also pushed by the ongoing gene therapy trials. The majority of the identified genotypes are compound heterozygous (about 70%). Efforts are underway to reach early diagnosis, find possible new markers/new fast methods, and predict clinical outcome. However, no clear correlation of genotype-to-phenotype exists to date. Nevertheless, for homozygous patients, reliable results have been obtained using genetic methods combined with available computational tools on crystal structures corroborated by biochemical investigations on recombinant homodimeric AADC variants that have been obtained and characterized in solution. For these variants, the molecular basis for the defect has been suggested and validated, since it correlates quite well with mildness/severity of the homozygous phenotype. Instead, prediction for compound heterozygous patients is more difficult since complementation effects could happen. Here, by analyzing the existing literature on compound heterozygosity in AADC deficiency and other genetic disorders, we highlight that, in order to assess pathogenicity, the measurement of activity of the AADC heterodimeric variant should be integrated by bioinformatic, structural, and functional data on the whole protein constellation theoretically present in such patients. A wider discussion on symptomatic heterozygosity in AADC deficiency is also presented.<sep>Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the DDC gene and mainly characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and oculogyric crises. Early diagnosis is crucial for correct patient management; however, many patients remain misdiagnosed or undiagnosed due to the rarity and clinical heterogeneity of the disorder especially in the milder forms. Here, we applied exome sequencing approach by screening 2000 paediatric patients with neurodevelopmental disorders to identify possible new AADC variants and AADC deficiency patients. We identified five distinct DDC variants in two unrelated individuals. Patient #1 harboured two compound heterozygous DDC variants: c.436-12T > C and c.435&nbsp;+&nbsp;24A&gt;C and presented with psychomotor delay, tonic spasms, and hyperreactivity. Patient #2 had three homozygous AADC variants: c.1385G > A; p.Arg462Gln, c.234C > T; p.Ala78 = , and c.201 + 37A > G and presented with developmental delay and myoclonic seizures. The variants were classified as benign class I variants and therefore non-causative according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines. Since the AADC protein is a structural and functional obligate homodimer, we evaluated the possible AADC polypeptide chain combinations in the two patients and determined the effects resulting from the amino acid substitution Arg462Gln. Our patients carrying DDC variants presented clinical manifestations not precisely overlapped to the classical symptoms exhibited by the most severe AADC deficiency cases. However, screening data derived from exome sequencing in patients featuring wide-range symptoms related to neurodevelopmental disorders may help to identify AADC deficiency patients, especially when applied to larger cohorts.<sep>Abstract Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare monogenic disease, often fatal in the first decade, causing severe intellectual disability, movement disorders and autonomic dysfunction. It is due to mutations in the gene coding for the AADC enzyme responsible for the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin. Using whole exome sequencing, we have identified a novel homozygous c.989C &gt; T (p.Pro330Leu) variant of AADC causing AADC deficiency. Pro330 is part of an essential structural and functional element: the flexible catalytic loop suggested to cover the active site as a lid and properly position the catalytic residues. Our investigations provide evidence that Pro330 concurs in the achievement of an optimal catalytic competence. Through a combination of bioinformatic approaches, dynamic light scattering measurements, limited proteolysis experiments, spectroscopic and in solution analyses, we demonstrate that the substitution of Pro330 with Leu, although not determining gross conformational changes, results in an enzymatic species that is highly affected in catalysis with a decarboxylase catalytic efficiency decreased by 674- and 194-fold for the two aromatic substrates. This defect does not lead to active site structural disassembling, nor to the inability to bind the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. The molecular basis for the pathogenic effect of this variant is rather due to a mispositioning of the catalytically competent external aldimine intermediate, as corroborated by spectroscopic analyses and pH dependence of the kinetic parameters. Altogether, we determined the structural basis for the severity of the manifestation of AADC deficiency in this patient and discussed the rationale for a precision therapy.<sep>Abstract The versatility of reactions catalyzed by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) enzymes is largely due to the chemistry of their extraordinary catalyst. PLP is necessary for many reactions involving amino acids. Reaction specificity is controlled by the orientation of the external aldimine intermediate that is formed upon addition of the amino acidic substrate to the coenzyme. The breakage of a specific bond of the external aldimine gives rise to a carbanionic intermediate. From this point, the different reaction pathways diverge leading to multiple activities: transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, elimination, and synthesis. A significant novelty appeared approximately 30 years ago when it was reported that some PLP-dependent decarboxylases are able to consume molecular oxygen transforming an amino acid into a carbonyl compound. These side paracatalytic reactions could be particularly relevant for human health, also considering that some of these enzymes are responsible for the synthesis of important neurotransmitters such as γ-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, and serotonin, whose dysregulation under oxidative conditions could have important implications in neurodegenerative states. However, the reactivity of PLP enzymes with dioxygen is not confined to mammals/animals. In fact, some plant PLP decarboxylases have been reported to catalyze oxidative reactions producing carbonyl compounds. Moreover, other recent reports revealed the existence of new oxidase activities catalyzed by new PLP enzymes, MppP, RohP, Ind4, CcbF, PvdN, Cap15, and CuaB. These PLP enzymes belong to the bacterial and fungal kingdoms and are present in organisms synthesizing bioactive compounds. These new PLP activities are not paracatalytic and could only scratch the surface on a wider and unexpected catalytic capability of PLP enzymes.<sep>Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting the biosynthesis of dopamine, a precursor of both norepinephrine and epinephrine, and serotonin. Diagnosis is based on the analysis of CSF or plasma metabolites, AADC activity in plasma and genetic testing for variants in the DDC gene. The exact prevalence of AADC deficiency, the number of patients, and the variant and genotype prevalence are not known. Here, we present the DDC variant (n = 143) and genotype (n = 151) prevalence of 348 patients with AADC deficiency, 121 of whom were previously not reported. In addition, we report 26 new DDC variants, classify them according to the ACMG/AMP/ACGS recommendations for pathogenicity and score them based on the predicted structural effect. The splice variant c.714+4A>T, with a founder effect in Taiwan and China, was the most common variant (allele frequency = 32.4%), and c.[714+4A>T];[714+4A>T] was the most common genotype (genotype frequency = 21.3%). Approximately 90% of genotypes had variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, while 7% had one VUS allele and 3% had two VUS alleles. Only one benign variant was reported. Homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes were interpreted in terms of AADC protein and categorized as: i) devoid of full-length AADC, ii) bearing one type of AADC homodimeric variant or iii) producing an AADC protein population composed of two homodimeric and one heterodimeric variant. Based on structural features, a score was attributed for all homodimers, and a tentative prediction was advanced for the heterodimer. Almost all AADC protein variants were pathogenic or likely pathogenic.<sep>Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder leading to severe combined serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine deficiency. We report on a female patient with borderline functioning and sporadic clear-cut focal to bilateral seizures from age 10 years. A neuropsychological assessment highlighted a mild impairment in executive functions, affecting attention span and visual–spatial abilities. Following the diagnosis of epilepsy with a presumed genetic etiology, we applied a diagnostic approach inclusive of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel, which uncovered two variants in trans in the DOPA decarboxylase ( DDC ) gene underlying an AADC deficiency. This compound heterozygous genotype was associated with a mild reduction of homovanillic acid, a low level of the norepinephrine catabolite, and a significant reduction of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid. Remarkably, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) and 5-hydroxytryptophan were instead increased. During the genetically guided re-evaluation process, some mild signs of dysautonomic dysfunction (nasal congestion, abnormal sweating, hypotension and fainting, excessive sleepiness, small hands and feet, and increased levels of prolactin, tiredness, and fatigue), more typical of AADC deficiency, were evaluated with new insight. Of the two AADC variants, the R347Q has already been characterized as a loss-of-function with severe catalytic impairments, while the novel L391P variant has been predicted to have a less severe impact. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that the amino acid substitution may affect affinity for the PLP coenzyme. Thus, the genotype corresponds to a phenotype with mild and late-onset symptoms, of which seizures were the clinical sign, leading to medical attention. This case report expands the spectrum of AADC deficiency phenotypes to encompass a less-disabling clinical condition including borderline cognitive functioning, drug-responsive epilepsy, and mild autonomic dysfunction.</abstract>", "<keyword>Paraformaldehyde<sep>Interactome<sep>Personalized medicine<sep>Epigenetics<sep>Herpes simplex virus<sep>Dynamics (music)<sep>Protein–protein

Here we report that cannabidiol (CBD), a compound produced by the cannabis plant, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. CBD and its metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, but not congeneric cannabinoids, potently block SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells. CBD acts after cellular infection, inhibiting viral gene expression and reversing many effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host gene transcription.

A cohort of human patients previously taking CBD had significantly lower<sep>Targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 Inside host cells, the RNA genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is translated into two polyproteins that are cleaved to give the individual viral proteins. The main viral protease, known as Mpro or 3CLpro, plays a key role in these cleavages, making it an important drug target.

It is unclear how exposure to inflammatory stimuli alters transcriptional responses to subsequent stimulus. Using high-throughput microfluidic live-cell analysis, we systematically profile the NF-κB response to different signal sequences in single cells. We find that NF-κB dynamics store the short-term history of received signals: depending on the prior pathogenic or cytokine signal, the NF-κB response to subsequent stimuli varies from no response to full activation. Using information theory, we reveal that these stimulus-dependent<sep>Individual cells show great heterogeneity when responding to environmental cues. For example, under cytokine stimulation some cells activate immune signaling pathways while others completely ignore the signal.

Despite the diversity of dynamic signals produced by pathogens and sentinel cells, information-processing pathways converge on a limited number of central signaling nodes to ultimately control cellular responses. In particular, the NF-κB pathway responds to dozens of signals from pathogens and self, and plays a vital role in processing proinflammatory inputs.

How differences in cytokine secretion affect inflammatory signaling over space and how responding cells decode information from propagating cytokines are not understood. By computationally and experimentally studying NF-κB dynamics in cocultures of signal-sending cells (macrophages) and signal-receiving cells (fibroblasts), we find that cytokine signals are transmitted by wave-like propagation of NF-κB activity and create well-defined activation zones in responding cells.

This is often achieved through adjuvants, molecules that usually activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and stimulate two innate immune signaling pathways: the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells pathway (NF-κB) and the interferon regulatory factors pathway (IRF).

During early embryogenesis, DUX4 is crucial for maternal to zygotic transition at the 2-8-cell stage in order to overcome silencing of genes and enable transcription from the zygotic genome. In adult somatic cells, DUX4 expression is silenced and its activation in adult muscle cells causes the genetic disorder Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD).

It has been proposed that immune system dysregulation/over-stimulation may be implicated, but it is not clear how such processes would lead to respiratory failure. We performed comprehensive multiparameter immune monitoring in a tightly controlled cohort of 128 COVID-19 patients, and used the ratio of oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2 / FiO2) as a physiologic measure of disease severity.

Here, we<sep>There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs.

However, non-canonical rearrangements (NCRs) such as deletions, insertions, and inversions have the potential to trigger genomic instability. In the case of DNA viruses, NCRs can lead to generation of defective viral genomes (DVGs).

Yet any information stored on our genes is useless without its correct interpretation. The genetic code defines the rule set to decode this information. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are at the heart of this process. We extensively characterize how these enzymes distinguish all natural amino acids based on the computational analysis of crystallographic structure data. The results of this meta-analysis show that the correct read-out of genetic information is a delicate interplay between the composition of the binding site, non-covalent interactions, error correction mechanisms, and steric effects.<sep>Artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated their potential role in predictive chemistry and synthetic planning of small molecules; there are at least a few reports of companies employing in silico synthetic planning into their overall approach to accessing target molecules. A data-driven synthesis planning program is one component being developed and evaluated by the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis (MLPDS) consortium, comprising MIT and 13 chemical and pharmaceutical company members. Together, we wrote this perspective to share how we think predictive models can be integrated into medicinal chemistry synthesis workflows, how they are currently used within MLPDS member companies, and the outlook for this field.<sep>Abstract With the growth of protein structure data, the analysis of molecular interactions between ligands and their target molecules is gaining importance. PLIP, the protein–ligand interaction profiler, detects and visualises these interactions and provides data in formats suitable for further processing. PLIP has proven very successful in applications ranging from the characterisation of docking experiments to the assessment of novel ligand–protein complexes. Besides ligand–protein interactions, interactions with DNA and RNA play a vital role in many applications, such as drugs targeting DNA or RNA-binding proteins. To date, over 7% of all 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank include DNA or RNA. Therefore, we extended PLIP to encompass these important molecules. We demonstrate the power of this extension with examples of a cancer drug binding to a DNA target, and an RNA–protein complex central to a neurological disease. PLIP is available online at https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de and as open source code. So far, the engine has served over a million queries and the source code has been downloaded several thousand times.<sep>Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), affects nearly eight million people worldwide. There are currently only limited treatment options, which cause several side effects and have drug resistance. Thus, there is a great need for a novel, improved Chagas treatment. Bifunctional enzyme dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) has emerged as a promising pharmacological target. Moreover, some human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR) inhibitors such as trimetrexate also inhibit T. cruzi DHFR-TS (TcDHFR-TS). These compounds serve as a starting point and a reference in a screening campaign to search for new TcDHFR-TS inhibitors. In this paper, a novel virtual screening approach was developed that combines classical docking with protein-ligand interaction profiling to identify drug repositioning opportunities against T. cruzi infection. In this approach, some food and drug administration (FDA)-approved drugs that were predicted to bind with high affinity to TcDHFR-TS and whose predicted molecular interactions are conserved among known inhibitors were selected. Overall, ten putative TcDHFR-TS inhibitors were identified. These exhibited a similar interaction profile and a higher computed binding affinity, compared to trimetrexate. Nilotinib, glipizide, glyburide and gliquidone were tested on T. cruzi epimastigotes and showed growth inhibitory activity in the micromolar range. Therefore, these compounds could lead to the development of new treatment options for Chagas disease.<sep>Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions of people in South America. The current treatments are limited, have severe side effects, and are only partially effective. Drug repositioning, defined as finding new indications for already approved drugs, has the potential to provide new therapeutic options for Chagas. In this work, we conducted a structure-based drug repositioning approach with over 130,000 3D protein structures to identify drugs that bind therapeutic Chagas targets and thus represent potential new Chagas treatments. The screening yielded over 500 molecules as hits, out of which 38 drugs were prioritized following a rigorous filtering process. About half of the latter were already known to have trypanocidal activity, while the others are novel to Chagas disease. Three of the new drug candidates—ciprofloxacin, naproxen, and folic acid—showed a growth inhibitory activity in the micromolar range when tested ex vivo on T. cruzi trypomastigotes, validating the prediction. We show that our drug repositioning approach is able to pinpoint relevant drug candidates at a fraction of the time and cost of a conventional screening. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the power and potential of structure-based drug repositioning in the context of neglected tropical diseases where the pharmaceutical industry has little financial interest in the development of new drugs.<sep>Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a frequent cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease (PD) and have been associated with familial and sporadic PD. Reducing the kinase activity of LRRK2 is a promising therapeutic strategy since pathogenic mutations increase the kinase activity. Several small-molecule LRRK2 inhibitors are currently under investigation for the treatment of PD. However, drug discovery and development are always accompanied by high costs and a risk of late failure. The use of already approved drugs for a new indication, which is known as drug repositioning, can reduce the cost and risk. In this study, we applied a structure-based drug repositioning approach to identify new LRRK2 inhibitors that are already approved for a different indication. In a large-scale structure-based screening, we compared the protein–ligand interaction patterns of known LRRK2 inhibitors with protein–ligand complexes in the PDB. The screening yielded 6 drug repositioning candidates. Two of these candidates, Sunitinib and Crizotinib, demonstrated an inhibition potency (IC50) and binding affinity (Kd) in the nanomolar to micromolar range. While Sunitinib has already been known to inhibit LRRK2, Crizotinib is a novel LRRK2 binder. Our results underscore the potential of structure-based methods for drug discovery and development. In light of the recent breakthroughs in cryo-electron microscopy and structure prediction, we believe that structure-based approaches like ours will grow in importance.<sep>Many drugs are promiscuous and bind to multiple targets. On the one hand, these targets may be linked to unwanted side effects, but on the other, they may achieve a combined desired effect (polypharmacology) or represent multiple diseases (drug repositioning). With the growth of 3D structures of drug-target complexes, it is today possible to study drug promiscuity at the structural level and to screen vast amounts of drug-target interactions to predict side effects, polypharmacological potential, and repositioning opportunities. Here, we pursue such an approach to identify drugs inactivating B-cells, whose dysregulation can function as a driver of autoimmune diseases. Screening over 500 kinases, we identified 22 candidate targets, whose knock out impeded the activation of B-cells. Among these 22 is the gene KDR, whose gene product VEGFR2 is a prominent cancer target with anti-VEGFR2 drugs on the market for over a decade. The main result of this paper is that structure-based drug repositioning for the identified kinase targets identified the cancer drug ibrutinib as micromolar VEGFR2 inhibitor with a very high therapeutic index in B-cell inactivation. These findings prove that ibrutinib is not only acting on the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase BTK, against which it was designed. Instead, it may be a polypharmacological drug, which additionally targets angiogenesis via inhibition of VEGFR2. Therefore ibrutinib carries potential to treat other VEGFR2 associated disease. Structure-based drug repositioning explains ibrutinib’s anti VEGFR2 action through the conservation of a specific pattern of interactions of the drug with BTK and VEGFR2. Overall, structure-based drug repositioning was able to predict these findings at a fraction of the time and cost of a conventional screen.</abstract>", "<keyword>DU145<sep>Repertoire<sep>Disease<sep>Epitope<sep>LNCaP<sep>CD19<sep>Nucleolin<sep>Cancer<sep>Prostate cancer<sep>breakpoint cluster region<sep>Humoral immunity<sep>Plasmodium (life cycle)<sep>Antibody<sep>Immune system<sep>Antigen<sep>Plasmodium falciparum<sep>Function (biology)<sep>Malaria<sep>Somatic hypermutation<sep>B cell<sep>Immunoglobulin M<sep>Immunity<sep>Memory B cell</keyword><title>B Cell Receptor Repertoire Analysis in Malaria-Naive and Malaria-Experienced Individuals Reveals Unique Characteristics of Atypical Memory B Cells<sep>Potential functions of atypical memory B cells in Plasmodium-exposed individuals<sep>Naturally Acquired Humoral Immunity Against Plasmodium falciparum Malaria<sep>NCL Inhibition Exerts Antineoplastic Effects against Prostate Cancer Cells by Modulating Oncogenic MicroRNAs<sep>The origin and fate of malaria-associated atypical memory B cells<sep>A comparative analysis of memory B cell and antibody responses against <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> merozoite surface protein 1 in children and adults from Uganda<sep>Longitudinal analysis of FcRL5 expression and clonal relationships among classical and atypical memory B cells following malaria<sep>A Molecular Analysis of Memory B Cell and Antibody Responses Against Plasmodium falciparum Merozoite Surface Protein 1 in Children and Adults From Uganda</title><abstract>Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, still contributes to a high global burden of disease, mainly in children under 5 years of age. Chronic and recurrent Plasmodium infections affect the development of B cell memory against the parasite and promote the accumulation of atypical memory B cells (atMBCs), which have an unclear function in the immune response.<sep>Naturally acquired iummunity against clinical malaria is slow to develop, taking years of repeated exposure to parasites to acquire sufficiently broad and potent antibody responses. Increasing evidence suggests that Plasmodium infection and the resulting immune stimulation contribute to changes in the B cell compartment. In particular, accumulation of atypical memory B cells (atMBCs) is common in Plasmodium-exposed individuals. Similarities to B cell subsets present in other acute and chronic disease settings have provided insight into the development and potential function of these cells; however, their contribution to protection against malaria is still poorly understood. Here, we discuss recent findings that have increased our understanding of atMBCs and outline outstanding questions related to their function and development in the protective immune response to malaria.<sep>Malaria remains a significant contributor to the global burden of disease, with around 40% of the world's population at risk of Plasmodium infections. The development of an effective vaccine against the malaria parasite would mark a breakthrough in the fight to eradicate the disease. Over time, natural infection elicits a robust immune response against the blood stage of the parasite, providing protection against malaria. In recent years, we have gained valuable insight into the mechanisms by which IgG acts to prevent pathology and inhibit parasite replication, as well as the potential role of immunoglobulin M (IgM) in these processes. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms, acquisition, and maintenance of naturally acquired immunity, and the relevance of these discoveries for the development of a potential vaccine against the blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum.<sep>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is only temporarily effective for advanced-stage PCa, as the disease inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The protein nucleolin (NCL) is overexpressed in several types of human tumors where it is also mislocalized to the cell surface. We previously reported the identification of a single-chain fragment variable (scFv) immuno-agent that is able to bind NCL on the surface of breast cancer cells and inhibit proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated whether NCL could be a valid therapeutic target for PCa, utilizing DU145, PC3 (CRPC), and LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) cell lines. First, we interrogated the publicly available databases and noted that higher NCL mRNA levels are associated with higher Gleason Scores as well as with recurrent and metastatic tumors. Then, using our anti-NCL scFv, we demonstrated that NCL is expressed on the surface of all three tested cell lines and that NCL inhibition results in reduced proliferation and migration. We also measured the inhibitory effect of NCL targeting on the biogenesis of oncogenic microRNAs such as miR-21, -221 and -222, which was cell context dependent. Taken together, our data provide evidence that NCL targeting inhibits the key hallmarks of malignancy in PCa cells and may provide a novel therapeutic option for patients with advanced-stage PCa.<sep>Abstract Chronic and frequently recurring infectious diseases, such as malaria, are commonly associated with expanded populations of atypical memory B cells (atMBCs, here defined as CD19+CD20+CD21−CD27− B cells). While the phenotype and conditions leading to the generation of atMBCs in malaria-experienced individuals have extensively been studied, the origin and fate of these cells remain largely elusive. Using B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing to track clonally related cells present before and after a malaria episode in 5-year-old Ugandan children, we observed that IgM+ atMBCs were predominantly derived from naïve B cells, while IgG+ atMBCs present after a malaria episode mainly originated from FcRL5+IgG+ classical MBCs (cMBCs, CD19+CD20+CD21+CD27+ B cells). IgM+ atMBCs showed fewer connections with other B cell subsets and higher turnover than IgG+ atMBCs. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed that IgG+ atMBCs could be divided into two distinct clusters, one of which was maintained up to 6 months after infection. These results underscore the heterogeneity among atMBCs and highlight differences in their longevity. Finally, we observed that atMBCs from malaria-naïve and malaria-experienced donors showed many similarities in BCR characteristics, such as levels of somatic hypermutation, suggesting that atMBCs undergo similar differentiation pathways in response to different types of pathogens. In terms of BCR characteristics, IgM+ atMBCs of all donors closely resembled NBCs, while IgG+ atMBCs were more similar to IgG+ cMBCs. Collectively, our results highlight differences between unswitched and switched atMBC populations and shed light on the origin and fate of atMBCs in malaria-experienced individuals.<sep>Abstract Memory B cells (MBCs) and plasma antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens are important components of the protective immune response against malaria. To gain understanding of how responses against P. falciparum develop in these two arms of the humoral immune system, we evaluated MBC and antibody responses against the most abundant merozoite antigen, merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), in individuals from a region in Uganda with high P. falciparum transmission. Our results showed that MSP1-specific B cells in adults with immunological protection against malaria were predominantly IgG + classical MBCs, while children with incomplete protection mainly harbored IgM + MSP1-specific classical MBCs. In contrast, anti-MSP1 plasma IgM reactivity was minimal in both children and adults. Instead, both groups showed high plasma IgG reactivity against MSP1 and whole merozoites, with broadening of the response against non-3D7 strains in adults. The antibodies encoded by MSP1-specific IgG + MBCs carried high levels of amino acid substitutions and recognized relatively conserved epitopes on the highly variable MSP1 protein. Proteomics analysis of MSP1 19 -specific IgG in plasma of an adult revealed a limited repertoire of anti-MSP1 antibodies, most of which were IgG 1 or IgG 3 . Similar to MSP1- specific MBCs, anti-MSP1 IgGs had relatively high levels of amino acid substitutions and their sequences were predominantly found in classical MBCs, not atypical MBCs. Collectively, these results showed evolution of the MSP1-specific humoral immune response with cumulative P. falciparum exposure, with a shift from IgM + to IgG + B cell memory, diversification of B cells from germline, and stronger recognition of MSP1 variants by the plasma IgG repertoire.<sep>Chronic and frequently recurring infectious diseases, such as malaria, are associated with expanded populations of atypical memory B cells (MBCs). These cells are different from classical MBCs by the lack of surface markers CD21 and CD27 and increased expression of inhibitory receptors, such as FcRL5. While the phenotype and conditions leading to neogenesis of atypical MBCs in malaria-experienced individuals have been studied extensively, the origin of these cells remains equivocal. Functional similarities between FcRL5+ atypical MBCs and FcRL5+ classical MBCs have been reported, suggesting that these cells may be developmentally related.Here, a longitudinal analysis of FcRL5 expression in various B cell subsets was performed in two children from a high transmission region in Uganda over a 6-month period in which both children experienced a malaria episode. Using B-cell receptor (BCR)-sequencing to track clonally related cells, the connections between IgM+ and IgG+ atypical MBCs and other B cell subsets were studied.The highest expression of FcRL5 was found among IgG+ atypical MBCs, but FcRL5+ cells were present in all MBC subsets. Following malaria, FcRL5 expression increased in all IgM+ MBC subsets analysed here: classical, activated, and atypical MBCs, while results for IgG+ MBC subsets were inconclusive. IgM+ atypical MBCs showed few connections with other B cell subsets, higher turnover than IgG+ atypical MBCs, and were predominantly derived from naïve B cells and FcRL5- IgM+ classical MBCs. In contrast, IgG+ atypical MBCs were clonally expanded and connected with classical MBCs. IgG+ atypical MBCs present after a malaria episode mainly originated from FcRL5+ IgG+ classical MBCs.Collectively, these results suggest fundamental differences between unswitched and class-switched B cell populations and provide clues about the primary developmental pathways of atypical MBCs in malaria-experienced individuals.<sep>Memory B cells (MBCs) and plasma antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) merozoite antigens are important components of the protective immune response against malaria. To gain understanding of how responses against Pf develop in these two arms of the humoral immune system, we evaluated MBC and antibody responses against the most abundant merozoite antigen, full-length Pf merozoite surface protein 1 (PfMSP1 FL ), in individuals from a region in Uganda with high Pf transmission. Our results showed that PfMSP1 FL -specific B cells in adults with immunological protection against malaria were predominantly IgG + classical MBCs, while children with incomplete protection mainly harbored IgM + PfMSP1 FL -specific classical MBCs. In contrast, anti-PfMSP1 FL plasma IgM reactivity was minimal in both children and adults. Instead, both groups showed high plasma IgG reactivity against PfMSP1 FL , with broadening of the response against non-3D7 strains in adults. The B cell receptors encoded by PfMSP1 FL -specific IgG + MBCs carried high levels of amino acid substitutions and recognized relatively conserved epitopes on the highly variable PfMSP1 protein. Proteomics analysis of PfMSP1 19 -specific IgG in plasma of an adult revealed a limited repertoire of anti-MSP1 antibodies, most of which were IgG 1 or IgG 3 . Similar to B cell receptors of PfMSP1 FL -specific MBCs, anti-PfMSP1 19 IgGs had high levels of amino acid substitutions and their sequences were predominantly found in classical MBCs, not atypical MBCs. Collectively, these results showed evolution of the PfMSP1-specific humoral immune response with cumulative Pf exposure, with a shift from IgM + to IgG + B cell memory, diversification of B cells from germline, and stronger recognition of PfMSP1 variants by the plasma IgG repertoire.</abstract>", "<keyword>Trimer<sep>Carbon footprint<sep>Ultrashort pulse<sep>Exciton<sep>Mesoscopic physics<sep>Sustainable development<sep>Annihilation<sep>Molecular dynamics<sep>Sustainability<sep>Cyanine<sep>Greenhouse gas<sep>Delocalized electron<sep>Order (exchange)<sep>Biexciton<sep>Corporate governance</keyword><title>Ultrafast bi-excitonic dynamics and annihilation in molecular and mesoscopic systems<sep>Simulating exciton migration and annihilation dynamics in higher order spectroscopies of a molecular trimer<sep>Exciton-Exciton Annihilation as a Mechanism for Uphill Transfer in a Molecular Excitonic System<sep>Sustainability Budgets: A Practical Management and Governance Method for Achieving Goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals for AI Development</title><abstract>We present 5 th and 3 rd order 2D spectra of a squarine trimer.

Both measurements are consistent with an exciton delocalization length of ~28 monomers. A model assuming diffusive exciton motion reveals that the exciton mobility is at least bimodal and restricted to one spatial dimension. J-band diffusion rates of 2.69 and 2.79e -3 cm 2 s -1 are found, leading to maximal diffusion lengths of 449 and 14.5 nm. The findings indicate that exciton-exciton annihilation is the origin of effective uphill transfer. This mechanism, if present under solar radiation, maybe useful for organic photovoltaic systems.<sep>Climate change is a global priority. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) outlined its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which stated that taking urgent action to tackle climate change and its impacts was a key priority. The 2021 World Climate Summit finished with calls for governments to take tougher measures towards reducing their carbon footprints. However, it is not obvious how governments can make practical implementations to achieve this goal. One challenge towards achieving a reduced carbon footprint is gaining awareness of how energy exhaustive a system or mechanism is. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to solve global problems, and its use could potentially solve challenges relating to climate change, but the creation of AI systems often requires vast amounts of, up front, computing power, and, thereby, it can be a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. If governments are to take the SDGs and calls to reduce carbon footprints seriously, they need to find a management and governance mechanism to (i) audit how much their AI system ‘costs’ in terms of energy consumption and (ii) incentivise individuals to act based upon the auditing outcomes, in order to avoid or justify politically controversial restrictions that may be seen as bypassing the creativity of developers. The idea is thus to find a practical solution that can be implemented in software design that incentivises and rewards and that respects the autonomy of developers and designers to come up with smart solutions. This paper proposes such a sustainability management mechanism by introducing the notion of ‘Sustainability Budgets’—akin to Privacy Budgets used in Differential Privacy—and by using these to introduce a ‘Game’ where participants are rewarded for designing systems that are ‘energy efficient’. Participants in this game are, among others, the Machine Learning developers themselves, which is a new focus for this problem that this text introduces. The paper later expands this notion to sustainability management in general and outlines how it might fit into a wider governance framework.</abstract>"]}

However, running a basic NMF analysis requires the installation of multiple tools and dependencies, along with a steep learning curve and computing time. To mitigate such obstacles, we developed ShinyButchR, a novel R/Shiny application that provides a complete NMF-based analysis workflow, allowing the user to perform matrix decomposition using NMF, feature extraction, interactive visualization, relevant signature identification, and association to biological and clinical variables. ShinyButchR builds upon the also novel R package ButchR, which provides new TensorFlow solvers for algorithms of the NMF family, functions for downstream analysis, a rational method to determine the optimal factorization rank and a novel feature selection strategy.<sep>Understanding the role of transcription and transcription factors in cellular identity and disease, such as cancer and autoimmunity, is essential. However, comprehensive data resources for cell line-specific transcription factor-to-target gene annotations are currently limited. To address this, we developed a straightforward method to define regulons that capture the cell-specific aspects of TF binding and transcript expression levels. By integrating cellular transcriptome and transcription factor binding data, we generated regulons for four common cell lines comprising both proximal and distal cell line-specific regulatory events. Through systematic benchmarking involving transcription factor knockout experiments, we demonstrated performance on par with state-of-the-art methods, with our method being easily applicable to other cell types of interest. We present case studies using three cancer single-cell datasets to showcase the utility of these cell-type-specific regulons in exploring transcriptional dysregulation. In summary, this study provides a valuable tool and a resource for systematically exploring cell line-specific transcriptional regulations, emphasizing the utility of network analysis in deciphering disease mechanisms.<sep>Background: Heart failure represents the end-stage of a range of diseases which adversely impact the heart muscle. The extent by which cellular and molecular mechanisms differ between myocardial diseases in heart failure remains incompletely understood. Methods: We performed isolation and droplet-based RNA-sequencing of 394 247 single nuclei from 103 explanted hearts from transplant and ventricular assist device recipients and 7 unused donor hearts without heart disease. After sample and nuclei level quality control, doublet removal and sample integration; principal component analysis and shared nearest neighbor clustering were used to identify distinct cell populations. Cell type composition and transcriptomic profiles were compared across donor hearts and 10 myocardial diseases (hypertrophic, dilated, ischemic, restrictive, arrythmogenic and non-compaction cardiomyopathy; rheumatic and congenital heart disease; cardiac amyloidosis and graft rejection; n=1-45/group). Results: We identified and manually annotated 14 distinct cell populations that were present across controls and myocardial diseases, including transcriptionally diverse subgroups of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes. Compared to controls, we observed disease-specific differences in cell populations with regards to composition, heterogeneity, and specific transcriptional profiles. Conclusions: Our results reveal differences in single cell profiles of individual heart muscle diseases compared to controls without heart disease.<sep>Splicing of genomic exons into mRNAs is a critical prerequisite for the accurate synthesis of human proteins. Genetic variants impacting splicing underlie a substantial proportion of genetic disease, but are challenging to identify beyond those occurring at donor and acceptor dinucleotides. To address this, various methods aim to predict variant effects on splicing. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achieve better results in predicting splice variants than other strategies.It has been unclear how best to integrate such process-specific scores into genome-wide variant effect predictors. Here, we use a recently published experimental data set to compare several machine learning methods that score variant effects on splicing. We integrate the best of those approaches into general variant effect prediction models and observe the effect on classification of known pathogenic variants.We integrate two specialized splicing scores into CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion; cadd.gs.washington.edu ), a widely used tool for genome-wide variant effect prediction that we previously developed to weight and integrate diverse collections of genomic annotations. With this new model, CADD-Splice, we show that inclusion of splicing DNN effect scores substantially improves predictions across multiple variant categories, without compromising overall performance.While splice effect scores show superior performance on splice variants, specialized predictors cannot compete with other variant scores in general variant interpretation, as the latter account for nonsense and missense effects that do not alter splicing. Although only shown here for splice scores, we believe that the applied approach will generalize to other specific molecular processes, providing a path for the further improvement of genome-wide variant effect prediction.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Symbiosis<sep>Juvenile<sep>Predation<sep>Mesocosm<sep>Marine invertebrates<sep>Microbiome<sep>Metagenomics<sep>Anthozoa<sep>Sea urchin<sep>Effects of global warming on oceans<sep>Foraminifera<sep>Symbiotic bacteria<sep>Environmental change<sep>Coral bleaching<sep>Coral reef<sep>Benthic zone<sep>Climate change<sep>Foraging<sep>Coral<sep>Obligate<sep>Sponge<sep>Ocean acidification<sep>Predator<sep>Holobiont</keyword><title>Ocean warming increases availability of crustacean prey via riskier behavior<sep>Microbes from Mum: symbiont transmission in the tropical reef sponge Ianthella basta<sep>A genomic view of the microbiome of coral reef demosponges<sep>Simulated future conditions of ocean warming and acidification disrupt the microbiome of the calcifying foraminifera <scp> <i>Marginopora vertebralis</i> </scp> across life stages<sep>Comparative genome-centric analysis reveals seasonal variation in the function of coral reef microbiomes<sep>Life‐stage specificity and cross‐generational climate effects on the microbiome of a tropical sea urchin (Echinodermata: Echinoidea)<sep>The promotion of stress tolerant Symbiodiniaceae dominance in juveniles of two coral species under simulated future conditions of ocean warming and acidification<sep>The promotion of stress tolerant Symbiodiniaceae dominance in juveniles of two coral species due to simulated future conditions of ocean warming and acidification</title><abstract>Abstract Marine prey and predators will respond to future climate through physiological and behavioral adjustments. However, our understanding of how such direct effects may shift the outcome of predator–prey interactions is still limited. Here, we investigate the effects of ocean warming and acidification on foraging behavior and biomass of a common prey (shrimps, Palaemon spp.) tested in large mesocosms harboring natural resources and habitats. Acidification did not alter foraging behavior in prey. Under warming, however, prey showed riskier behavior by foraging more actively and for longer time periods, even in the presence of a live predator. No effects of longer-term exposure to climate stressors were detected on prey biomass. Our findings suggest that ocean warming may increase the availability of some prey to predators via a behavioral pathway (i.e., increased risk-taking by prey), likely by elevating metabolic demand of prey species.<sep>Most marine sponge species harbour distinct communities of microorganisms which contribute to various aspects of their host's health and physiology. In addition to their key roles in nutrient transformations and chemical defence, these symbiotic microbes can shape sponge phenotype by mediating important developmental stages and influencing the environmental tolerance of the host. However, the characterisation of each microbial taxon throughout a sponge's life cycle remains challenging, with several sponge species hosting up to 3000 distinct microbial species. Ianthella basta, an abundant broadcast spawning species in the Indo-Pacific, is an emerging model for sponge symbiosis research as it harbours only three dominant symbionts: a Thaumarchaeotum, a Gammaproteobacterium, and an Alphaproteobacterium. Here, we successfully spawned Ianthella basta, characterised its mode of reproduction, and used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and transmission electron microscopy to characterise the microbial community throughout its life cycle. We confirmed I. basta as being gonochoric and showed that the three dominant symbionts, which together make up >90% of the microbiome according to 16S rRNA gene abundance, are vertically transmitted from mother to offspring by a unique method involving encapsulation in the peri-oocytic space, suggesting an obligate relationship between these microbes and their host.<sep>Abstract Sponges underpin the productivity of coral reefs, yet few of their microbial symbionts have been functionally characterised. Here we present an analysis of ~1200 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) spanning seven sponge species and 25 microbial phyla. Compared to MAGs derived from reef seawater, sponge-associated MAGs were enriched in glycosyl hydrolases targeting components of sponge tissue, coral mucus and macroalgae, revealing a critical role for sponge symbionts in cycling reef organic matter. Further, visualisation of the distribution of these genes amongst symbiont taxa uncovered functional guilds for reef organic matter degradation. Genes for the utilisation of sialic acids and glycosaminoglycans present in sponge tissue were found in specific microbial lineages that also encoded genes for attachment to sponge-derived fibronectins and cadherins, suggesting these lineages can utilise specific structural elements of sponge tissue. Further, genes encoding CRISPR and restriction-modification systems used in defence against mobile genetic elements were enriched in sponge symbionts, along with eukaryote-like gene motifs thought to be involved in maintaining host association. Finally, we provide evidence that many of these sponge-enriched genes are laterally transferred between microbial taxa, suggesting they confer a selective advantage within the sponge niche and therefore play a critical role in host ecology and evolution.<sep>Summary Foraminifera host diverse microbial communities that can shift in response to changing environmental conditions. To characterize climate change impacts on the foraminifera microbiome across life stages, we exposed adult Marginopora vertebralis (Large Benthic Foraminifera) to p CO 2 and temperature scenarios representing present‐day, 2050 and 2100 levels and raised juveniles under present‐day and 2050 conditions. While treatment condition had no significant effect on the seawater microbial communities, exposure to future scenarios significantly altered both adult and juvenile microbiomes. In adults, divergence between present‐day and 2050 or 2100 conditions was primarily driven by a reduced relative abundance of Oxyphotobacteria under elevated temperature and p CO 2 . In juveniles, the microbial shift predominantly resulted from changes in the proportion of Proteobacteria. Indicator species analysis identified numerous treatment‐specific indicator taxa, most of which were indicative of present‐day conditions. Oxyphotobacteria, previously reported as putative symbionts of foraminifera, were indicative of present‐day and 2050 conditions in adults, but of present‐day conditions only in juveniles. Overall, we show that the sensitivity of the M. vertebralis microbiome to climate change scenarios extends to both life stages and primarily correlates with declines in Oxyphotobacteria and shifts in Proteobacteria under elevated temperature and p CO 2 .<sep>Abstract Microbially mediated processes contribute to coral reef resilience yet, despite extensive characterisation of microbial community variation following environmental perturbation, the effect on microbiome function is poorly understood. We undertook metagenomic sequencing of sponge, macroalgae and seawater microbiomes from a macroalgae-dominated inshore coral reef to define their functional potential and evaluate seasonal shifts in microbially mediated processes. In total, 125 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes were reconstructed, spanning 15 bacterial and 3 archaeal phyla. Multivariate analysis of the genomes relative abundance revealed changes in the functional potential of reef microbiomes in relation to seasonal environmental fluctuations (e.g. macroalgae biomass, temperature). For example, a shift from Alphaproteobacteria to Bacteroidota-dominated seawater microbiomes occurred during summer, resulting in an increased genomic potential to degrade macroalgal-derived polysaccharides. An 85% reduction of Chloroflexota was observed in the sponge microbiome during summer, with potential consequences for nutrition, waste product removal, and detoxification in the sponge holobiont. A shift in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidota ratio was detected on macroalgae over summer with potential implications for polysaccharide degradation in macroalgal microbiomes. These results highlight that seasonal shifts in the dominant microbial taxa alter the functional repertoire of host-associated and seawater microbiomes, and highlight how environmental perturbation can affect microbially mediated processes in coral reef ecosystems.<sep>Microbes play a critical role in the development and health of marine invertebrates, though microbial dynamics across life stages and host generations remain poorly understood in most reef species, especially in the context of climate change. Here, we use a 4-year multigenerational experiment to explore microbe-host interactions under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-forecast climate scenarios in the rock-boring tropical urchin Echinometra sp. A. Adult urchins (F0 ) were exposed for 18 months to increased temperature and pCO2 levels predicted for years 2050 and 2100 under RCP 8.5, a period which encompassed spawning. After rearing F1 offspring for a further 2 years, spawning was induced, and F2 larvae were raised under current day and 2100 conditions. Cross-generational climate effects were also explored in the microbiome of F1 offspring through a transplant experiment. Using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we determined that each life stage and generation was associated with a distinct microbiome, with higher microbial diversity observed in juveniles compared to larval stages. Although life-stage specificity was conserved under climate conditions projected for 2050 and 2100, we observed changes in the urchin microbial community structure within life stages. Furthermore, we detected a climate-mediated parental effect when juveniles were transplanted among climate treatments, with the parental climate treatment influencing the offspring microbiome. Our findings reveal a potential for cross-generational impacts of climate change on the microbiome of a tropical invertebrate species.<sep>The symbiotic relationship between coral and its endosymbiotic algae, Symbiodiniaceae, greatly influences the hosts’ potential to withstand environmental stress. To date, the effects of climate change on this relationship has primarily focused on adult corals. Uncovering the effects of environmental stress on the establishment and development of this symbiosis in early life stages is critical for predicting how corals may respond to climate change. To determine the impacts of future climate projections on the establishment of symbionts in juvenile corals, ITS2 amplicon sequencing of single coral juveniles was applied to Goniastrea retiformis and Acropora millepora before and after exposure to three climate conditions of varying temperature and p CO 2 levels (current and RCP8.5 in 2050 and 2100). Compared to ambient conditions, juvenile corals experienced shuffling in the relative abundance of Cladocopium (C1m, decrease) to Durusdinium (D1 and D1a, increase) over time. We calculated a novel risk metric incorporating functional redundancy and likelihood of impact on host physiology to identify the loss of D1a as a “low risk” to the coral compared to the loss of “higher risk” taxa like D1 and C1m. Although the increase in stress tolerant Durusdinium under future warming was encouraging for A. millepora , by 2100, G. retiformis communities displayed signs of symbiosis de-regulation, suggesting this acclimatory mechanism may have species-specific thresholds. Whilst this study cannot specifically disentangle the individual effects of temperature and p CO 2 , it does provide valuable insights into the impacts of both stressors combined. These results emphasize the need for understanding of long-term effects of climate change induced stress on coral juveniles, and their potential for increased acclimation to heat tolerance through changes in symbiosis.<sep>Summary The symbiotic relationship between coral and its endosymbiotic algae, Symbiodiniaceae, greatly influences the hosts’ potential to withstand environmental stress.

Originality Statement Here we assessed changes in the uptake and establishment of Symbiodiniaceae in the early lifehistory stages of two coral species under future climate scenarios. Our study represents the first such assessment of future climate change projections (increased temperature and p CO 2 ) influencing Symbiodiniaceae acquisition and specifically shows a community structure dominated by the stress tolerant genus Durusdinium . We also develop a novel risk metric that includes taxonomic function and redundancy to estimate the impact of symbiont taxa changes on coral physiology.

We identified six melanoma lines harboring BRAF fusions representative of the clinical cases reported in the literature. Their unexpected heterogeneous responses to RAF and MEK inhibitors could be categorized upon specific features of the fusion kinases. Higher expression level correlated with resistance, and fusion partners containing a dimerization domain promoted paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hyperproliferation in response to first- and second-generation RAF inhibitors. By contrast, next-generation αC-IN/DFG-OUT RAF inhibitors blunted paradoxical activation across all lines and had their therapeutic efficacy further increased in vitro and in vivo by combination with MEK inhibitors, opening perspectives in the clinical management of tumors harboring BRAF fusions.</abstract>", "<keyword>Buckingham<sep>Haematopoiesis<sep>Stem cell<sep>Miniature swine<sep>Platelet<sep>Chimera (genetics)<sep>Immunosuppression<sep>Perfusion<sep>Antibody<sep>Bone marrow<sep>Adipose tissue<sep>Xenotransplantation</keyword><title>Adipose Stem Cells Promote Composite Tissue Engraftment<sep>Vascularized Bone Marrow Cellular Depletion or Discontinuity Abrogates Protection of Vascularized Composite Allografts in Nonhuman Primates<sep>Knock‐out of N‐glycolylneuraminic acid attenuates antibody‐mediated rejection in xenogenically perfused porcine lungs</title><abstract>Shockcor, Nicole M.

MD, FACS Author Information<sep>Vascularized composite allografts (VCA) have demonstrated good clinical outcomes dependent on chronic immunosuppression. Previous work by our group and others supports that cotransplanted vascularized bone marrow (VBM) as a component of VCA offers immunologic protection to prolong graft survival. We aimed to characterize the requirements and potential mechanisms of VBM-mediated protection of VCA by modifying grafts through various strategies.Experimental groups of mismatched cynomolgus macaque recipients received VCA transplants modified by the following approaches: heterotopic separation of the VCA and VBM components; T-cell depletion of either donor or recipient; irradiation of donor VCA; and infusion of donor bone marrow. All groups received standard immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.Experimental modifications to donor, recipient, or graft all demonstrated short-graft survivals (31 d). Chimerism levels without bone marrow infusion were transient and minimal when detected and were not associated with prolonged survival. Donor bone marrow infusion increased levels of chimerism but resulted in alloantibody production and did not improve graft survival.VCA graft survival is significantly reduced compared with previously reported VCA with VBM transplants (348 d; P = 0.01) when the hematopoietic niche is removed, altered, or destroyed via irradiation, depletion, or topographical rearrangement. These experimental manipulations resulted in similar outcomes to VCA grafts without cotransplanted VBM (25 d). These data support the presence of a radiosensitive, T-cell population within the VBM compartment not reconstituted by reinfusion of bone marrow cells.<sep>Antibody-mediated rejection has long been known to be one of the major organ failure mechanisms in xenotransplantation. In addition to the porcine α1,3-galactose (α1,3Gal) epitope, N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a sialic acid, has been identified as an important porcine antigen against which most humans have pre-formed antibodies. Here we evaluate GalTKO.hCD46 lungs with an additional cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene knock-out (Neu5GcKO) in a xenogeneic ex vivo perfusion model METHODS: Eleven GalTKO.hCD46.Neu5GcKO pig lungs were perfused for up to 6 h with fresh heparinized human blood. Six of them were treated with histamine (H) blocker famotidine and 1-thromboxane synthase inhibitor Benzylimidazole (BIA) and five were left untreated. GalTKO.hCD46 lungs without Neu5GcKO (n = 18: eight untreated and 10 BIA+H treated) served as a reference. Functional parameters, blood, and tissue samples were collected at pre-defined time points throughout the perfusion RESULTS: All but one Neu5GcKO organs maintained adequate blood oxygenation and \"survived\" until elective termination at 6 h whereas two reference lungs failed before elective termination at 4 h. Human anti-Neu5Gc antibody serum levels decreased during the perfusion of GalTKO.hCD46 lungs by flow cytometry (∼40% IgM, 60% IgG), whereas antibody levels in Neu5GcKO lung perfusions did not fall (IgM p = .007; IgG p < .001). Thromboxane elaboration, thrombin generation, and histamine levels were significantly reduced with Neu5GcKO lungs compared to reference in the untreated groups (p = .007, .005, and .037, respectively); treatment with BIA+H masked these changes. Activation of platelets, measured as CD62P expression on circulating platelets, was lower in Neu5GcKO experiments compared to reference lungs (p = .023), whereas complement activation (as C3a rise in plasma) was not altered. MCP-1 and lactotransferin level elevations were blunted in Neu5GcKO lung perfusions (p = .007 and .032, respectively). Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) rise was significantly attenuated and delayed in untreated GalTKO.hCD46.Neu5GcKO lungs in comparison to the untreated GalTKO.hCD46 lungs (p = .003) CONCLUSION: Additional Neu5GcKO in GalTKO.hCD46 lungs significantly reduces parameters associated with antibody-mediated inflammation and activation of the coagulation cascade. Knock-out of the Neu5Gc sialic acid should be beneficial to reduce innate immune antigenicity of porcine lungs in future human recipients.</abstract>", "<keyword>Shock response spectrum<sep>Wavelet transform<sep>Wavelet<sep>Spacecraft<sep>Limiting<sep>Energy (signal processing)<sep>Accelerometer<sep>Shock wave<sep>Modal<sep>Space environment<sep>Attenuation<sep>Compression (physics)<sep>Random vibration<sep>Shock (circulatory)<sep>Vibration<sep>Test (biology)<sep>Bulkhead (partition)<sep>Component (thermodynamics)<sep>Shaker<sep>SIGNAL (programming language)</keyword><title>Optimization of Fatigue Test Signal Compression Using the Wavelet Transform (Final Report)<sep>Response Limiting in Shaker Shocks<sep>Modeling Pyroshock Attenuation in Space Structures<sep>Perspectives on Pyroshock Attenuation in Cylindrical Space Structures with a Bulkhead<sep>Multi-Axis Resonant Plate Shock Testing Evaluation and Test Specification Development<sep>Multi-Degrees-of-Freedom Energy Analysis for Identification of Failure Risk in Structural Components Subjected to Random Vibration and Shock Loading</title><abstract>This report summarizes Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) contribution to ATA Engineering, Inc's (ATA) project for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), entitled \"Optimization of Fatigue Test Signal Compression Using the Wavelet Transform.\" Sandia National Laboratories were a subcontractor to ATA. We were involved because this was a Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project that required ATA to partner with a national laboratory or academic institution. ATA selected SNL, and specifically the Environments Engineering Department (1557) because ATA has a long-standing working relationship with this department and the department staff have experience in environment definition, signal processing, fatigue testing protocols and traditional methods of generating inputs for accelerated fatigue testing.<sep>The primary goal of any laboratory test is to expose the unit-under-test to conservative realistic representations of a field environment. Satisfying this objective is not always straightforward due to laboratory equipment constraints. For vibration and shock tests performed on shakers over-testing and unrealistic failures can result because the control is a base acceleration and mechanical shakers have nearly infinite impedance. Force limiting and response limiting are relatively standard practices to reduce over-test risks in random-vibration testing. Shaker controller software generally has response limiting as a built-in capability and it is done without much user intervention since vibration control is a closed loop process. Limiting in shaker shocks is done for the same reasons, but because the duration of a shock is only a few milliseconds, limiting is a pre-planned user in the loop process. Shaker shock response limiting has been used for at least 30 years at Sandia National Laboratories, but it seems to be little known or used in industry. This objective of this paper is to re-introduce response limiting for shaker shocks to the aerospace community. The process is demonstrated on the BARBECUE testbed.<sep>Pyroshock events from the actuation of separation devices in satellites and launch vehicles are potentially damaging, very short, high intensity events with high frequency content. The pyroshock damage risk is mitigated somewhat by the fact that the shock intensity is attenuated by the spacecraft structure. The NASA and MIL standards, developed from extensive tests performed in the 1960’s, provide pyroshock attenuation guidelines for various structures common to spacecraft and launch vehicles. In this paper, we present the results from a numerical investigation of pyroshock attenuation in cylindrical shell structures. Pyroshock events were modeled using Sandia National Laboratories’ engineering mechanics simulation codes, specifically Sierra/SD. Upon verifying the numerical simulation results against a NASA-HDBK-7005 curve, various structural features were added and design variables were varied to investigate their effects on pyroshock wave propagation and attenuation. The results showed that current numerical simulation tools, given appropriate tuning parameters, are capable of modeling pyroshock events in a simple cylindrical geometry at a reasonable cost. The numerical simulations showed that the presence of geometric features had greater attenuating effects than previously understood. However, shock attenuation levels were less sensitive to design variables of the structural features than expected.<sep>Satellites and launch vehicles are subject to pyroshock events that come from the actuation of separation devices. The shocks are high frequency transients that decay quickly—within 5-20 ms—and can be damaging events for satellites and their components. The damage risk can be reduced by good design practice, taking advantage of the attenuating properties of structural features in the load path. NASA and MIL handbooks provide general guidelines for estimating the attenuating effects of distance, joints, and other structural features in the load path between the shock source and the shock sensitive component. One of the challenges is adequately modeling the dissipative mechanisms in structural features to better understand the risk to shock sensitive components. Previously, we examined the modeling of pyroshock attenuation in a cylindrical structure and used peak acceleration to evaluate how much shocks are attenuated by distance and structural features in a cylindrical structure. In this work, we investigated different quantities to gain more insight into how and why pyroshocks get attenuated by a bulkhead. We found that the bulkhead affects the SRS peak more than the SRS ramp and that approximately 30% of the structural intensity of the pyroshock flows into the bulkhead regardless of the thickness.<sep>Resonant plate testing is a shock test method that is frequently used to simulate pyroshock events in the laboratory. Recently, it was discovered that if the unit under test is installed at an off-center location, a tri-axial accelerometer would record a shock response in three directions and the resulting shock response spectra implied that the test may have qualified the component in three directions simultaneously. The purpose of this research project was to evaluate this idea of multi-axis shock testing to determine if it was truly a multi-axis shock environment and if such a test could be used as an equivalent component qualification test. A study was conducted using generic, additively manufactured components tested on a resonant plate, along with an investigation of plate motion to evaluate the component response to off- center plate excitation. The data obtained here along with the analytical simulations performed indicate that off-center resonant plate tests are actually not three-axis shock tests, but rather single axis shocks at an arbitrary angle dictated by the location of the unit under test on the plate. This conclusion is supported by the fact that only one vectored shock input is provided to the component in a resonant plate test. Thus, the output response is a coupled response of the transverse plate vibration and the rotational motion of the component on the plate. Additionally, a multi-axis shock test defined by three single axis test environments always results in a significant component over-test in one direction.<sep>Abstract When designing or analyzing a mechanical system, energy quantities provide insight into the severity of shock and vibration environments; however, the energy methods in the literature do not address localized behavior because energy quantities are usually computed for an entire structure. The main objective of this paper is to show how to compute the energy in the components of a mechanical system. The motivation for this work is that most systems fail functionally due to component failure, not because the primary structure was overloaded, and the ability to easily compute the spatial distribution of energy helps identify failure-sensitive components. The quantity of interest is input energy. That input energy can be decoupled modally is well known. What is less appreciated is that input energy can be computed at the component level exactly, using the component effective modal mass. We show that the steady-state input energy can be decomposed both spatially and modally and computed using input power spectra. A numerical example illustrates the spatial and modal decomposition of input energy and its utility in identifying components at risk of damage in random vibration and shock environments. We show that the modal properties of the structure and the spectral content of the input must be considered together to assess damage risk. Because input energy includes absorbed energy as well as relative kinetic energy and dissipated energy, it is the recommended energy quantity for assessing the severity of both random vibration and shock environments on a structure.</abstract>", "<keyword>Augmented reality<sep>Building information modeling<sep>Visual analytics<sep>Construction industry<sep>Field (mathematics)<sep>Factoring<sep>Ultimate tensile strength<sep>Thermal energy storage<sep>Deep learning<sep>HVAC<sep>Training (meteorology)<sep>Social network analysis<sep>Seismic loading<sep>Building model<sep>Haze<sep>Fictitious force<sep>Situated<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Beam (structure)<sep>Shock absorber<sep>Chilled water<sep>Earthquake shaking table<sep>Indoor air quality<sep>Acceleration<sep>Variance inflation factor<sep>Stiffness<sep>Compatibility (geochemistry)<sep>Lime<sep>Composite number<sep>Air conditioning<sep>Collinearity<sep>Incremental Dynamic Analysis<sep>Support vector machine<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>Tensile testing<sep>Task (project management)<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Displacement (psychology)<sep>Formative assessment<sep>Christian ministry<sep>Instructional simulation<sep>Finite element method<sep>Chiller<sep>Residual<sep>Cracking<sep>Academic achievement<sep>Test (biology)<sep>Fracture mechanics<sep>Component (thermodynamics)<sep>Peat<sep>Stakeholder<sep>Precast concrete<sep>Focus (optics)<sep>Slab<sep>Expansive clay<sep>Predictive maintenance<sep>Dissipation<sep>Compressive strength<sep>Majesty<sep>Flexural strength<sep>Chiller boiler system<sep>Energy consumption<sep>Supervised learning<sep>Virtual reality<sep>Deflection (physics)<sep>Multicollinearity<sep>Failure mode and effects analysis<sep>Three point flexural test<sep>Regression analysis<sep>Cluster analysis<sep>Building construction<sep>Facility management<sep>Cohesive zone model<sep>Linear regression<sep>Water content<sep>Low-rise<sep>Volume (thermodynamics)<sep>Scheduling (production processes)<sep>Tuned mass damper<sep>Fracture (geology)<sep>Vibration<sep>Damper</keyword><title>Prediction of Students' Academic Performance by K-Means Clustering<sep>Analyzing Post-Disaster Reconstruction Stakeholder Networks: Malaysian rural housing<sep>Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques for Predictive Maintenance in Cooler Condition<sep>BIM-VR Framework for Building Information Modelling in Engineering Education<sep>The potential of deep learning in dynamic maintenance scheduling for thermal energy storage chiller plants<sep>Efficient Thermal-Energy-Storage Chiller Plant Facility Management with Digital Twin-assisted Augmented Reality Application<sep>Adoption of Building Information Modelling in Malaysia medical facilities building construction<sep>Deploying a Deep Learning-based Application for an Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Air-Conditioning (TES-AC) System: Design Guidelines<sep>Pseudo dynamic loads energy dissipation in mechanical shock absorber seismic damper<sep>Fracture Energy Measurement in Different Concrete Grades<sep>A NONLINEAR FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF PRECAST INDUSTRIALISED BUILDING SYSTEM BEAM UNDER FLEXURAL TEST<sep>Application of deep learning in facility management and maintenance for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning<sep>FLEXURAL STRENGTH TEST OF PRECAST INDUSTRIALISED BUILDING SYSTEM BEAM-CORBEL CONNECTION<sep>Corrugated Structural Metal Decking System under Tensile Strength Test<sep>Dynamic response of scaled structure with one liquid tuned mass damper<sep>Effects of external weather on the water consumption of Thermal-Energy-Storage Air-Conditioning system<sep>Reliability Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Structure with Shock Absorber Damper under Pseudo-Dynamic Loads<sep>NONLINEAR DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF TWO STOREY RC BUILDING MODEL<sep>Charging water load prediction for a thermal-energy-storage air-conditioner of a commercial building with a multilayer perceptron<sep>Indoor haze particulate control using knowledge graphs within self-optimizing HVAC control systems<sep>Investigation on the engineering properties of peat soil stabilized using lime stabilisation and alkaline activation<sep>Non-linear dynamic assessment of low-rise RC building model under sequential ground motions<sep>Housing Price Prediction by Divided Regression Analysis<sep>Flexural strength test on new profiled composite slab system<sep>Personnel Training for Common Facility Management Issues in Thermal-Energy-Storage Chiller Plant using a Serious 3D Game<sep>Flexural performance of concrete composite metal decking with different base-metal-thickness new smart system</title><abstract>Schooling system must provide high quality learning opportunities to meet the educational needs and ensuring achievement for every student.

In this paper, k-means clustering method with deterministic model is used to analyze the student's overall performance. The results is important for educators to identify students who are at risk academically and areas where teaching strategies may need adjustment to better meet these students' needs.<sep>This article uses the social network analysis to identify resource coordination and information exchange of stakeholders in the inter-organizational network by studying the project-related interactions of rural housing reconstruction in Temerloh, Pahang that were funded by the Malaysian government, His Majesty the King and NGO. The data was collected through content analysis and interviews with 23 government agencies, NGOs, and community stakeholders. Findings from the analysis established that government agencies had the highest actor centralities, with the Rural Development Ministry and the local government level being the most central among the government agencies, whereas the homeowners had the lowest centralities.<sep>By exploiting the potential that machine learning has in predicting failures before they occur, a more robust maintenance plan can be planned, increasing operational efficiency, and saving expenses. Hence, utilizing machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance has become a primary focus in the field of facility management in the construction industry optimizing building efficiency with better decision-making. Nonetheless, to have an efficient system utilizing machine learning techniques, initially, an in-depth analysis of the common algorithms needs to be conducted to determine the efficacy of the available options. Therefore, this research focuses on analyzing common machine learning algorithms for supervised learning to predict cooler conditions for both classification and regression problems to determine the efficacy of the techniques.<sep>With the advancement of information technology, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is evolving fast and play an essential role in Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner and Operators (AECOO) industry. Universities play an important role in the current BIM transition in construction projects as well as to embrace Industry 4.0. In this research, immersive Virtual Reality (VR) in BIM offer a unique, supportive environment for the user experience in visualizing and collecting data from the model. With Virtual Reality (VR), engineering education has a major breakthrough. Immersive interactions, stereoscopic 3D, real time multisensory simulations, virtual explorations, synchronous communications, data analytics and visual analysis – all these are impossible without VR. VR offers a student-centred learning environment that promotes active and collaborative learning, situated within simulated real-world contexts.<sep>Deep learning is revolutionizing the construction industry with its ability to predict valuable information from big data. Thermal-energy-storage air-conditioners (TES-ACs) are currently being preferred compared to conventional air-conditioners due to their positive impact on the environment. However, maintaining them is a big challenge as TES-ACs contain many crucial components that need to be running smoothly at all times. By using deep learning models on different sensor data attached to different components of a TES-AC system, different predictions can be made. Component failures can be predicted ahead of time due to predictions derived from fluctuating sensor readings for example. This chapter discusses the potential of implementing various deep learning models on different sensors in a TES-AC system to predict component failures to create a dynamic maintenance scheduling that changes based on the predictions made.<sep>Abstract This study investigates the promising potential of integrating Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twin (DT) technologies within the context of Thermal-Energy-Storage (TES) chiller plants' facility management. The objective is to address the challenges posed by noise and discomfort, while also enhancing the efficiency of maintenance tasks. Drawing insights from a survey involving 17 facility management experts, the research unveils that 76.47% of respondents perceived the chiller plant environment as noisy, with 35.29% reporting discomfort. The outcomes reveal a clear inclination towards AR, preferred over Virtual Reality (VR) due to its accessibility and user-friendliness, requiring no additional equipment. Participants laud the remote accessibility and real-time updates facilitated by the AR application enriched with DT assistance. Nevertheless, the study underscores the importance of factoring in hardware limitations and device compatibility during the implementation of AR solutions. Overall, the outcomes affirm the viability and advantages of harnessing<sep>The Malaysia government acknowledged the importance of BIM technology for the medical facilities building, and the first pilot project that adopted BIM in Malaysia was the medical facilities building known as the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the 2010. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a new innovative technology for the construction industry stakeholders. BIM is a modelling technology and processes to communicate, produce and utilise the digital data information for the integration of the construction data and information throughout the project life cycle, with the purpose to enhance the efficiency, increase the productivity as well as enhance the collaboration among the project stakeholders. The government of Malaysia acknowledges the paramount importance of BIM technology for the transformation toward a more sustainable construction environment particularly in the construction of the medical facilities building construction. This study focused on the adoption of BIM technology in the construction<sep>Facility management and maintenance of the Thermal-Energy-Storage AirConditioning (TES-AC) system is a tedious task at a large scale mainly due to the charging load that can increase energy consumption if needed to be charged at peak hours. Besides, maintenance of TES-AC at a large scale gets complex as it contains many sensor data. By utilizing deep learning techniques on the sensor data, charging load prediction can be made possible, so facility managers can prepare in advance. However, a deep learning-based application will be unusable if it is not deployed in a userfriendly manner where facility managers can benefit from this application. Hence, this research focuses on gathering design guidelines for a deep learning-based application and further validates the design considerations with a developed application for efficient human-computer interaction through qualitative analysis. The approach taken to gather design guidelines demonstrated a positive correlation between expert-suggested features<sep>Earthquake tremor from neighbouring country had caused several cases of structural and non-structural damages toward the buildings in Malaysia. This issue had raised public attention about the safeness of the low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise building in the country. Buildings without proper seismic resistance design will collapse during the earth earthquake and people who could not evacuated from the building will be buried alive. Viscous Damper is one of the passive structural control systems in attenuating the seismic response on building. The damper utilized principle of fluid flow through orifices to create friction that turns the movement into heat energy to be release into atmosphere. This study is to investigate the effectiveness and behaviour of the mechanical shock absorber as damper in resisting seismic force. Three different type of dampers are being tested under 6 different loading displacement amplitude to measure the hysteresis loops and energy<sep>Fracture energy is regarded as an intrinsic (material) properties that dominates crack mechanisms and associated crack growth in concrete damage under applied stress. In recent times, significant advancements in computing technology have driven the adoption of finite element analysis (FEA) methodologies that necessitate the integration of constitutive models, includingthe traction-separation relationship derived from cutting-edge fracture mechanics. A physically-based model requires fracture energy values; therefore, a properly measured fracture energy value is essential to exhibit better structure response within FEA models. There are large arrays of parameters involved during the concrete mixture, such as beam size effect, aggregate size, and concrete grade, that affect the flexural resistance of the concrete. The fracture and failure in concrete ahead of the crack tip are represented by fracture energy values where micro-damage events such as interfacial failure, fiber-bridging, and matrix cracking occurred.This study aims to determinethe fracture energy of<sep>Software simulation enables design engineers to have a better picture of possible structural failure behaviour and determine the accuracy of a design before the actual structural component is fabricated. Finite element analysis is used to simulate the behaviour of the reinforced concrete beam under the flexural test. During the flexural test, results are recorded for both simulation and experimental tests. By comparing the results, beam displacement, crack patterns, and failure modes can be studied with better accuracy. The accuracy percentage for yield load and ultimate load between the two tests results were 94.12 % and 95.79 %, respectively, whereas the accuracy percentage for elastic gradient before the yielding stage was 81.08 %. The behaviour between simulation and laboratory models described is based on crack pattern and failure mode. The progression of von Mises (VM) stresses highlighted the critical areas of the reinforced concrete beam and<sep>Despite the promising results of deep learning research, construction industry applications are still limited. Facility Management (FM) in construction has yet to take full advantage of the efficiency of deep learning techniques in daily operations and maintenance. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major part of Facility Management and Maintenance (FMM) operations, and an occasional HVAC malfunction can lead to a huge monetary loss. The application of deep learning techniques in FMM can optimize building performance, especially in predictive maintenance, by lowering energy consumption, scheduling maintenance, as well as monitoring equipment. This review covers 100 papers that show how neural networks have evolved in this area and summarizes deep learning applications in facility management. Furthermore, it discusses the current challenges and foresees how deep learning applications can be useful in this field for researchers developing specific deep learning models for FMM. The paper<sep>Industrialised Building Systems (IBS) involves offsite fabrication in a systematic and controlled environment. The aim of this research is to determine the structural performance of newly enhanced column corbel support for IBS industry application. However, there is no solid data to support the industry in producing safe and reliable IBS structure with newly enhanced prototype. Hence, the objectives of this research paper are to identify failure behaviour, flexural strength, maximum deflection and ductility of the IBS beam to column corbel connection. Scaled 1:5 IBS beams with column supports were prepared according to Buckingham and Similitude Theorem. Result contribution of five specimens were obtained from the flexural strength test. The scaled beam has maximum flexural resistance of 2.2 kNm and deflection of 7 mm. The projected flexural resistance for full scale beam is 1265.6 kNm with ultimate load deflection of 35 mm. Failure behaviours such as<sep>Abstract Corrugated metal decking has been widely used in the construction industry for many years due to its benefits towards the sustainability, improve time performance of the projects and environmental aspects.

Novelty of this research is the discovery of the tensile performance of a cold rolled corrugated metal decking profiles at various points of interest for a composite flooring system. Tensile strength specimen preparation complies with the ASTM E8 Standard. A total of 60 specimens with different thicknesses and different parts of metal deck have been tested by the universal testing machine (UTM). The findings on how Base Metal Thickness (BMT) affects the tensile strength and the unique roll formed of the corrugated metal decking system, with 0.75BMT<sep>History shows that earthquakes from neighbouring countries cause great structural impacts on Malaysia. A tuned mass damper which is a damping system installed at a specific floor of a high-rise building could minimise the acceleration and dissipation of seismic energy from an earthquake. The case study is a high-rise structure scaled at 1:100, built based on an actual building’s tender drawings. The aim of this study is to investigate the dynamic response of scaled structures with one liquid tuned mass damper. There are three types of Tune Liquid Mass Damper (TLMD) being investigated in this research. TLMD of 0 g (TLMD-0), 337 g (TLMD-337) and 913 g (TLMD-913) of liquid were being installed individually on the roof service floor for dynamic load test. The findings show the scaled model with an increase in mass of TLMD caused the increase of roof top displacement by 15.56<sep>Thermal-Energy-Storage Air-Conditioning (TES-AC), a sustainable form of Air-Conditioning (AC) operates by storing thermal energy as chilled water when energy demand is low during nighttime. Later it uses the stored thermal energy during the daytime to cool the indoor air of the building the next day. However, the stored thermal energy in the form of water in the tanks of the chiller plant might be affected by external weather factors. It is essential to understand whether there is a relation between external weather conditions and water consumption in the TES-AC system. Without verifying the relation, applying computational intelligence for Thermal-Energy-Storage (TES) in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) would not be appropriate. However, not much research has focused on applying such techniques in HVAC for facility management and maintenance. Moreover, identifying these features by discovering the relation between weather and water consumption is a crucial part<sep>Past historical earthquake events from neighbouring countries have been proven to be disastrous. Building in the aftermath of an earthquake may reduce structural reliability, posing risk upon re-occupation of the building. Shock absorber viscous dampers were installed on a specific structure storey that could reduce the spectral acceleration and storey-drift caused by an earthquake. The research object is a low-rise, three-storey, reinforced concrete (RC) structure. This study aims to identify the dynamic response of the scaled RC structure with and without attached dampers and performs structural reliability of the tested model under the excitation of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) of 0.1 g to 1.0 g with a unidirectional shaking table. APIDO viscous dampers were installed parallel to the movement direction of the dynamic load test. The findings show the scaled model with attached viscous dampers reduces spectral acceleration and storey drift by 9.66% and 4.85%,<sep>Peninsular Malaysia lies in a low seismic zone, but its building structures had come across the concrete deterioration due to the seismic ground motion originated from far or near field. Notably, most of the building structures in this country are designed based on wind load only. Moreover, current practice to analyze or design a building such as FEMA 368 and EC8 underestimated the effect of repeated excitations. These guidelines only considered single vibrations to evaluate the framed structure. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the performance of private educational institute reinforced concrete building with generic 3D two storey frame structure under multiple seismic motions. Structural model was examined under series of earthquake motions which include pre-shock, main shock and aftershock scenario. Total of 7 seismic ground motions were selected to quantify the structural frame model by nonlinear dynamic time history analyses. Pseudo-dynamic<sep>This research focuses on the development of a machine learning model for predicting the water volume that needs to be chilled in Thermal-Energy-Storage-Air-Conditioning (TES-AC) systems. TES-AC technology uses thermal energy storage tanks to store and distribute chilled water during peak hours, reducing the need for the continuous operation of chillers and resulting in significant cost savings and a reduction in carbon emissions. However, determining the optimal amount of chilled water to generate and store each day can be challenging. The aim of this research is to design a machine learning model that takes input variables about the next day's weather, which day of the week it is, and occupancy data and outputs a predicted water volume that needs to be chilled. It utilizes a Multilayer Perceptron for charging water load prediction in TES-AC systems to assist facility managers in making informed decisions minimizing disruptions. By<sep>Abstract Transboundary haze pollution in South East Asia is posing a threat to conventional design of buildings yet indoor air pollution from haze particulate infiltration has still received less attention in Malaysia compared to haze pollution outdoors. Because of this minimal research effort, indoor building environments have increasingly become very complex environments for facility managers to monitor and control due to the corresponding growth in heterogeneity within building behavioural information and monitoring (sensory) systems. As a solution to this and part of an ongoing study, this paper presents the preliminary process of modelling heterogeneous building information related to indoor air quality (IAQ) (building envelope, sensors, contaminant properties, geometry, occupancy schedules and weather data) within modular and extensible semantic web knowledge graphs (KG). This work argues that this data model can preserve the existential and latent parametric relationships within such information therafter availing an accurate representation<sep>Peat soil is typically classified as a problematic soil due to its expansive behaviour that possesses geotechnical drawbacks. Thus, the condition of peat soil must be improved prior to any construction works. Stabilisation of peat soil can be done via chemical stabilisation and alkaline activation while incorporating industrial by-products or wastes as addictive. This study aims to investigate the effect of press mud as an additive in lime-stabilized and alkaline activator-stabilized peat soils. Press mud is a by-product of sugarcane juice filtering. The lime adopted is at 3 % and 5.5 % while the alkaline activator is used in cold and warm condition. A total of 5 percentages of press mud have been employed, namely 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%. The investigations revealed that regardless of the percentage of lime adopted, the optimum moisture content increases while the maximum dry density decreases when the<sep>Multiple earthquakes that occur during short seismic intervals affect the inelastic behavior of the structures. Sequential ground motions against the single earthquake event cause the building structure to face loss in stiffness and its strength. Although, numerous research studies had been conducted in this research area but still significant limitations exist such as: 1) use of traditional design procedure which usually considers single seismic excitation; 2) selecting a seismic excitation data based on earthquake events occurred at another place and time. Therefore, it is important to study the effects of successive ground motions on the framed structures. The objective of this study is to overcome the aforementioned limitations through testing a two storey RC building structural model scaled down to 1/10 ratio through a similitude relation. The scaled model is examined using a shaking table. Thereafter, the experimental model results are validated with simulated results<sep>Regression analysis is a statistical methodology to investigate the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. In current era with the trend of big data, we might face some problems when performing statistical analysis for the massive volume of data. For example, the heavy burden of the computing load will cause the computation to be time consuming, the accuracy of the results might be affected in view of the vast volume of data. Hence, divided regression analysis is proposed to reduce the burden of the computing load. This approach performs subdivision of the dataset into several unique subsets, then the multiple linear regression is fi tted into each subset. The results obtained from each subset are then combined to obtain a divided regression model which is treated as the original overall dataset. The dataset used in this paper is KC Housesales Data, obtained<sep>This research presents an experimental study on the flexural strength and failure behaviour of a newly developed composite metal decking system. The newly developed metal decking system with a thickness of 0.75 mm and 1.0 mm produced by the industry requires a detailed study in strength and performances before it is launched for commercialization. A simply supported conventional reinforced concrete slab is used as the control specimen and two composite slabs with different metal thickness of steel sheet profiles were constructed and tested under a four points flexural strength test. The strength and behaviour of the slabs are recorded and comparisons with conventional slabs with composite deck slabs are made to achieve the objectives. The recorded results of three different slabs were then used to plot a load-displacement graph and deflection profiles are to be analysed and compared. The yield flexural capacity and average yield<sep>Background This study introduces an innovative personnel training method for facility management and maintenance of Thermal-Energy-Storage (TES) chiller plants using a serious 3D game. Training games can improve the decision-making of personnel where they can learn to deal with management of TES chiller plants in the context of this study in an active learning approach. Intervention The research aims to investigate the effectiveness of an immersive learning experience with computerized simulation and synthetic task environments as a training game for facility managers. The serious 3D game adopts a first-person perspective, allowing players to assume the role of a facility manager and actively learn how to address maintenance issues commonly encountered in chiller plants. Methods The study implemented a first-person-based serious 3D game centered around a TES chiller plant. Participants, in the role of facility managers, engaged with the game and followed instructions to gain practical<sep>Industrial Revolution 4.0 has led to the age of automation and industrialized building systems. Composite slabs gain its popularity in the modern construction industry due to its speed of construction and cost saving features with lightweight structure. However, from time to time the manufacturer will introduce new corrugated roll forming cold formed steel metal decking systems, which cause the end user to ponder if the product is up to desired performances. The aim of this research is to study the structural performance of SMARTDEK composite slab composed of 0.75 mm and 1.0 mm thickness compared to the conventional reinforced concrete slab under flexural strength, deflection, and failure mode. Concrete slab with thickness of 130 mm was constructed to uncover the ultimate load capacity of the slabs.

The requirements of the companies were identified through interviews with 34 companies from 5 countries in Europe, majority of them being manufacturers across different sectors. The study aims to contribute to wider adoption of such platforms among real life companies.<sep>Situation awareness is a growing need for manufacturing operators with the digital transformation of manufacturing environments where operators are expected to take larger responsibilities and tasks on the production flow. To make effective production control decisions, workers need to be aware of the situation that consists of multiple factors such as the production status, and internal and external demand requirements. Adapting existing models for situation awareness, this paper presents four case examples of manufacturing companies that implement digital technologies for situation awareness.<sep>Augmented Reality (AR) is seen as a key technology for the development of smart manufacturing. Despite the many possibilities and affordances of this emerging technology, it is a fairly new technology in industry without widespread adoption. Research indicates that there are many affordances of using this technology in industry as well as some challenges. However, there seems to be a lack of research on how to evaluate AR in industry. Based on literature and a case study, we propose guidelines for evaluating AR based on identified dimensions.<sep>Industry 4.0 implies the digitization of the shopfloor combining technologies such as sensors, augmented reality, and wearable robots that transform the manufacturing environment into a workplace where human-machine interactive symbiosis. As manufacturing companies develop strategies to innovate and engage with the digital transformation, the reality of the enabling technologies demonstrate serious challenges to the wider organizational adoption beyond the pilot phase albeit the promising evaluation results. This paper presents two cases based on two European research projects encompassing representatives of different industrial sectors and distils the challenges encountered that raise barriers to wider adoption.<sep>The Operator 4.0 represents a recent paradigm within the transformation potential heralded by Industry 4.0. Since there is a lack of practice-oriented tools, grounded in sound theory, to implement the Operator 4.0 successfully, this paper presents the assessment tool developed within the \\xABDigitally Enhanced Operator\\xBB project. The tool covers 3 areas of analysis (i.e., Work Organization & Shop Floor Characteristics, Situation Awareness & Decision Making, Technological Support), a set of dimensions and a four-level maturity scale. This work contributes to advance knowledge and to help manufacturers consider the Organizational, Human and Technological aspects in their journey to Industry 4.0.<sep>This paper presents an industrial case of applying co-creation principles for the design of smart industry 4.0 solution within the context of three distinct end-user organizations ranging from aeronautics, robot and furniture manufacturing. The purpose was to develop a digital solution that monitors the operators and their environment to recognise the context and determine whether an operator requires support, subsequently triggering the most appropriate interventions for the operator to excel at their work whilst maintaining their well-being. The paper documents the process followed, results and lessons learnt in applying co-creation principles in the elicitation of requirements in human centered manufacturing work environments.<sep>This paper discusses how continuous improvement activities can be supported by augmenting the operators in production. After a brief literature background, real life case examples from manufacturing companies are provided and discussed. Enabling technologies, specifically AR and embedded sensors, can guide the operators in execution of their tasks, quality verification of work done step by step, and data collection from both manual and automated operations in much higher levels of details. Collected data provides an empirical foundation for data-driven analysis and improvement potentials in production and quality operations. The paper contributes to theory and practice by providing research-based innovation experiences on this emerging topic of interest for manufacturing companies.<sep>Automatically monitoring and quantifying stress-induced thermal dynamic information in real-world settings is an extremely important but challenging problem. In this paper, we explore whether we can use mobile thermal imaging to measure the rich physiological cues of mental stress that can be deduced from a person's nose temperature. To answer this question we build i) a framework for monitoring nasal thermal variable patterns continuously and ii) a novel set of thermal variability metrics to capture a richness of the dynamic information. We evaluated our approach in a series of studies including laboratory-based psychosocial stress-induction tasks and real-world factory settings. We demonstrate our approach has the potential for assessing stress responses beyond controlled laboratory settings.<sep>Automatically monitoring and quantifying stress-induced thermal dynamic information in real-world settings is an extremely important but challenging problem.

This data likely also contains references to actions of a single worker, which can be considered personal data. Privacy dashboards convey information on what personal data is stored by a system and provide means for users of a system to control what personal data is shared according to their needs. Dashboards put the control over their personal data in the hands of the users. However, to act as a trust building component, the dashboard needs to convey or mediate the trade-off between the user’s privacy and the benefits of data sharing. This work describes the design process and an elicitation of preliminary requirements for a privacy dashboard that is developed in the context of the H2020 project HUMAN Manufacturing.<sep>Games have long been considered as a means to support effective learning, motivate learners and accelerate their learning. Several successful studies using game-based learning are reported in the literature. However, there appears to be a research gap on systematically evaluating accelerated learning in game environments. The main research question we address in this paper is how can we evaluate accelerated learning in game-based learning environments? The main contribution of this paper will be a framework for evaluating accelerated learning in games (ALF). We will illustrate the use of this framework by describing studies conducted in the Norwegian industrial project ALTT (Accelerate Learning Through Technology), aimed at capacity building in the aluminium industry, where we have co-designed a game for accelerating learning about the electrolysis process for extracting aluminium and heat balance in the aluminium production cells.<sep>Games have long been considered as a means to support effective learning, motivate learners and accelerate their learning.

However, because the focus has typically been on the verbal output of the formed impressions, little is known about how impressions resulting from different trait combinations impact perceivers' expectations about facial content. Here, we offer initial evidence about how trait integration occurs in social face perception. In two studies, we used a reverse correlation paradigm to obtain face images reflecting participants' expectations about facial content for different trait combinations of dominance and trustworthiness. Analyses of the physical and perceived content of these images suggest that: (a) trustworthiness information outweighs dominance information in expectations about facial content; and (b) the face content derived from any trait combination contains information that goes beyond the content associated with each separate trait. These findings extend the research on trait integration to social face perception.<sep>HCI often produces improved systems through co-creation with practitioners. However, evaluation methods are primarily researcher-led (i.e., not co-created with practitioners). As part of a games-based learning evaluation, we detail a novel co-creation method that produces evaluations on how technology influences learning. Based upon educational threshold concept theories, the Tricky Topic method supported the co-creation of knowledge-based evaluation questionnaires with trainers. The evaluation involved 116 new recruit police officers from three UK police forces who participated in a randomized-control trial. The Tricky Topic method provided insights of how the game significantly increased understanding p< .001 (moderate effect size) in comparison with face-to-face training. Tricky topic breakdowns identify increased tacit understanding (e.g., empathy, attention) after games training, and decreased tacit understanding (e.g., respect) after face-to face training. Finally, further research opportunities are discussed concerning co-created evaluation for valid and relevant deconstruction of participants’ understanding that allow designers to pinpoint systems-specific learning benefits.<sep>Lean Startup is described as the application of lean thinking to the process of innovation, where a process of validated learning allows entrepreneurs to develop and test their products through frequent experiments. Such learning capabilities remain critical as we progress into an era of digitalization, where an abundance of data promises to advance the way in which many organizations develop problem-solving capabilities to learn to do better business. Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide insight into how the lean startup methodology can be used to develop digital solutions which enable manufacturers to better solve their problem-solving problems in the digital era. We present insights from an innovative new startup company that has adopted the lean startup methodology to develop an augmented reality solution that promises to support and enhance the problem-solving capabilities of the operators of the future. The insights have relevance for both practitioners and researchers.<sep>Abstract In this article we directly assessed the relationship between valence and relevant traits of the Big Two dimensions (i.e., communion and agency). Drawing on previous research, we expected that the relationship with valence would be less monotonous and more variable in direction across agency‐related traits, compared to communion‐related traits. In three repeated measures studies we assessed the perceived valence of each trait dimension on a continuum of seven points. Studies 1 and 2 defined each continuum verbally. In Study 3 each continuum was defined by facial features. Results across these studies show that valence is linearly and more consistently related with communion‐related traits than with agency‐related traits. Within agency, however, competence established a positive linear relationship with valence, whereas dominance showed a target‐sensitive relationship with valence: quadratic in evaluation of trait concepts, and negative and linear in face evaluation. We discuss the implications of these data for Big Two‐related research.<sep>As a pandemic spread throughout the world in 2020, restricting possibilities of physical presence, ‘going digital’ became acutely necessary for analogue serious game providers. Digitalization of analogue serious games based on player interaction is an arduous task requiring a substantial rethinking of the relationship between players, the facilitator(s), the game, and technology. Empirical research on the matter is inadequate, leaving practitioners without proper guidance in carrying out the digitalization process. This paper presents a novel framework, called the ‘Participant Centred Framework’, that can aid in moving from the analogue to the digital medium. The framework consists of several categories of relationships we believe instrumental in reimagining games for the digital realm. For each of these categories, several factors or topics to consider are included. The Participant Centred Framework is presented alongside a detailing of what we learned during our own, iterative digitalization process – mapped to the categories and factors of the framework.<sep>Abstract The article explores whether the traits representing the dimensions underlying the structure of facial and non‐facial impressions are similarly mapped in the face space. Two studies examine whether the trustworthiness‐by‐dominance and the warmth‐by‐competence two‐dimensional models overlap in face perception. In Study 1 ( N = 200), we used a reverse‐correlation task to obtain classification images ( CI s) reflecting how each dimension is mapped onto a face. Results show that the similarity between CI s was higher between warmth and trustworthiness than between competence and dominance. In Study 2 ( N = 31) the evaluations of each CI on each social dimension show a higher dissociation between dominance and competence than between trustworthiness and warmth. These results, obtained at both perceptual and judgment levels, suggest that there is only a partial correspondence between the two models that seems to be driven by the relationship that the competence and dominance dimensions establish with valence.<sep>Recognizing the role that facial appearance plays in guiding social interactions, here we investigated how occlusions of the bottom-face region affect facial impressions of trustworthiness and dominance. Previous studies suggesting that different facial features impact inferences on these traits sustain the hypothesis that wearing a face mask will differently affect each trait inference. And specifically, that trustworthiness impressions will be more disrupted by this type of face occlusion than dominance impressions. In two studies, we addressed this possibility by occluding the bottom face region of faces that were previously shown to convey different levels of dominance and trustworthiness, and tested differences in the ability to discriminate between these trait levels across occlusion conditions. In Study 1 faces were occluded by a mask, and in Study 2 by a square image. In both studies, results showed that although facial occlusions generally reduced participants' confidence on their trait judgments, the ability to discriminate facial trustworthiness was more strongly affected than the ability to discriminate facial dominance. Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.<sep>Within supply chains, companies have difficulties in finding suppliers outside their known supplier pool or geographical areas. The EU project MANUSQUARE aims to deploy a marketplace to match supply and demand of supply chain resources to facilitate accurate and efficient matchmaking. To this end, a semantic matching algorithm has been developed as one of the key enablers of such a marketplace. The algorithm exploits formal descriptions of resources provided by an ontology developed in the project and will later be extended to incorporate additional data from different endpoints. This paper describes the main components of the semantic matching algorithm, which on the basis of the formally described supply chain resources returns a ranked list of relevant suppliers given a customer query. The paper further describes a comparative evaluation of a set of common semantic similarity techniques that was conducted in order to identify the most appropriate technique for our purpose. The results from the evaluation show that all four techniques perform pretty well and are able to distinguish relevant suppliers from irrelevant ones. The best performing technique is the edge-based technique Wu-Palmer.<sep>Designing games for learning in the workplace is challenging in many ways. Within the process industry, the aluminium production cells are harsh environments that are difficult to instrument and pose domain related challenges, which make effective training difficult to achieve. In particular, cognitive challenges arise due to the slow nature of the physical process that disconnects the operators' actions and causality. The complex chemical process demands a high level of understanding of the parameters and their complex interdependencies. Additional challenges are related to representing an appropriate level of detail and precision of the workplace, including integration with existing tools. This paper describes the digital simulation game designed and developed for the operators in aluminium plants to master the cognitive skills required for Heat Balance in the aluminium production cells. A co-design process was adopted from the initial inception of the idea, development and evaluation. The paper will discuss and present the co-creation artefacts used, namely a paper prototype, hybrid prototype of the game along with the output from iterative development cycles. This work is conducted within the research and innovation project, Accelerated Learning for Technology Transfer, with the Norwegian company Hydro.<sep>Operators in industrial manufacturing environments are under pressure to cope with the ever increasing flexibility and complexity of work. Transitioning towards data-driven smart manufacturing environments in the context of Industry 4.0 with wearable technologies and sensors brings the opportunity to (1) use the recorded data to deliver timely assistance to the operator and (2) employ it in retrospective for work process optimisation. Despite these clear opportunities challenges are raised concerning the perceived threats of the usage of the data that outweigh the perceived benefits. Thus, it is paramount to strongly consider privacy concerns when designing a system for a smart manufacturing environments from the onset rather than an afterthought. This paper presents a trust and privacy framework to address these challenges by facilitating the understanding of the role of trust and privacy in complex smart manufacturing systems. The framework is instantiated in the context of a smart manufacturing system developed in the EU H2020 HUMAN project and evaluated in three studies towards its perceived usefulness and its impact on the privacy awareness in a concrete smart manufacturing application scenario. The evaluation results show that the framework helps to structure and understand the data-flow in a smart manufacturing scenario from a privacy perspective.<sep>Artificial intelligence increasingly plays a crucial role in daily life. At the same time, artificial intelligence is often met with reluctance and distrust. Previous research demonstrated that faces that are visibly artificial are considered to be less trustworthy and remembered less accurately compared to natural faces. Current technology, however, enables the generation of artificial faces that are indistinguishable from natural faces. In five experiments (total N = 867), we tested whether natural faces that are merely labelled to be artificial are also trusted less. A meta-analysis of all five experiments suggested that natural faces merely labeled as being artificial were judged to be less trustworthy. This bias did not depend on the degree of trustworthiness and attractiveness of the faces (Experiments 1-3). It was not modulated by changing raters’ attitude towards artificial intelligence (Experiments 2-3) or by information communicated by the faces (Experiment 4). We also did not observe differences in recall performance between faces labelled as artificial or natural (Experiment 3). When participants only judged one type of face (i.e., either labelled as artificial or natural), the difference in trustworthiness judgments was eliminated (Experiment 5) suggesting that the contrast between the natural and artificial categories in the same task promoted the labelling effect. We conclude that faces that are merely labelled to be artificial are trusted less in situations that also include faces labelled to be real. We propose that understanding and changing social evaluations towards artificial intelligence goes beyond eliminating physical differences between artificial and natural entities.<sep>Abstract Previous research has mostly approached face recognition and target identification by focusing on face perception mechanisms, but memory mechanisms also appear to play a role. Here, we examined how the presence of a mask interferes with the memory mechanisms involved in face recognition, focusing on the dynamic interplay between encoding and recognition processes. We approach two known memory effects: (a) matching study and test conditions effects (i.e., by presenting masked and/or unmasked faces) and (b) testing expectation effects (i.e., knowing in advance that a mask could be put on or taken off). Across three experiments using a yes/no recognition paradigm, the presence of a mask was orthogonally manipulated at the study and the test phases. All data showed no evidence of matching effects. In Experiment 1, the presence of masks either at study or test impaired the correct identification of a target. But in Experiments 2 and 3, in which the presence of masks at study or test was manipulated within participants, only masks presented at test-only impaired face identification. In these conditions, test expectations led participants to use similar encoding strategies to process masked and unmasked faces. Across all studies, participants were more liberal (i.e., used a more lenient criterion) when identifying masked faces presented at the test. We discuss these results and propose that to better understand how people may identify a face wearing a mask, researchers should take into account that memory is an active process of discrimination, in which expectations regarding test conditions may induce an encoding strategy that enables overcoming perceptual deficits.</abstract>", "<keyword>Disease<sep>Creatine kinase<sep>Conversation<sep>In vivo<sep>Order (exchange)<sep>Action (physics)<sep>Outcome (game theory)<sep>Tumor necrosis factor alpha<sep>Focus (optics)<sep>Perspective (graphical)<sep>Microblogging<sep>Inflammation<sep>Harm<sep>Politics<sep>Key (lock)<sep>Immune system<sep>Cytokine<sep>Mechanism (biology)<sep>TLR4<sep>Social media<sep>Categorization<sep>Conversation analysis<sep>Service (business)<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Variety (cybernetics)<sep>Scrutiny<sep>Hidradenitis suppurativa<sep>Chemokine<sep>Inflammasome<sep>Corporate governance<sep>Downregulation and upregulation<sep>Myeloid<sep>Humanized mouse<sep>Gene<sep>Rheumatoid arthritis</keyword><title>In case of emergency, order pizza<sep>A Study of Cyber Hate on Twitter with Implications for Social Media Governance Strategies<sep>A Study of Cyber Hate on Twitter with Implications for Social Media\n  Governance Strategies<sep>Harvey Sacks, membership categorization and social media<sep>Society in the Digital Age: An Interactionist Perspective<sep>Can humans simulate talking like other humans?

This is partly because current approaches prioritize abstract context over practical action, and tend to ignore the detailed, sequential structure of talk by emulating scripted, often stereotypical dialogue. This provocation paper analyzes an urgent case of how a caller and a 911 dispatcher work together to achieve action recognition. We outline their 'seen but unnoticed' interactional methods and suggest how computational systems can learn from conversation analysis and use micro-analytic detail to recognize social actions.<sep>This paper explores ways in which the harmful effects of cyber hate may be mitigated through mechanisms for enhancing the self-governance of new digital spaces.

The chapter argues that his ideas surrounding membership categorization and their development by key ethnomethodologists provide a live apparatus that generates insight into routine practices associated with the everyday use, practical experience and navigation of prominent social media platforms such as Twitter. The chapter considers some of these through a number of illustrative empirical examples and reflects on how social media culture-in-action represents an increasingly important site for ethno-inquiries that have a focus on membership categorization analysis in digitally networked times.<sep>In Digital Society: An Interactionist Perspective, William Housley explores the ways interactionist thinking contributes to our understanding of current trends and topics within digital sociology. Drawing on a range of aligned approaches, concepts and empirical studies, he explores how notions of self and presentation, action and agency, practical reason and interaction are of fundamental importance to our understanding of some of the emerging contours of digital society; inclusive of big data, social media, the social life of methods, algorithmic culture, ‘artificial intelligence’ and the pivot to voice. In doing so, Housley aims to demonstrate the enduring relevance of work associated with Goffman, Garfinkel and Sacks in understanding everyday digital social life. The book provides a range of insights into how sociology and social science continues to draw upon interactionism and aligned traditions such as ethnomethodology in making sense of the Interaction Order 2.0 and beyond.<sep>How authentic are inquiry calls made by simulated clients, or ‘mystery shoppers’, to service organizations, when compared to real callers? We analysed 48 simulated and 63 real inquiry calls to different veterinary practices in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The data were transcribed for conversation analysis, as well as coded for a variety of call categories including reason for the call, call outcome and turn design features. Analysis revealed systematic differences between real and simulated calls in terms of (1) reasons for the call, call outcome and call duration and (2) how callers refer to their pets in service requests and follow-up questions about their animal. Our qualitative analyses were supported with statistical summaries and tests. The findings reveal the limitations of mystery shopper methodology for the assessment of service provision. We also discuss the implications of the findings for the use of simulated encounters and the development of conversational agents.<sep>Social media exhibits the core characteristics of emergent technologies. It is disruptive of established ways of organising social relations, is evolving at an exponential pace and its effects, including the production of new ‘goods’ and ‘bads’, are highly uncertain. Interest in understanding these effects has intensified in the context of fears over so-called ‘digital wildfire’, a policy construct referring to rapid propagation of harmful communications, particularly those involving children and other vulnerable social groups but also those threatening the integrity of the political process in liberal democracies. Even so, proponents of social media are anxious to protect its potential for enhancing freedom of speech and revitalising civil society through the redistribution of editorial powers to shape public debate and facilitate the democratic scrutiny and oversight of elites. This article reports findings of the ‘Digital Wildfire policy Delphi’, which asked key informants to consider the political and technical feasibility of regulating harmful social media communications and to forecast likely scenarios for their prospective governance. Key forecasts are that forms of enforcement are limited, stimulating ‘self-regulation’ will become increasingly important but, more controversially, the likelihood is that harm to vulnerable groups will be ‘accommodated’ in liberal democracies as a price to be paid for the perceived political and economic benefits of unmoderated social media. The article concludes with conjectures about future directions in the policing of social media and their implications for shaping the emerging research agenda.<sep>Mouse models with humanized immune systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in pharmaceutical research as a platform for preclinical testing with potential for greater translatability to clinical applications. However, the presence of both mouse and human cells that respond to TLR ligands poses a challenge for investigating therapeutic modalities targeting TLR signaling. AZ617 is a human TLR4 agonist, which has been shown in vitro to preferentially induce human cytokines via the TLR4 signaling pathway. We sought to examine the ability of AZ617 to preferentially induce human cytokines in CD34+ stem cell-engrafted NOG-EXL mice (huNOG-EXL), to determine its suitability as an in vivo human functional readout. AZ617 elicited a strong human TNFα and IL-6 response in vivo that demonstrated a 10- and 5-fold preference, respectively, over the mouse TNFα and IL-6. To assess efficacy of inhibiting a key protein in the TLR4 signaling pathway, PF-06650833, a small molecule inhibitor of IRAK4, was used as a tool molecule. PF-0660833 was found to effectively inhibit AZ617-induced human TNFα release in vitro. Likewise, PF-06650833 reduced AZ617-induced human TNFα in the huNOG-EXL mouse model, with a weaker effect on human IL-6. A longitudinal study tracking functionality of monocytes revealed that the ability of monocytes to respond to ex vivo stimuli was increased by 21 weeks after engraftment. Taken together, our data suggests that human selective TLR ligands could preferentially drive cytokine production from human cells in huNOG-EXL mice. This model will allow for investigation of pharmacological inhibition of human TLR signaling pathways in an in vivo model system.<sep>Treatment for the debilitating disease hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is inadequate in many patients. Despite an incidence of approximately 1%, HS is often under-recognized and underdiagnosed, and is associated with a high morbidity and poor quality of life.To gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HS, in order to design new therapeutic strategies.We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyse gene expression in immune cells isolated from involved HS skin vs. healthy skin. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the absolute numbers of the main immune populations. The secretion of inflammatory mediators from skin explant cultures was measured using multiplex and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified a significant enrichment in the frequency of plasma cells, T helper (Th) 17 cells and dendritic cell subsets in HS skin, and the immune transcriptome was distinct and more heterogeneous than healthy skin. Flow cytometry revealed significantly increased numbers of T cells, B cells, neutrophils, dermal macrophages and dendritic cells in HS skin. Genes and pathways associated with Th17 cells, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-1β and the NLRP3 inflammasome were enhanced in HS skin, particularly in samples with a high inflammatory load. Inflammasome constituent genes principally mapped to Langerhans cells and a subpopulation of dendritic cells. The secretome of HS skin explants contained significantly increased concentrations of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β and IL-17A, and culture with an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor significantly reduced the secretion of these, as well as other, key mediators of inflammation.These data provide a rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in HS using small-molecule inhibitors that are currently being tested for other indications.<sep>This study was undertaken to understand the mechanistic basis of response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies and to determine whether transcriptomic changes in the synovium are reflected in peripheral protein markers.Synovial tissue from 46 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was profiled with RNA sequencing before and 12 weeks after treatment with anti-TNF therapies. Pathway and gene signature analyses were performed on RNA expression profiles of synovial biopsies to identify mechanisms that could discriminate among patients with a good response, a moderate response, or no response, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR response criteria. Serum proteins encoded by synovial genes that were differentially expressed between ACR/EULAR response groups were measured in the same patients.Gene signatures predicted which patients would have good responses, and pathway analysis identified elevated immune pathways, including chemokine signaling, Th1/Th2 cell differentiation, and Toll-like receptor signaling, uniquely in good responders. These inflammatory pathways were correspondingly down-modulated by anti-TNF therapy only in good responders. Based on cell signature analysis, lymphocyte, myeloid, and fibroblast cell populations were elevated in good responders relative to nonresponders, consistent with the increased inflammatory pathways. Cell signatures that decreased following anti-TNF treatment were predominately associated with lymphocytes, and fewer were associated with myeloid and fibroblast populations. Following anti-TNF treatment, and only in good responders, several peripheral inflammatory proteins decreased in a manner that was consistent with corresponding synovial gene changes.Collectively, these data suggest that RA patients with robust responses to anti-TNF therapies are characterized at baseline by immune pathway activation, which decreases following anti-TNF treatment. Understanding mechanisms that define patient responsiveness to anti-TNF treatment may assist in development of predictive markers of patient response and earlier treatment options.<sep><h3>Background:</h3> JAK inhibitors, including Upadacitinib (UPA), have been associated with increased serum levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in patients with inflammatory disorders, but not in patients with myeloproliferative disease or in healthy subjects treated for a limited duration (1). While CPK increases can be indicative of muscle damage, there are no other indicators of muscle pathology observed with JAK inhibitors, suggesting that there may be another mechanism behind the increased CPK levels. Inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis are often associated with reduced muscle mass (sarcopenia), a process reversed with disease control (2). <h3>Objectives:</h3> We hypothesized that one or more cytokines present in the inflammatory milieu may block differentiation of myoblasts into mature myocytes and that JAK inhibition restores differentiation and associated CPK expression. We focused on the gp130-mediated cytokines IL6, Oncostatin M (OSM), CNTF, and LIF as these have been shown to impact myoblast differentiation. <h3>Methods:</h3> Human skeletal muscle myoblast (HSMM) cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum, or were serum starved (2% horse serum) to induce differentiation into myocytes, with and without stimulation with OSM (1–100 ng/ml) and/or UPA (0.0007–1 μM) for up to 5 days. RNA was purified and expression of CPK (M-type) was determined by QPCR using GAPDH as a reference. CPK expression was also measured following stimulation of HSMM cells with other JAK inhibitors (Baricitinib and Tofacitinib). <h3>Results:</h3> We have demonstrated that the gp130-mediated cytokine oncostatin M blocks myoblast differentiation into myotubules resulting in a decrease in CPK expression. Jak inhibition restores muscle differentiation and increased CPK expression (Figure 1A). Oncostatin M is highly expressed in RA synovium and other inflammatory milieu and may be one mechanism driving sarcopenia in RA. In addition to Upadacitinib, both Baricitinib and Tofacitinib restore myoblast differentiation suggesting that this is a class effect for JAK inhibitors (Figure 1B). <h3>Conclusion:</h3> Our studies suggest that the increase in serum CPK upon treatment with JAK inhibitors may represent recovery of muscle development via reversal of inflammation-associated inhibition of myoblast differentiation <h3>References:</h3> [1] J.

Fecha de Lectura 25-02-2019<sep>The pentafluorophenyl (PFP) moiety is an important and versatile substituent in the chemistry of BODIPYs, porphyrins and corroles. The widespread use of PFP meso-substituted compounds, as intermediates in the synthesis of more complex pyrrole derivatives, is the motivation behind this work, which investigates the optical properties of the meso-PFP-BODIPY from a theoretical point of view. From the panoply of computational tools available for this purpose, we have considered the MS-CASPT2//CASSCF multiconfigurational protocol, and other monoreference methods, including time dependent density functional theory, TD-DFT, the second order approximate couple cluster, CC2, and the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme of the polarization propagator in its second order, ADC(2). We have identified ADC(2) as the most suited method for the characterization of the absorption properties of BODIPYs. Besides its computational efficiency and the small dependence shown towards the basis set flexibility, the results obtained with this method are independent from the preexisting knowledge of the system and its properties to be calculated by the user. In general, all the methods evaluated show a good performance when compared with experimental results, especially if implicit solvent effects are taken into account, delivering errors which amount to 0.05 eV. Finally, we discuss the effect of the electron-withdrawing PFP substituent at the meso-position on the absorption and emission energies of the boron-dipyrromethene core. The comparison of the PFP-substituted and core BODIPY spectroscopic properties reveals that this substituent red-shifts both the absorption and the emission of the parent dye. On the one hand, the incorporation of this substituent was found to reduce the HOMO-LUMO gap, and on the other it induces a strong destabilization of the electronic ground state along the global coordinate leading the system from the Franck-Condon region to the position of the first excited state, S1, minimum, suggesting a lower S1/S0 internal conversion funnel compared to the parent BODIPY compound.</abstract>", "<keyword>Neuropathic pain<sep>Hedgehog<sep>Hematopoietic cell<sep>Vaccination<sep>Nose<sep>Neurodegeneration<sep>BAP1<sep>Publication<sep>Cochrane Library<sep>Immune system<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Science Citation Index<sep>Multiple sclerosis<sep>Otorhinolaryngology<sep>Transplantation<sep>Logistic regression<sep>Head and neck surgery<sep>Sanger sequencing<sep>Proportional hazards model<sep>Coursework<sep>Cross-sectional study<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Transcriptome<sep>Breast reconstruction<sep>Multivariate analysis<sep>Hierarchy<sep>Booster (rocketry)<sep>Gene<sep>Citation<sep>Relative risk<sep>Scars<sep>Macular degeneration<sep>Disease<sep>Epidermis (zoology)<sep>Meta-analysis<sep>Mentorship<sep>KRAS<sep>Cancer<sep>Perforation<sep>Confidence interval<sep>Wound healing<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>Myelofibrosis<sep>Epidemiology<sep>Clinical trial<sep>Exome sequencing<sep>Antibody<sep>Pathogenesis<sep>Adverse effect<sep>KLF4<sep>Term (time)<sep>Neurology<sep>Randomized controlled trial<sep>Hazard ratio<sep>RHOB<sep>Cohort<sep>Microsatellite instability<sep>Microglia<sep>Ranking (information retrieval)<sep>Impact factor<sep>Mutation<sep>Productivity<sep>Degeneration (medical)<sep>Limiting<sep>Clinical neurology<sep>DNA sequencing<sep>Medical diagnosis<sep>Titer<sep>RHOA<sep>Radiomics<sep>Emergency department<sep>Subspecialty<sep>Population<sep>Retrospective cohort study<sep>Survival analysis<sep>Proband<sep>Turnover<sep>Meningioma<sep>MEDLINE<sep>CDKN2A<sep>Diversity (politics)<sep>Correlation<sep>2019-20 coronavirus outbreak<sep>Neurosurgery<sep>Topology (electrical circuits)<sep>Trigeminal neuralgia<sep>Neuroinflammation<sep>Adjuvant therapy<sep>Subgroup analysis<sep>Immunofluorescence<sep>Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors<sep>Confounding<sep>Implant<sep>Exome<sep>SMARCB1<sep>Immunotherapy<sep>Bibliometrics<sep>Odds ratio<sep>Blastema<sep>Regeneration (biology)<sep>Neutralizing antibody<sep>Psychosocial<sep>Colorectal cancer<sep>Signal transduction</keyword><title>Trends in clinical trials for olfactory dysfunction in the COVID‐19 era<sep>Physician Turnover Among Otolaryngologists in the United States, 2014–2021<sep>Analysis workflow to assess de novo genetic variants from human whole-exome sequencing<sep>Clinical trial publication trends within neurology<sep>Exome Sequencing Implicates Impaired GABA Signaling and Neuronal Ion Transport in Trigeminal Neuralgia<sep>Topological Analysis of Single-Cell Hierarchy Reveals Inflammatory Glial Landscape of Macular Degeneration<sep>Mutations disrupting neuritogenesis genes confer risk for cerebral palsy<sep>Adverse Events Associated With Bioabsorbable Nasal Implants: A MAUDE Database Analysis<sep>Initiatives for Early Medical Student Engagement with the Field of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery<sep>Epimorphic regeneration in the mammalian tympanic membrane<sep>Single-cell analysis reveals inflammatory interactions driving macular degeneration<sep>Imaging and Radiomics of Immuno-oncology of Primary and Secondary Gastrointestinal Malignancies<sep>Topological analysis of single-cell data reveals shared glial landscape of macular degeneration and neurodegenerative diseases<sep>Is Public Interest Associated with Real‐World Management of Ankyloglossia?<sep>Disruption Index in Otolaryngology: Uncovering a Bibliometric History of a Rapidly Evolving Field<sep>Patients with psychiatric illness report worse patient‐reported outcomes and receive lower rates of autologous breast reconstruction<sep>Abstract 19: Presence Of Psychiatric Diagnosis Negatively Impacts Patient-Reported Outcomes And Decreases Likelihood Of Autologous Reconstruction<sep>Associations of meningioma molecular subgroup and tumor recurrence<sep>Emergency Department Presentations of Acute Primary Angle Closure in the United States from 2008 to 2017<sep>Microsatellite Instability and KRAS Mutation in Stage IV Colorectal Cancer: Prevalence, Geographic Discrepancies, and Outcomes From the National Cancer Database<sep>Clinical Variables Correlate with Serum Neutralizing Antibody Titers after COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination in an Adult, US-based Population<sep>Preresidency Publication Productivity of U.S. Neurosurgery Interns<sep>Analysis of the Frequency, Characteristics, and Reasons for Termination of Spine-related Clinical Trials<sep>GENE-56.

During this period, the cumulative turnover rate among otolaryngologists was 36.4%, with annual turnover rates ranging between 6.2%-10.2%. Otolaryngologist turnover rates varied by career stage and group size.<sep>Here, we present a protocol to analyze de novo genetic variants derived from the whole-exome sequencing (WES) of proband-parent trios. We provide stepwise instructions for using existing pipelines to call de novo mutations (DNMs) and determine whether the observed number of such mutations is enriched relative to the expected number. This protocol may be extended to any human disease trio-based cohort. Cohort size is a limiting determinant to the discovery of high-confidence pathogenic DNMs. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Dong et al. (2020).<sep>Timely dissemination of results from clinical studies is crucial for the advancement of knowledge and clinical decision making. A large body of research has shown that up to half of clinical trials do not publish their findings. In this study, we sought to determine whether clinical trial publication rates within neurology have increased over time. Focusing on neurology clinical trials completed between 2008 to 2014, we found that while the overall percentage of published trials has not changed (remaining at approximately 50%), time to publication has significantly decreased. Our findings suggest that clinical trials within neurology are being published in a more timely manner.<sep>Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common, debilitating neuropathic face pain syndrome often resistant to therapy. The familial clustering of TN cases suggests that genetic factors play a role in disease pathogenesis. However, no unbiased, large-scale genomic study of TN has been performed to date. Analysis of 290 whole exome-sequenced TN probands, including 20 multiplex kindreds and 70 parent-offspring trios, revealed enrichment of rare, damaging variants in GABA receptor-binding genes in cases. Mice engineered with a TN-associated de novo mutation (p.Cys188Trp) in the GABAA receptor Cl- channel γ-1 subunit (GABRG1) exhibited trigeminal mechanical allodynia and face pain behavior. Other TN probands harbored rare damaging variants in Na+ and Ca+ channels, including a<sep>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disease of the retina with unknown cellular drivers. To identify, characterize, and compare rare pathogenic clusters of cells, we developed CATCH, a coarse graining framework that learns the cellular hierarchy. CATCH includes a suite of tools that identify salient levels of the hierarchy, automatically characterize clusters, identify pathogenic populations, and rapidly compute differentially expressed genes. We applied CATCH to the first single-cell atlas of AMD and identified two populations of activated glia enriched in the early phase of disease, one microglial and one astrocyte. Applying CATCH to other degenerative diseases revealed the same activated states in early disease, indicating a common glial signature during<sep>In addition to commonly associated environmental factors, genomic factors may cause cerebral palsy. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 250 parent-offspring trios, and observed enrichment of damaging de novo mutations in cerebral palsy cases. Eight genes had multiple damaging de novo mutations; of these, two (TUBA1A and CTNNB1) met genome-wide significance. We identified two novel monogenic etiologies, FBXO31 and RHOB, and showed that the RHOB mutation enhances active-state Rho effector binding while the FBXO31 mutation diminishes cyclin D levels. Candidate cerebral palsy risk genes overlapped with neurodevelopmental disorder genes. Network analyses identified enrichment of Rho GTPase, extracellular matrix, focal adhesion and cytoskeleton pathways. Cerebral palsy risk genes in enriched pathways were shown<sep>Bioabsorbable implants (eg, Latera) have recently been approved for addressing nasal valve collapse. The purpose of this study is to summarize adverse events and treatment sequelae associated with bioabsorbable nasal implants queried in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Of the 26 device reports entered between March 2017 and April 2022, the most frequently reported complications included abscess (n = 13) and implant protrusion (n = 5). Other common symptoms reported greater than 1-year postimplantation included facial pain/discomfort (n = 3) and failure to absorb (n = 3).

This paper presents initiatives implemented at our institution to engage early-career medical students with the field.A hands-on laryngoscope workshop was organised, and a centralised online platform was created for research and mentorship opportunities using a collaborative project management tool. Both measures were advertised via e-mail to student interest groups and campus diversity groups. At the end of the workshop, participating students completed an online distributed survey.Students' perception of their knowledge of airway anatomy and related clinical scenarios significantly improved after the laryngoscopy workshop (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). All<sep>Adult mammals are generally believed to have limited ability to regenerate complex tissues and instead, repair wounds by forming scars. In humans and across mammalian species, the tympanic membrane (TM) rapidly repairs perforations without intervention. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that the TM repairs itself through a process that bears many hallmarks of epimorphic regeneration rather than typical wound healing. Following injury, the TM forms a wound epidermis characterized by EGFR ligand expression and signaling. After the expansion of the wound epidermis that emerges from known stem cell regions of the TM, a multi-lineage blastema-like cellular mass is recruited. After two weeks, the tissue architecture of the TM is largely restored,<sep>Due to commonalities in pathophysiology, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents a uniquely accessible model to investigate therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, leading us to examine whether pathways of disease progression are shared across neurodegenerative conditions. Here we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile lesions from 11 postmortem human retinas with age-related macular degeneration and 6 control retinas with no history of retinal disease. We create a machine-learning pipeline based on recent advances in data geometry and topology and identify activated glial populations enriched in the early phase of disease. Examining single-cell data from Alzheimer's disease and progressive multiple sclerosis with our pipeline, we find a similar glial activation profile enriched in the<sep>Abstract In recent years, systemic cancer treatment has been revolutionized with the advent of immunotherapy, which utilizes the body's immune system to target cancer cells and results in unique and novel imaging patterns of cancer response and therapy-associated toxicities. Hyperprogression is defined as a rapid tumor progression after treatment initiation. In contrast, pseudoprogression is defined as a tumor response after an initial increase in tumor burden, or appearance of new tumor lesions, and observed in &lt;10% of patients undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Since traditional radiological strategies might not fully capture tumor response of patients receiving immunotherapy, several efforts have been made to better quantify specific immuno-oncological imaging patterns, including immune-related response criteria,<sep>1 One Sentence Summary A novel topological machine learning approach applied to single-nucleus RNA sequencing from human retinas with age-related macular degeneration identifies interacting disease phase-specific glial activation states shared with Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. 2 Abstract Neurodegeneration occurs in a wide range of diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis (MS), each with distinct inciting events. To determine whether glial transcriptional states are shared across phases of degeneration, we sequenced 50,498 nuclei from the retinas of seven AMD patients and six healthy controls, generating the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of AMD. We identified groupings of cells implicated in disease pathogenesis by applying a novel<sep>Abstract Objectives Assess the relationship between public interest in ankyloglossia as determined by internet search volume and real‐world medical claims data.

Herein, we aim to identify the 100 most disruptive articles in ENT over a 60‐year period and examine how disruption index (DI) compares with other bibliometrics in identifying impactful works in the field. Methods In this cross‐sectional bibliometric analysis, articles published between 1954 and 2014 in commonly referenced otolaryngology‐head and neck surgery (OHNS) journals were queried in PubMed. Publications were characterized by DI, journal, subspecialty discipline, and status as an impactful article in the field as<sep>Psychiatric well-being impacts on general satisfaction and quality of life. This study explored how the presence of psychiatric diagnoses affects patient-reported outcomes in breast reconstruction and on selection of reconstructive modality. Patients who received breast reconstruction at a tertiary hospital between 2013 and 2018 and completed the BREAST-Q survey were included. BREAST-Q module scores were compared between patients who had a psychiatric diagnosis at presentation and the remaining cohort using t tests. General linear models (GLMs) were used to control for confounding factors. A chi-squared test was used to assess the effect on reconstructive modality, and binary logistic regression was used to control for confounding factors. Of the 471 patients included,<sep>Purpose: Previous studies suggest that psychiatric health may impact surgical care. However, breast reconstruction studies have not yet evaluated the effect of psychiatric diagnoses on patient satisfaction and health-related quality-of-life. Herein, we quantitatively assess how the presence of psychiatric diagnoses affects patient-reported outcomes. Furthermore, we evaluate whether having a psychiatric diagnosis affects choice of reconstructive modality (implant vs. autologous). Methods: Patients who received breast reconstruction at Yale New Haven Hospital between 2013 and 2018 and completed the BREAST-Q survey were included. Patients were sorted: (1) one or more psychiatric diagnoses or (2) no psychiatric diagnoses. T-tests were used to identify significant differences in BREAST-Q module scores, and General Linear Models (GLM)<sep>We and others have identified mutually exclusive molecular subgroups of meningiomas; however, the implications of this classification for clinical prognostication remain unclear. Integrated genomic and epigenomic analyses implicate unique oncogenic processes associated with each subgroup, suggesting the potential for divergent clinical courses. The aim of this study was to understand the associated clinical outcomes of each subgroup, as this could optimize treatment for patients.We analyzed outcome data for 469 meningiomas of known molecular subgroup, including extent of resection, postoperative radiation, surveillance imaging, and time to recurrence, when applicable. Statistical relationships between outcome variables and subgroup were assessed. Features previously associated with recurrence were further investigated after stratification by subgroup.

One measure of research productivity is publication volume. The preresidency publication volume of U.S. neurosurgery interns and any potential association between applicant publication volume and the match results of top-ranked residency programs have not been well characterized. In this study, we sought to characterize the preresidency publication volume of U.S. neurosurgery residents in the 2018–2019 intern class using the Scopus database.

Unfortunately, trials may be terminated before completion. ClinicalTrials.gov is a registry and results database maintained by the National Library of Medicine that catalogs trial characteristics and tracks overall recruitment status (eg, ongoing, completed, terminated) for each study as well as reasons for termination. Reasons for trial termination have not been specifically evaluated for spine-related clinical trials.The ClinicalTrials.gov<sep>Abstract BACKGROUND Meningiomas can be classified into six genomic subgroups based on mutations in NF2, SMARCB1, KLF4, POLR2A, or activating variants in the PI3K or Hedgehog signaling pathways. Previous work has identified specific associations of driver events with clinical and molecular features, such as tumor location. However, their utility in predicting post-operative patient outcomes is not well-explored. Similar to recently described epigenetic signatures, underlying genomic subgroup may provide prognostic value in meningioma management. METHODS Targeted sequencing data was used to classify over 500 meningiomas into established genomic subgroups, and available patient outcome data was assembled based on retrospective chart reviews. Collected data included recurrence (based on imaging), extent of resection (EOR),<sep>INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have established relationships between meningioma molecular features and clinical outcome, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-methylation patterns, TERT promoter mutations, and various chromosomal copy number changes. These relationships stratify patients according to risk of recurrence and progression, thereby guiding difficult postoperative decisions regarding adjuvant therapies and frequency of follow-up. However, the associations of somatic driver mutations with prognosis is relatively less explored, and may yield actionable insights regarding meningioma pathogenesis and patient management. METHODS: Available outcome-related data for over 450 meningiomas was collected from retrospective chart review, including extent-of-resection, postoperative therapy, radiological recurrence, long-term clinical events, and Karnofsky performance score. All samples underwent targeted and/or whole-exome sequencing followed by independent<sep>Abstract Up to 80% of meningiomas are classified as clinically low-grade, however, a subset of these ‘benign’ cases will ultimately recur and require additional treatment. The role of molecular subgroup in meningioma recurrence has not been thoroughly investigated, despite correlations of this variable with other clinical features. Indeed, epigenetic and transcriptional evidence supports involvement of distinct oncogenic processes within each subgroup, and as shown in other brain tumors, this may result in divergent clinical courses. In the present study, we classified 429 meningiomas into six established molecular subgroups based on genomic driver, and investigated associations of each subgroup with tumor recurrence. At two years of follow-up, we observed differences in progression<sep>Abstract BACKGROUND Previous studies have established several meningioma genomic subgroups, defined by the mutually exclusive genomic drivers. However, we distinguished a small subset of meningiomas simultaneously harboring multiple drivers from different genomic subgroups, thus referred to as “multiple-driver meningiomas”, that has not been previously investigated. We aimed to characterize the genomic landscape and clinical features of multiple-driver meningiomas. METHODS We identified 42 cases of multiple-driver meningiomas from a cohort of 3,016 cases screened for genomic drivers via molecular inversion probe sequencing (MIPS) and/or whole-exome sequencing (WES) previously in our laboratory. All driver mutations were validated via Sanger sequencing and chromosome 22 loss was accessed with qPCR. Clinical information was collected and<sep>Abstract Background We studied whether comorbid conditions affect strength and duration of immune responses after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA vaccination in a US-based, adult population. Methods Sera (before and after BNT162b2 vaccination) were tested serially up to 12 months after 2 doses of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2-anti-Spike neutralizing capacity by pseudotyping assay in 124 individuals; neutralizing titers were correlated to clinical variables with multivariate regression. Postbooster (third dose) effect was measured at 1 and 3 months in 72 and 88 subjects, respectively. Results After completion of primary vaccine series, neutralizing antibody half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were high at 1 month (14-fold increase from prevaccination), declined<sep>OBJECTIVE Recent large-cohort sequencing studies have investigated the genomic landscape of meningiomas, identifying somatic coding alterations in NF2 , SMARCB1 , SMARCE1 , TRAF7, KLF4, POLR2A , BAP1 , and members of the PI3K and Hedgehog signaling pathways. Initial associations between clinical features and genomic subgroups have been described, including location, grade, and histology. However, further investigation using an expanded collection of samples is needed to confirm previous findings, as well as elucidate relationships not evident in smaller discovery cohorts.

As a result, inconsistencies in W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) expressions were identified and corrected, and additionally, standardized design patterns and a formalized template to maintain them were developed. We describe here this informative and productive process to describe the specific benefits and obstacles for OBI and<sep>Driven by the use cases of PubChemRDF and SCAIView, we have developed a first community-based clinical trial ontology (CTO) by following the OBO Foundry principles. CTO uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as the top level ontology and reuses many terms from existing ontologies. CTO has also defined many clinical trial-specific terms. The general CTO design pattern is based on the PICO framework together with two applications. First, the PubChemRDF use case demonstrates<sep>The data FAIR Guiding Principles state that all data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

Timely access to COVID-19 vaccine information is crucial to researchers and public. To support more comprehensive annotation, integration, and analysis of COVID-19 vaccine information, we have developed Cov19VaxKB, a knowledge-focused COVID-19 vaccine database (http://www.violinet.org/cov19vaxkb/). Cov19VaxKB features comprehensive lists of COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine formulations, clinical trials, publications, news articles, and vaccine adverse event case reports. A web-based<sep>Ontologies are formal representations of concepts and complex relationships among them. They have been widely used to capture comprehensive domain knowledge in areas such as biology and medicine, where large and complex ontologies can contain hundreds of thousands of concepts. Especially due to the large size of ontologies, visualisation is useful for authoring, exploring and understanding their underlying data. Existing ontology visualisation tools generally focus on the hierarchical structure, giving much less emphasis<sep>Abstract Reverse vaccinology (RV) provides a systematic approach to identifying potential vaccine candidates based on protein sequences. The integration of machine learning (ML) into this process has greatly enhanced our ability to predict viable vaccine candidates from these sequences. We have previously developed a Vaxign-ML program based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). In this study, we further extend our work to develop a Vaxign-DL program based on deep learning techniques. Deep neural<sep>Stem cells and stem cell lines are widely used in biomedical research. The Cell Ontology (CL) and Cell Line Ontology (CLO) are two community-based OBO Foundry ontologies in the domains of in vivo cells and in vitro cell line cells, respectively.

While production of toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) contribute to the main pathogenesis of C. difficile , adhesion and colonization of C. difficile in the host gut are prerequisites for disease onset. Previous cell wall proteins (CWPs) were identified that were implicated in C. difficile adhesion and colonization. In this study, we predicted and<sep>Abstract The presence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, including the emerging variant B.1.1.7, has raised great concerns in terms of pathogenesis, transmission, and immune escape. Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 mutations, evolution, and effects on infectivity and pathogenicity is crucial to the design of antibody therapies and surveillance strategies. Here, we analyzed 454,443 SARS-CoV-2 spike genes/proteins and 14,427 whole-genome sequences. We demonstrated that the early variant B.1.1.7 may not have evolved spontaneously in the United Kingdom or within<sep>Abstract The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO, https://hpo.jax.org) was launched in 2008 to provide a comprehensive logical standard to describe and computationally analyze phenotypic abnormalities found in human disease. The HPO is now a worldwide standard for phenotype exchange.

The aim of this study was to study immune features of NSCLC with different mutation burdens. We performed a comprehensive comparison of immune features, including driver mutations, up- or down-regulated expression of key biological pathways, tumor cell evolution, tumor cell stemness, etiology, and immune cell infiltration, between ultra-low<sep>Abstract Objective The goal of this study is to develop a robust Time Event Ontology (TEO), which can formally represent and reason both structured and unstructured temporal information. Materials and Methods Using our previous Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology 1.0 and 2.0 as a starting point, we redesigned concept primitives (clinical events and temporal expressions) and enriched temporal relations. Specifically, 2 sets of temporal relations (Allen’s interval algebra and a novel suite of<sep>Abstract The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths globally. Extensive efforts and progress have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we extended an<sep>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, however, its incidence, geographic distribution, and temporal trends since the start of the pandemic are understudied.Electronic health record data were obtained from 53 health systems in the United States (US) in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C).

The ability of H. pylori to cause different clinical outcomes is thought to be associated with unique sets of its genetic features. However, only few genetic features have been definitively linked to specific gastrointestinal pathologies. Genome heterogeneity of clinical H. pylori strains from patients with four different gastric disorders was studied to explore the population structure and molecular genomic features<sep>To fully understand COVID-19, it is critical to study all possible hosts of SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen of COVID-19). In this work, we collected, annotated, and performed ontology-based taxonomical analysis of all the reported and verified hosts for all human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. A total of 37 natural hosts and 19 laboratory animal hosts of human coronaviruses were identified based on experimental evidence. Our analysis found that<sep>Research on drugs against SARS-CoV-2 (cause of COVID-19) has been one of the major world concerns at present. There have been abundant research data and findings in this field. The interference of drugs on gene expression in cell lines, drug-target, protein-virus receptor networks, and immune cell infiltration of the host may provide useful information for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug research. To simplify the complex bioinformatics analysis and facilitate the evaluation of the latest research data,<sep>Traditional Chinese drugs (TCDs) have been widely used in clinical practice in China and many other regions for thousands of years. Nowadays TCD's bioactive ingredients and mechanisms of action are being identified. However, the lack of standardized terminologies or ontologies for the description of TCDs has hindered the interoperability and deep analysis of TCD knowledge and data. By aligning with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), an ISO-approved top-level ontology, we constructed a community-driven<sep>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide and claimed over 1.6 million lives in 2017. Furthermore, one-third of the world population is estimated to be latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). A safe and effective MTB vaccine that can prevent both the primary infection and the reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and that can protect against all forms of TB in adults and adolescents is urgently needed. In this<sep>Coronavirus-infected diseases have posed great threats to human health. In past years, highly infectious coronavirus-induced diseases, including COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, have resulted in world-wide severe infections. Our literature annotations identified 72 chemical drugs and 27 antibodies effective against at least one human coronavirus infection in vitro or in vivo. Many of these drugs inhibit viral entry to cells and viral replication inside cells or modulate host immune responses. Many antimicrobial drugs, including<sep>Vaccines stimulate various immune factors critical to protective immune responses. However, a comprehensive picture of vaccine-induced immune factors and pathways have not been systematically collected and analyzed. To address this issue, we developed VaximmutorDB, a web-based database system of vaccine immune factors (abbreviated as \"vaximmutors\") manually curated from peer-reviewed articles. VaximmutorDB currently stores 1,740 vaccine immune factors from 13 host species (e.g., human, mouse, and pig). These vaximmutors were induced by 154 vaccines<sep>To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection<sep>Vaccination has been one of the most successful public health interventions to date, and the U.S. FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) currently contains more than 500,000 reports for post-vaccination adverse events that occur after the administration of vaccines licensed in the United States. The VAERS dataset is huge, contains very large dimension nominal variables, and is complex due to multiple listing of vaccines and adverse symptoms in a single report. So<sep>Abstract Background The extensive international research for medications and vaccines for the devastating COVID-19 pandemic requires a standard reference ontology. Among the current COVID-19 ontologies, the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) is the largest one. Furthermore, it keeps growing very frequently. Researchers using CIDO as a reference ontology, need a quick update about the content added in a recent release to know how relevant the new concepts are to their research needs. Although<sep>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines have been developed to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These vaccines have been effective in reducing the rate and severity of COVID-19 infection but also have been associated with various adverse events (AEs). In this study, data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) was queried and analyzed via the Cov19VaxKB vaccine safety statistical analysis tool to identify statistically<sep>Abstract Background Different human responses to the same vaccine were frequently observed. For example, independent studies identified overlapping but different transcriptomic gene expression profiles in Yellow Fever vaccine 17D (YF-17D) immunized human subjects. Different experimental and analysis conditions were likely contributed to the observed differences. To investigate this issue, we developed a Vaccine Investigation Ontology (VIO), and applied VIO to classify the different variables and relations among these variables systematically. We then evaluated<sep>Drug adverse events (AEs), or called adverse drug events (ADEs), are ranked one of the leading causes of mortality. The Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) has been widely used for adverse event AE representation, standardization, and analysis. OAE-based ADE-specific ontologies, including ODNAE for drug-associated neuropathy-inducing AEs and OCVDAE for cardiovascular drug AEs, have also been developed and used. However, these ADE-specific ontologies do not consider the effects of other factors (e.g., age and<sep>While impact of heat exposure on human health is well-documented, limited research exists on its effect on kidney disease hospital admissions especially in Texas, a state with diverse demographics and a high heat-related death rate.

In this study, we systematically extracted and analyzed clinical phenotypes and comorbidities in COVID-19 patients found at different countries and regions during the early pandemic using an ontology-based<sep>Abstract Background Vaccines have revolutionized public health by providing protection against infectious diseases. They stimulate the immune system and generate memory cells to defend against targeted diseases. Clinical trials evaluate vaccine performance, including dosage, administration routes, and potential side effects. ClinicalTrials.gov is a valuable repository of clinical trial information, but the vaccine data in them lacks standardization, leading to challenges in automatic concept mapping, vaccine-related knowledge development, evidence-based decision-making, and vaccine surveillance.

However, running a basic NMF analysis requires the installation of multiple tools and dependencies, along with a steep learning curve and computing time. To mitigate such obstacles, we developed ShinyButchR, a novel R/Shiny application that provides a complete NMF-based analysis workflow, allowing the user to perform matrix decomposition using NMF, feature extraction, interactive visualization, relevant signature identification, and association to biological and clinical variables. ShinyButchR builds upon the also novel R package ButchR, which provides new TensorFlow solvers for algorithms of the NMF family, functions for downstream analysis, a rational method to determine the optimal factorization rank and a novel feature selection strategy.<sep>Understanding the role of transcription and transcription factors in cellular identity and disease, such as cancer and autoimmunity, is essential. However, comprehensive data resources for cell line-specific transcription factor-to-target gene annotations are currently limited. To address this, we developed a straightforward method to define regulons that capture the cell-specific aspects of TF binding and transcript expression levels. By integrating cellular transcriptome and transcription factor binding data, we generated regulons for four common cell lines comprising both proximal and distal cell line-specific regulatory events. Through systematic benchmarking involving transcription factor knockout experiments, we demonstrated performance on par with state-of-the-art methods, with our method being easily applicable to other cell types of interest. We present case studies using three cancer single-cell datasets to showcase the utility of these cell-type-specific regulons in exploring transcriptional dysregulation. In summary, this study provides a valuable tool and a resource for systematically exploring cell line-specific transcriptional regulations, emphasizing the utility of network analysis in deciphering disease mechanisms.<sep>Background: Heart failure represents the end-stage of a range of diseases which adversely impact the heart muscle. The extent by which cellular and molecular mechanisms differ between myocardial diseases in heart failure remains incompletely understood. Methods: We performed isolation and droplet-based RNA-sequencing of 394 247 single nuclei from 103 explanted hearts from transplant and ventricular assist device recipients and 7 unused donor hearts without heart disease. After sample and nuclei level quality control, doublet removal and sample integration; principal component analysis and shared nearest neighbor clustering were used to identify distinct cell populations. Cell type composition and transcriptomic profiles were compared across donor hearts and 10 myocardial diseases (hypertrophic, dilated, ischemic, restrictive, arrythmogenic and non-compaction cardiomyopathy; rheumatic and congenital heart disease; cardiac amyloidosis and graft rejection; n=1-45/group). Results: We identified and manually annotated 14 distinct cell populations that were present across controls and myocardial diseases, including transcriptionally diverse subgroups of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes. Compared to controls, we observed disease-specific differences in cell populations with regards to composition, heterogeneity, and specific transcriptional profiles. Conclusions: Our results reveal differences in single cell profiles of individual heart muscle diseases compared to controls without heart disease.<sep>Splicing of genomic exons into mRNAs is a critical prerequisite for the accurate synthesis of human proteins. Genetic variants impacting splicing underlie a substantial proportion of genetic disease, but are challenging to identify beyond those occurring at donor and acceptor dinucleotides. To address this, various methods aim to predict variant effects on splicing. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achieve better results in predicting splice variants than other strategies.It has been unclear how best to integrate such process-specific scores into genome-wide variant effect predictors. Here, we use a recently published experimental data set to compare several machine learning methods that score variant effects on splicing. We integrate the best of those approaches into general variant effect prediction models and observe the effect on classification of known pathogenic variants.We integrate two specialized splicing scores into CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion; cadd.gs.washington.edu ), a widely used tool for genome-wide variant effect prediction that we previously developed to weight and integrate diverse collections of genomic annotations. With this new model, CADD-Splice, we show that inclusion of splicing DNN effect scores substantially improves predictions across multiple variant categories, without compromising overall performance.While splice effect scores show superior performance on splice variants, specialized predictors cannot compete with other variant scores in general variant interpretation, as the latter account for nonsense and missense effects that do not alter splicing. Although only shown here for splice scores, we believe that the applied approach will generalize to other specific molecular processes, providing a path for the further improvement of genome-wide variant effect prediction.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Fibrosis<sep>Ventricular tachycardia<sep>Interferon<sep>Steatohepatitis<sep>Depression (economics)<sep>Heart failure<sep>Veterans Affairs<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Ablation<sep>Catheter ablation<sep>Inflammation<sep>IRF8<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Myocardial infarction<sep>Granulocyte<sep>Retrospective cohort study<sep>IRF5<sep>Prospective cohort study<sep>Tachycardia<sep>Inflammasome<sep>Hepatic stellate cell<sep>Myelopoiesis<sep>Haematopoiesis<sep>IRF3<sep>Myeloid<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Transcriptome<sep>Calcification<sep>Bone marrow</keyword><title>Abstract 11552: Breast Arterial Calcification and Risk of Heart Failure<sep>Type I interferon responses to ischemic injury begin in the bone marrow of mice and humans and depend on Tet2, Nrf2, and Irf3<sep>The myeloid type I interferon response to myocardial infarction begins in bone marrow and is regulated by Nrf2-activated macrophages<sep>NOD‐like receptor protein 3 activation causes spontaneous inflammation and fibrosis that mimics human NASH<sep>Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Livers During NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation Reveals a Novel Immune Niche<sep>SiglecF(HI) Marks Late‐Stage Neutrophils of the Infarcted Heart: A Single‐Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Neutrophil Diversification<sep>Characteristics and Outcomes of Methamphetamine Abuse Among Veterans With Heart Failure<sep>Abstract 583: Single Cell Analysis of Monocytes and Macrophages in the Infarcted Heart<sep>Abstract MP153: TET2 Regulates Type I Interferon Signaling in the Hematopoietic Response to Myocardial Infarction<sep>MP-453083-5 PROSPECTIVE REAL-TIME USE OF FORWARD-SOLUTION ECG MAPPING TO FACILITATE FOCUSED ACTIVATION MAPPING OF UNSTABLE VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA: ACCURACY AND OUTCOMES</title><abstract>Introduction: Breast arterial calcification (BAC), detectable on mammography, has emerged as a potential risk stratification tool and surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease that comes with no a...<sep>Abstract Sterile tissue injury locally activates innate immune responses via interactions with damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Here, by analyzing ∼120K single cell transcriptomes after myocardial infarction (MI) in mice and humans, we show neutrophil and monocyte subsets induce type I interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) in myeloid progenitors of the bone marrow, far from the site of injury. In patients with acute MI, peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes express ISGs at levels far beyond healthy individuals and comparable to patients with lupus. In the bone marrow of Tet2 -/- mice, ISGs are spontaneously induced in myeloid progenitors and their progeny. In the heart, IFN responses are negatively regulated by Ccr2- resident macrophages in a Nrf2-dependent fashion. Our results show post-MI IFN signaling begins in the bone marrow, implicate multiple transcription factors in its regulation (Tet2, Irf3, Nrf2), and provide a clinical biomarker (ISG score) for studying post-MI IFN signaling in patients.<sep>Sterile tissue injury is thought to locally activate innate immune responses via damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Whether innate immune pathways are remotely activated remains relatively unexplored. Here, by analyzing ~145,000 single-cell transcriptomes at steady state and after myocardial infarction (MI) in mice and humans, we show that the type I interferon (IFN) response, characterized by expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), begins far from the site of injury, in neutrophil and monocyte progenitors within the bone marrow. In the peripheral blood of patients, we observed defined subsets of ISG-expressing neutrophils and monocytes. In the bone marrow and blood of mice, ISG expression was detected in neutrophils and monocytes and their progenitors, intensified with maturation at steady-state and after MI, and was controlled by Tet2 and Irf3 transcriptional regulators. Within the infarcted heart, ISG-expressing cells were negatively regulated by Nrf2 activation in Ccr2- steady-state cardiac macrophages. Our results show that IFN signaling begins in the bone marrow, implicate multiple transcriptional regulators (Tet2, Irf3, and Nrf2) in governing ISG expression, and provide a clinical biomarker (ISG score) for studying IFN signaling in patients.<sep>The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a central contributor to human acute and chronic liver disease, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which its activation precipitates injury remain incompletely understood. Here, we present single cell transcriptomic profiling of livers from a global transgenic tamoxifen-inducible constitutively activated Nlrp3A350V mutant mouse, and we investigate the changes in parenchymal and nonparenchymal liver cell gene expression that accompany inflammation and fibrosis.Our results demonstrate that NLRP3 activation causes chronic extramedullary myelopoiesis marked by myeloid progenitors that differentiate into proinflammatory neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. We observed prominent neutrophil infiltrates with increased Ly6gHI and Ly6gINT cells exhibiting transcriptomic signatures of granulopoiesis typically found in the bone marrow. This was accompanied by a marked increase in Ly6cHI monocytes differentiating into monocyte-derived macrophages that express transcriptional programs similar to macrophages of NASH models. NLRP3 activation also down-regulated metabolic pathways in hepatocytes and shifted hepatic stellate cells toward an activated profibrotic state based on expression of collagen and extracellular matrix regulatory genes.These results define the single cell transcriptomes underlying hepatic inflammation and fibrosis precipitated by NLRP3 activation. Clinically, our data support the notion that NLRP3-induced mechanisms should be explored as therapeutic target in NASH-like inflammation.<sep>Abstract The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a central contributor to human acute and chronic liver disease, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which its activation precipitates injury remain incompletely understood. Here, we present single cell transcriptomic profiling of livers from a global transgenic Tamoxifen-inducible constitutively-activated Nlrp3 A350V mutant mouse, and we investigate the changes in parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cell gene expression that accompany inflammation and fibrosis. Our results demonstrate that NLRP3 activation causes chronic extramedullary myelopoiesis marked by an increase in proliferating myeloid progenitors that differentiate into neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages, results that were corroborated by flow cytometry and histological staining. We observed prominent neutrophil infiltrates with increased Ly6g HI and Ly6g INT cells exhibiting transcriptomic signatures of granulopoiesis typically found in the bone marrow. This was accompanied by a marked increase in Ly6c HI monocytes differentiating into Cd11b HI Tim4 HI Clec4f HI macrophages that express proinflammatory transcriptional programs similar to macrophages of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) models. NLRP3 activation also downregulated metabolic pathways in hepatocytes and shifted hepatic stellate cells towards an activated pro-fibrotic state based on expression of collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulatory genes. These results, which highlight abundant neutrophils and extramedullary granulopoiesis define an inflamed and fibrotic hepatic single cell microenvironment, precipitated solely by NLRP3 activation. Clinically, our data support the notion that neutrophils and NLRP3 should be explored as therapeutic targets in NASH-like inflammation.<sep>Background Neutrophils are thought to be short-lived first responders to tissue injuries such as myocardial infarction (MI), but little is known about their diversification or dynamics. Methods and Results We permanently ligated the left anterior descending coronary arteries of mice and performed single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of >28 000 neutrophil transcriptomes isolated from the heart, peripheral blood, and bone marrow of mice on days 1 to 4 after MI or at steady-state. Unsupervised clustering of cardiac neutrophils revealed 5 major subsets, 3 of which originated in the bone marrow, including a late-emerging granulocyte expressing SiglecF, a marker classically used to define eosinophils. SiglecFHI neutrophils represented ≈25% of neutrophils on day 1 and grew to account for >50% of neutrophils by day 4 post-MI. Validation studies using quantitative polymerase chain reaction of fluorescent-activated cell sorter sorted Ly6G+SiglecFHI and Ly6G+SiglecFLO neutrophils confirmed the distinct nature of these populations. To confirm that the cells were neutrophils rather than eosinophils, we infarcted GATA-deficient mice (∆dblGATA) and observed similar quantities of infiltrating Ly6G+SiglecFHI cells despite marked reductions of conventional eosinophils. In contrast to other neutrophil subsets, Ly6G+SiglecFHI neutrophils expressed high levels of Myc-regulated genes, which are associated with longevity and are consistent with the persistence of this population on day 4 after MI. Conclusions Overall, our data provide a spatial and temporal atlas of neutrophil specialization in response to MI and reveal a dynamic proinflammatory cardiac Ly6G+SigF+(Myc+NFϰB+) neutrophil that has been overlooked because of negative selection.<sep>Methamphetamine is one of the most commonly abused illicit substances worldwide. Chronic methamphetamine abuse (MA) is associated with the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy. MA in patients with heart failure (MethHF) is increasingly reported yet poorly characterized. This was a retrospective cohort study of veterans treated at the VA Medical Center in San Diego between 2005 and 2015 with a diagnosis of HF and a history of MA. The incidence of MA each year was calculated, and clinical characteristics and outcomes of veterans with HF with and without MA were compared. Among 9,491 veterans with HF, 429 were identified as having a history of MA. Between 2006 and 2015, the incidence of MA in veterans with HF doubled from 3.44% to 6.70%. Of the 429 identified, 106 veterans had a hospitalization for HF and they were compared with veterans with HF without evidence of MA (HF). Compared with veterans with HF, veterans with MethHF were significantly younger (60.7 ± 7.3 vs 71.6 ± 11.6 years, p <0.001), with more frequent co-morbid post-traumatic stress disorder (16.8% vs 4.4%, p = 0.006), depression (28.7% vs 11.0%, p = 0.002), homelessness (27.9% vs 8.9%, p = 0.001), and unemployment (55.8% vs 30.0%, p <0.001). Despite their younger age, veterans with MethHF had high rates of HF readmission or emergency room visit (49% vs 38% in MethHF vs HF, p = 0.34) and mortality at 6 months (27% vs 38% in MethHF vs HF, p = 0.10) compared with HF. In conclusion, MA in veterans with HF is on the rise. Certain demographic and clinical characteristics of veterans with MethHF may contribute to their poor outcomes.<sep>Introduction: Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), the leading cause of death in the world, is often initiated by myocardial infarction (MI). In mice, death typically occurs on day 4 after acute MI is induced by coronary artery ligation. At this time the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)/type I interferon (IFN) pathway is activated almost exclusively in mononuclear cells in the infarct. We have shown that the genetic or pharmacologic disruption of critical components of this innate immune pathway reduces inflammation, limits ventricular dilation and contractile dysfunction, and improves survival. Hypothesis: Treatment with the IFNAR neutralizing antibody will bias the differentiation of cardiac macrophages and in doing so establish a cardioprotective environment in the infarct. Methods: We conducted single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of mononuclear cells isolated from infarct tissue collected on day 4 after MI from mice that had been treated with an IFNAR neutralizing antibody (Ab) as well as untreated mice. Results: Analyses demonstrate the presence of 3 core cell populations in the untreated sample: monocytes expressing Plac8 and Ms4a4c , phagocytic macrophages expressing Mrc1 and Ccl8 , and reparative macrophages expressing Arg1 and Fn1 . In addition, the dramatic co-expression of related genes in response to environmental stimuli, such as secreted type I IFNs or reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulted in the formation of two more clusters of cells. One cluster was marked by the expression of interferon stimulated genes. The other was marked by the expression of an established anti-oxidant transcriptional program. Anti-interferon therapy with IFNAR Ab inhibited both the interferon stimulated genes and the anti-oxidative transcriptional program. Conclusion: We have defined the differentiation patterns of monocytes and macrophages within the infarcted heart on day 4 after MI. Treatment with the IFNAR Ab after MI alters the composition of macrophage subsets.<sep>Myocardial infarction (MI) elicits a rapid and vigorous reaction from the bone marrow hematopoietic compartment, inducing a massive efflux of myeloid first responders into the bloodstream. These cells traffic to the infarct, where they mediate cardiac remodeling and repair through inflammatory signaling and recruitment of additional immune cells to the injured myocardium. A hyperinflammatory myeloid compartment, as is produced by mutations in epigenetic regulator TET2 associated with clonal hematopoiesis, can thus drive adverse cardiac remodeling after MI and accelerate progression to heart failure. Whether loss of TET2 alters the transcriptional landscape of MI-induced myelopoiesis remains to be investigated in an unbiased fashion. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of &gt;16,000 bone marrow myeloid cells isolated from wild-type and Tet2 -/- mice after MI to characterize the emergency hematopoietic response in the presence and absence of TET2. Our data capture distinct transitional states of myeloid lineage commitment and maturation, originating from myeloid progenitors and progressing along divergent granulocytic and monocytic differentiation trajectories. Additionally, we delineate a subpopulation of interferon (IFN)-activated myeloid progenitors, monocytes, and neutrophils characterized by the concerted upregulation of various Type I IFN-stimulated genes, and find the fraction of IFN-activated cells, as well as the degree of activation, to be markedly higher in Tet2 -/- mice. We have previously described activation of this pathway after MI in mice, and demonstrated cardioprotective effects of its genetic or pharmacological inhibition. Our findings reveal heightened activation of the antiviral Type I interferon response among bone marrow myeloid cells of Tet2 -/- mice during MI-induced emergency hematopoiesis. This highlights IFN signaling as a potential candidate driver of cardiovascular pathologies (including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and heart failure) associated with TET2-mediated clonal hematopoiesis. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether Tet2 -/- mice exhibit enhanced response to blockade of Type I IFN signaling after MI, and to determine whether myeloid cells of TET2 -mutant humans are similarly activated.<sep>The efficacy of ventricular tachycardia (VT) mapping may be limited by hemodynamic instability during induced arrhythmias, reducing the ability to accurately map the critical isthmus. We developed a novel 12-lead ECG mapping algorithm using forward solution computational models to localize VT exit sites. We hypothesized that a non-invasive computational mapping system using the 12-lead ECG can help focus activation mapping of hemodynamically unstable VTs by allowing pre-induction placement of multielectrode mapping catheters near arrhythmia-sustaining substrates. Consecutive patients referred for catheter ablation of drug-refractory VT were enrolled in this IRB-approved study. In the prospective arm of this study incorporating clinical ECG mapping, VT induction was performed first. In patients with unstable VT (defined as mean arterial pressure <60mmHg during VT), cardioversion was performed and computational ECG mapping was used to localize the VT using the recorded 12-lead ECG. The multielectrode catheter was then positioned at the mapping-predicted site and limited activation mapping was attempted during VT reinduction. Ablation was then performed per standard protocol. In the retrospective arm of the study to evaluate accuracy, ECG mapping was performed on all cases in which invasive activation mapping was available. Out of 16 consecutive patients who underwent VT ablation, 7 of the 8 patients undergoing prospective ECG mapping had unstable VT. All 7 patients with unstable VT (median VT CL: 261±27ms, mean EF: 37±17%) underwent successful limited activation mapping (median LAT = -56±47ms) guided by ECG mapping. There was a 98% reduction in total VT episodes (including 69 to 2 shocks before and after ablation) during mean 4.2 month follow-up. No complications (acute heart failure, stroke, or death) occurred. For all 16 patients (mean EF: 40±20%, ICM: 50%), the mean accuracy of ECG mapping was 1.2±0.8cm when compared to invasive activation mapping. Real-time incorporation of a novel computational 12-lead ECG mapping algorithm into a VT ablation workflow appears to facilitate targeted activation mapping of hemodynamically unstable “unmappable” VT, resulting in excellent VT suppression.</abstract>", "<keyword>Ventriculomegaly<sep>Retinal detachment<sep>Emmetropia<sep>Disease<sep>Circadian rhythm<sep>Strabismus<sep>Melatonin<sep>Fibrous joint<sep>Hypoplasia<sep>Endophthalmitis<sep>Hyperintensity<sep>Fundus photography<sep>Retinopathy of prematurity<sep>Polysomnography<sep>DNA sequencing<sep>Exome sequencing<sep>Genotype<sep>Pandemic<sep>Atropine<sep>Ophthalmoscopy<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Congenital toxoplasmosis<sep>Toxoplasma gondii<sep>Intraocular pressure<sep>Actigraphy<sep>Fluorescein angiography<sep>Toxoplasmosis<sep>Ectopia lentis<sep>Glaucoma<sep>Sanger sequencing<sep>Neuroimaging<sep>Cohort study<sep>Cornea<sep>Strabismus surgery<sep>Phenotype<sep>Cohort<sep>Gene<sep>PITX2<sep>Fundus (uterus)</keyword><title>Case report: North Carolina macular dystrophy misdiagnosed as congenital ocular toxoplasmosis.<sep>Neuroimaging Findings in Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome: A Case Series<sep>Fundus fluorescein angiography imaging of retinopathy of prematurity in infants: A review<sep>Complications of Limbal Stay Sutures in Strabismus Surgery<sep>Pathogenic genetic variants identified in Australian families with paediatric cataract<sep>The phenotypic spectrum of ADAMTSL4-associated ectopia lentis: Additional cases, complications, and review of literature.<sep>Comparison of Anterior Segment Abnormalities in Individuals With FOXC1 and PITX2 Variants<sep>Delayed melatonin circadian timing, lower melatonin output, and sleep disruptions in myopic, or short-sighted, children<sep>Real‐world outcomes of low‐dose atropine therapy on myopia progression in an Australian cohort during the <scp>COVID</scp>‐19 pandemic<sep>Prevalence of<i>FOXC1</i>Variants in Individuals With a Suspected Diagnosis of Primary Congenital Glaucoma</title><abstract>This report discusses a case of North Carolina macular dystrophy (NCMD) in a 7-year-old boy initially diagnosed as congenital toxoplasmosis. Genetic testing was performed on the child and his family after the suspicion of NCMD was raised by the treating ophthalmologist. This case report highlights the similarities between congenital toxoplasmosis and NCMD.DNA was collected from the family with consent and underwent comparative genomic hybridization and Sanger sequencing.Genetic testing identified a previously reported single base substitution (chromosome 6: 99,593,111 (G>C) NC_000006.11(GRCh38):g.100040987G>C), which confirms a diagnosis of NCMD.We believe this is the first confirmed case of NCMD in Australia. This case highlights the similarities between NCMD and more commonly recognized conditions, such as ocular toxoplasmosis, and raises the question; How many other cases are misdiagnosed as ocular toxoplasmosis?<sep>Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition associated with multisystemic features including developmental anomalies of the anterior segment of the eye. Single nucleotide and copy number variants in the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) and forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) genes are associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome as well as other CNS malformations. We determined the association between Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and specific brain MR imaging neuroradiologic anomalies in cases with or without a genetic diagnosis. This case series included 8 individuals with pathogenic variants in FOXC1; 2, in PITX2; and 2 without a genetic diagnosis. The most common observation was vertebrobasilar artery dolichoectasia, with 46% prevalence. Other prevalent abnormalities included WM hyperintensities, cerebellar hypoplasia, and ventriculomegaly. Vertebrobasilar artery dolichoectasia and absent/hypoplastic olfactory bulbs were reported in >50% of individuals with FOXC1 variants compared with 0% of PITX2 variants. Notwithstanding the small sample size, neuroimaging abnormalities were more prevalent in individuals with FOXC1 variants compared those with PITX2 variants.<sep>Fluorescein angiography in retinopathy of prematurity is increasingly utilized over the past decade. The development of ultra-wide-field imaging combined with fluorescein angiography has allowed improved visualization of the peripheral retinal vasculature. Patient cooperation in the pediatric population is particularly challenging, but hand-held digital retinal photography has shown promise and can visualize the infant retina without the need for anesthesia and intravenous access. Many features of retinopathy of prematurity and its response to laser and anti-VEGF treatment can be either exclusively or better visualized on fluorescein angiography compared to indirect ophthalmoscopy or color fundus photography. Disease treatment is gradually shifting from laser photocoagulation to intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, the latter being associated with late-onset vision-threatening sequelae. The role of fluorescein angiography in retinopathy of prematurity monitoring will continue to increase with the longer follow-up required and different clinical behavior seen with anti-VEGF treatment. We highlight the utility, safety, and importance of fluorescein angiography in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of retinopathy of prematurity.<sep>Introduction: The use of limbal stay sutures is a well-established and frequently used technique to assist in intraoperative globe manipulation. As they are removed at the termination of the surgical procedure, they are presumed to be innocuous and not associated with significant postoperative complications.Methods: We describe two cases presenting to the same tertiary care center for the management of their complications post strabismus surgery, the causative factor in both cases being the stay sutures used during the surgical procedure. The clinical details of each case are discussed, followed by a literature review.Cases: Case 1 showed evidence of epithelial ingrowth into the cornea from the stay suture site. This case, previously reported by the senior author, is now described over an eight-year period, along with clinical photographs. Case 2 developed microbial keratitis and postoperative endophthalmitis with the locus at the stay suture site.Discussion: Complications of stay suture are rare but can occur, with potentially blinding sequelae. It is important to be aware of these risks and consider alternate methods of globe traction during strabismus surgery.<sep>Objective Paediatric (childhood or congenital) cataract is an opacification of the normally clear lens of the eye and has a genetic basis in at least 18% of cases in Australia. This study aimed to replicate clinical gene screening to identify variants likely to be causative of disease in an Australian patient cohort. Methods and analysis Sixty-three reported isolated cataract genes were screened for rare coding variants in 37 Australian families using genome sequencing. Results Disease-causing variants were confirmed in eight families with variant classification as ‘likely pathogenic’. This included novel variants PITX3 p.(Ter303LeuextTer100), BFSP1 p.(Glu375GlyfsTer2), and GJA8 p.(Pro189Ser), as well as, previously described variants identified in genes GJA3, GJA8, CRYAA, BFSP1, PITX3, COL4A1 and HSF4 . Additionally, eight variants of uncertain significance with evidence towards pathogenicity were identified in genes: GJA3, GJA8, LEMD2, PRX, CRYBB1, BFSP2, and MIP . Conclusion These findings expand the genotype–phenotype correlations of both pathogenic and benign variation in cataract-associated genes. They further emphasise the need to develop additional evidence such as functional assays and variant classification criteria specific to paediatric cataract genes to improve interpretation of variants and molecular diagnosis in patients.<sep>ADAMTSL4-associated ectopia lentis is a rare autosomal recessive condition that is primarily associated with crystalline lens displacement. However, the prevalence of other ocular and systemic manifestations of this condition is poorly understood. In this study, we summarize the ocular and systemic phenotypic spectrum of this condition.A cross-sectional case study series of four individuals with biallelic pathogenic or likely pathogenic ADAMTSL4 variants was performed alongside a literature review of individuals with ADAMTSL4-associated ectopia lentis on September 29, 2021. Ocular and systemic findings, complications, and genetic findings of all four individuals were collected and summarized.The phenotypic spectrum across 91 individuals sourced from literature and four individuals from this case study series was highly variable. The main ocular phenotypes included ectopia lentis (95/95, 100%), ectopia lentis et pupillae (18/95, 19%), iris transillumination (13/95, 14%), iridodonesis (12/95, 13%), persistent pupillary membrane (12/95, 13%), and early-onset cataract or lens opacities (12/95, 13%). Anterior segment features other than ectopia lentis appeared to be exclusively associated with biallelic loss of function variants (p<0.001). Pupillary block glaucoma had a prevalence of 1%. Post-lensectomy complications included retinal detachment (6/41, 15%), elevated intraocular pressure (4/41, 10%), and aphakic glaucoma (1/41, 2%). Most individuals were not reported to have had systemic features (69/95, 73%).The clinical phenotype of ADAMTSL4-associated ectopia lentis was summarized and expanded. Clinicians should be aware of the varied ocular phenotype and the risks of retinal detachment, ocular hypertension, and glaucoma in the diagnosis and management of this condition.<sep>Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome encompasses a group of developmental disorders affecting the anterior chamber structures of the eye, with associated systemic features in some cases. This study aims to compare the difference in anterior segment phenotypes such as those involving the cornea, iris, lens, and anterior chamber angle between cases with disease-causing sequence variations in FOXC1 and PITX2 .This cross-sectional study involved 61 individuals, from 32 families with pathogenic FOXC1 or PITX2 variants, who were registered with the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma.The median age of the cohort was 39 years at the time of last assessment (range 3-85 years; females, 54%). Thirty-two patients had pathogenic variants in the FOXC1 gene, and 29 patients had pathogenic variants in the PITX2 gene. Corneal abnormalities were more common in individuals with FOXC1 variants (18/36, 50%) than those with PITX2 variants (4/25, 16%; P = 0.007). Iris abnormalities such as hypoplasia ( P = 0.008) and pseudopolycoria ( P = 0.001) were more common in individuals with PITX2 variants than those with FOXC1 variants. Glaucoma was present in 72% of participants. Corneal decompensation was positively associated with corneal abnormalities ( P < 0.001), glaucoma surgery ( P = 0.025), and cataract surgery ( P = 0.002).Corneal abnormalities were more common in individuals with FOXC1 than in those with PITX2 variants and were often associated with early onset glaucoma. These findings highlight that patients with FOXC1 variations require close follow-up and monitoring throughout infancy and into adulthood.<sep>Abstract Study Objectives This study investigated the differences in melatonin circadian timing and output, sleep characteristics, and cognitive function in myopic and non-myopic (or emmetropic) children, aged 8–15 years. Methods Twenty-six myopes (refractive error [mean ± standard error mean] −2.06 ± 0.23 diopters) and 19 emmetropes (−0.06 ± 0.04 diopters), aged 11.74 ± 2.31 years were recruited. Circadian timing was assessed using salivary dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), collected half-hourly for 7 hours, beginning 5 hours before and finishing 2 hours after individual average sleep onset in a sleep laboratory. Nocturnal melatonin output was assessed via aMT6s levels from urine voids collected from 05:30 pm to 8:00 am the following morning. Actigraphy-derived objective sleep timing were acquired for a week prior to the sleep laboratory visit. Cognitive assessments of sustained attention (using psychomotor vigilance task [PVT]) and working memory (using digit spans) were performed on the night of sleep laboratory. Results Myopic children (9:07 pm ± 14 minutes) exhibited a DLMO phase-delay of 1 hour 8 minutes compared to emmetropes (7:59 pm ± 13 minutes), p = 0.002. aMT6s melatonin levels were significantly lower among myopes (18.70 ± 2.38) than emmetropes (32.35 ± 6.93, p = 0.001). Myopes also exhibited significantly delayed sleep onset, delayed wake-up time, poor and reduced sleep, and more evening-type diurnal preference than emmetropes (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). Finally, myopes showed a slower reaction time in the PVT (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but not digit span tasks at night. Conclusions These findings suggest a potential association between circadian rhythm dysfunction and myopia in children.<sep>Abstract Background To report the outcomes of low‐dose atropine (0.01% and 0.05%) for preventing myopia progression in a real‐world Australian cohort during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Methods Records of children presenting with myopia, from January 2016 to 2022, were retrospectively reviewed at a comprehensive ophthalmic practice. Children who discontinued treatment, ages &gt;18, and cases with hereditary conditions were excluded. The rate of progression of myopia after treatment with atropine was compared with historical data to evaluate the effectiveness of the regime. Results One hundred and one children (mean baseline spherical equivalent [SphE] [−3.70 +/− 2.09 D] and axial length [AL] [24.59 +/− 1.00 mm]) were analysed. The mean age of the children was 10.4 +/− 2.89 years and 61% were females. The average follow‐up time was 17.9 +/− 12.5 months. The mean rate of progression of AL and SphE on 0.01% atropine eyedrops was 0.219 +/− 0.35 mm and − 0.250 +/− 0.86 D/year, respectively. 68.1% of the children treated with 0.01% atropine were mild progressors (&lt;0.5 D change/year). Non‐responders when commenced on a higher dose of atropine (0.05%) experienced a 93% ( p = 0.012) and 30% reduction in SphE and AL growth rate, respectively. Family history, higher myopia or younger age at baseline and shorter duration of treatment were associated with steeper progression ( p &lt; 0.01). Both doses were well tolerated. Conclusions Low‐dose atropine was shown to be beneficial in a real‐world clinical setting, despite interruptions to follow‐ups secondary to COVID‐19 pandemic. A 0.05% dose of atropine may be effective in cases where 0.01% was ineffective.<sep>Both primary and secondary forms of childhood glaucoma have many distinct causative mechanisms, and in many cases a cause is not immediately clear. The broad phenotypic spectrum of secondary glaucoma, particularly in individuals with variants in FOXC1 or PITX2 genes associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, makes it more difficult to diagnose patients with milder phenotypes. These cases are occasionally classified and managed as primary congenital glaucoma.To investigate the prevalence of FOXC1 variants in participants with a suspected diagnosis of primary congenital glaucoma.Australian and Italian cohorts were recruited from January 1, 2007, through March 1, 2016. Australian individuals were recruited through the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma and Italian individuals through the Genetic and Ophthalmology Unit of l'Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda in Milan, Italy. We performed exome sequencing, in combination with Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, to detect variants of FOXC1 in individuals with a suspected diagnosis of primary congenital glaucoma established by their treating specialist. Data analysis was completed from June 2015 to November 2017.Identification of single-nucleotide and copy number variants in FOXC1, along with phenotypic characterization of the individuals who carried them.A total of 131 individuals with a suspected diagnosis of primary congenital glaucoma were included. The mean (SD) age at recruitment in the Australian cohort was 24.3 (18.1) years; 37 of 84 Australian participants (44.0%) were female, and 71 of 84 (84.5%) were of European ancestry. The mean (SD) age at recruitment was 22.5 (18.4) years in the Italian cohort; 21 of 47 Italian participants (44.7%) were female, and 45 of 47 (95.7%) were of European ancestry. We observed rare, predicted deleterious FOXC1 variants in 8 of 131 participants (6.1%), or 8 of 166 participants (4.8%) when including those explained by variants in CYP1B1. On reexamination or reinvestigation, all of these individuals had at least 1 detectable ocular and/or systemic feature associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.These data highlight the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of childhood glaucoma and support the use of gene panels incorporating FOXC1 as a diagnostic aid, especially because clinical features of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome can be subtle. Further replication of these results will be needed to support the future use of such panels.</abstract>", "<keyword>Progressive supranuclear palsy<sep>Major histocompatibility complex<sep>GSK3B<sep>Pipeline transport<sep>GABAergic<sep>Disease<sep>Curse of dimensionality<sep>Glial fibrillary acidic protein<sep>Parvalbumin<sep>Neuroinflammation<sep>Prefrontal cortex<sep>Epigenetics<sep>Statistical analysis<sep>Parkinson's disease<sep>Dementia<sep>Neurodegeneration<sep>Label-free quantification<sep>Software<sep>Quantitative proteomics<sep>Synucleinopathies<sep>Window (computing)<sep>Synaptic pruning<sep>Antibody<sep>Immunohistochemistry<sep>GSK-3<sep>Pathogenesis<sep>Avidity<sep>Proteomics<sep>Cerebrospinal fluid<sep>DNA methylation<sep>Pipeline (software)<sep>Calretinin<sep>Autoantibody<sep>Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)<sep>Suite<sep>CD14<sep>Sample (material)<sep>Sample size determination<sep>Atrophy<sep>Preprocessor<sep>Proteome<sep>Synaptic plasticity<sep>Layer (electronics)<sep>Oxidative stress<sep>Transcriptome<sep>Visualization<sep>Gene<sep>Signal transduction</keyword><title>Author Correction: Assessment of brain reference genes for RT-qPCR studies in neurodegenerative diseases<sep>CRMetrics - an R package for Cell Ranger Filtering and Metrics Visualisation<sep>Case-control analysis of single-cell RNA-seq studies<sep>Upper cortical layer–driven network impairment in schizophrenia<sep>Ultra-fast label-free quantification and comprehensive proteome coverage with narrow-window data-independent acquisition<sep>Increased prefrontal cortex interleukin-2 protein levels and shift in the peripheral T cell population in progressive supranuclear palsy patients<sep>Selective vulnerability of supragranular layer neurons in schizophrenia<sep>Distinct Autoimmune Anti-α-Synuclein Antibody Patterns in Multiple System Atrophy and Parkinson’s Disease<sep>PIAS2-mediated blockade of IFN-β signaling: a basis for sporadic Parkinson disease dementia<sep>Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma distribution of anti-α-synuclein IgMs and IgGs in multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease<sep>Epigenetic modulation of AREL1 and increased HLA expression in brains of multiple system atrophy patients<sep>A maturational shift in the frontal cortex synaptic transcriptional landscape underlies schizophrenia-relevant behavioural traits: A congenital rat model<sep>Brain proteome profiling implicates the complement and coagulation cascade in multiple system atrophy brain pathology</title><abstract>An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.<sep>Abstract Several pipelines exist for analysis of single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (sxRNA-seq) data in multiple programming languages. Although filtering and quality control (QC) of data as preprocessing steps are included in several analytical pipelines, visual assessment of filtered cells is often lacking. Here, we present a streamlined pipeline for filtering of sxRNA-seq data and visualisation of every filtering step using existing software packages. This includes methods to remove ambient RNA, doublets, cells with a high fraction of mitochondrial genes expressed, and cells with low sequencing depth that are difficult to cluster and annotate. All steps are accompanied by plotting functions to ease the selection of thresholds for these crucial steps in data preprocessing.<sep>Summary Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) assays are being increasingly utilized to investigate specific hypotheses in both basic biology and clinically-applied studies. The design of most such studies can be often reduced to a comparison between two or more groups of samples, such as disease cases and healthy controls, or treatment and placebo. Comparative analysis between groups of scRNA-seq samples brings additional statistical considerations, and currently there is a lack of tools to address this common scenario. Based on our experience with comparative designs, here we present a computational suite ( Cacoa – ca se- co ntrol a nalysis ) to carry out statistical tests, exploration, and visualization of scRNA-seq sample cohorts. Using multiple example datasets, we demonstrate how application of these techniques can provide additional insights, and avoid issues stemming from inter-individual variability, limited sample size, and high dimensionality of the data.<sep>Schizophrenia is one of the most widespread and complex mental disorders. To characterize the impact of schizophrenia, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of &gt;220,000 neurons from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia and matched controls. In addition, &gt;115,000 neurons were analyzed topographically by immunohistochemistry. Compositional analysis of snRNA-seq data revealed a reduction in abundance of GABAergic neurons and a concomitant increase in principal neurons, most pronounced for upper cortical layer subtypes, which was substantiated by histological analysis. Many neuronal subtypes showed extensive transcriptomic changes, the most marked in upper-layer GABAergic neurons, including down-regulation in energy metabolism and up-regulation in neurotransmission. Transcription factor network analysis demonstrated a developmental origin of transcriptomic changes. Last, Visium spatial transcriptomics further corroborated upper-layer neuron vulnerability in schizophrenia. Overall, our results point toward general network impairment within upper cortical layers as a core substrate associated with schizophrenia symptomatology.<sep>Abstract Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics aims to characterize comprehensive proteomes in a fast and reproducible manner. Here we present the narrow-window data-independent acquisition (nDIA) strategy consisting of high-resolution MS1 scans with parallel tandem MS (MS/MS) scans of ~200 Hz using 2-Th isolation windows, dissolving the differences between data-dependent and -independent methods. This is achieved by pairing a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer with the asymmetric track lossless (Astral) analyzer which provides &gt;200-Hz MS/MS scanning speed, high resolving power and sensitivity, and low-ppm mass accuracy. The nDIA strategy enables profiling of &gt;100 full yeast proteomes per day, or 48 human proteomes per day at the depth of ~10,000 human protein groups in half-an-hour or ~7,000 proteins in 5 min, representing 3× higher coverage compared with current state-of-the-art MS. Multi-shot acquisition of offline fractionated samples provides comprehensive coverage of human proteomes in ~3 h. High quantitative precision and accuracy are demonstrated in a three-species proteome mixture, quantifying 14,000+ protein groups in a single half-an-hour run.<sep>Abstract Accumulating evidence suggests neuroinflammation to be an integrated feature of neurodegeneration. Profiling inflammatory mediators across diseases may reveal common and disease-specific signatures. Here, we focused on progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a tauopathy presenting motor and cognitive dysfunction. We screened for 21 cytokines and growth factors in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of 16 PSP and 16 control brains using different quantitative techniques. We found and validated increased interleukin (IL)-2 protein levels in the PSP group expressed locally by neurons and glia cells. We further investigated central players in neuroinflammatory pathways and found increased mRNA expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta ( GSK3B ). IL-2 and GSK3B proteins are T and natural killer (NK) cell regulators and have previously been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy. In addition, we identified a shift in peripheral CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations toward increased numbers of memory and reduced numbers of naive T cells. We also observed increased numbers of CD56 + NK cells, but not of CD56 + CD57 + or CD57 + NK cells. Our findings suggest a role for IL-2 in PSP disease processes and point toward active and possibly dysfunctional peripheral immune responses in these patients.<sep>ABSTRACT Schizophrenia is one of the most wide-spread mental brain disorders with complex and largely unknown etiology. To characterize the impact of schizophrenia at a cellular level, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing of &gt;190,000 neurons from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia and matched controls (7 vs 11, respectively). In addition, to correlate data with cortical anatomy, &gt;100,000 neurons were analyzed topographically by immunohistochemistry in an extended cohort of cases with schizophrenia and controls (10 vs 10). Compositional analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed reduction in relative abundance across all families of GABAergic neurons and a concomitant increase in principal neurons, which was most pronounced for supragranular subtypes (layers 2-3). Moreover, supragranular subtypes of GABAergic interneurons showed most dramatic transcriptomic changes. These results were substantiated by histological analysis, which revealed a reduction in the density of calretinin, calbindin and parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons particularly in layer 2. Common effect of schizophrenia on supragranular neuronal networks was underlined by downregulation of protein processing genes and upregulation of neuronal development/plasticity genes across supragranular subtypes of principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons. In situ hybridization and spatial transcriptomics further confirmed supragranular layer neuron vulnerability, revealing complexity of schizophrenia-affected cortical circuits. These point towards general network impairment within supragranular layers being a core substrate associated with schizophrenia symptomatology.<sep>Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is considered to be the major pathological hallmark and driving force of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Immune dysfunctions have been associated with both MSA and PD and recently we reported that the levels of natural occurring autoantibodies (NAbs) with high affinity towards α-synuclein are reduced in MSA and PD patients. Here, we aimed to evaluate the plasma immunoglobulin (Ig) composition binding α-syn and other amyloidogenic neuropathological proteins, and to correlate them with disease severity and duration in MSA and PD patients. All participants were recruited from a single neurological unit and the plasma samples were stored for later research at the Bispebjerg Movement Disorder Biobank. All patients were diagnosed according to current consensus criteria. Using multiple variable linear regression analyses, we observed higher levels of anti-α-syn IgG1 and IgG3 NAbs in MSA versus PD, higher levels of anti-α-syn IgG2 NAbs in PD compared to controls, whereas anti-α-syn IgG4 NAbs were reduced in PD compared to MSA and controls. Anti-α-syn IgM levels were decreased in both MSA and PD. Further our data supported that MSA patients’ immune system was affected with reduced IgG1 and IgM global levels compared to PD and controls, with further reduced global IgG2 levels compared to PD. These results suggest distinct autoimmune patterns in MSA and PD. These findings suggest a specific autoimmune physiological mechanism involving responses towards α-syn, differing in neurodegenerative disease with overlapping α-syn pathology.<sep>Familial Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with rare genetic mutations, but the etiology in most patients with sporadic (s)PD is largely unknown, and the basis for its progression to dementia (sPDD) is poorly characterized. We have identified that loss of IFNβ or IFNAR1, the receptor for IFNα/β, causes pathological and behavioral changes resembling PDD, prompting us to hypothesize that dysregulated genes in IFNβ-IFNAR signaling pathway predispose one to sPD. By transcriptomic analysis, we found defective neuronal IFNβ-IFNAR signaling, including particularly elevated PIAS2 associated with sPDD. With meta-analysis of GWASs, we identified sequence variants in IFNβ-IFNAR-related genes in sPD patients. Furthermore, sPDD patients expressed higher levels of PIAS2 mRNA and protein in neurons. To determine its function in brain, we overexpressed PIAS2 under a neuronal promoter, alone or with human α-synuclein, in the brains of mice, which caused motor and cognitive impairments and correlated with intraneuronal phosphorylated (p)α-synuclein accumulation and dopaminergic neuron loss. Ectopic expression of neuronal PIAS2 blocked mitophagy, increased the accumulation of senescent mitochondrial and oxidative stress, as evidenced by excessive oxDJ1 and 8OHdG, by inactivating ERK1/2-P53 signaling. Conversely, PIAS2 knockdown rescued the clinicopathological manifestations of PDD in Ifnb-/- mice on restoring mitochondrial homeostasis, oxidative stress, and pERK1/2-pP53 signaling. The regulation of JAK-STAT2-PIAS2 signaling was crucial for neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival and excitability and thus might prevent cognitive impairments. Our findings provide insights into the progression of sPD and dementia and have implications for new therapeutic approaches.<sep>Ubiquitous naturally occurring autoantibodies (nAbs) against alpha-synuclein (α-syn) may play important roles in the pathogenesis of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, we reported reduced high-affinity/avidity anti-α-syn nAbs levels in plasma from MSA and PD patients, along with distinct inter-group immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass distributions. The extent to which these observations in plasma may reflect corresponding levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is unknown.Using competitive and indirect ELISAs, we investigated the affinity/avidity of CSF anti-α-syn nAbs as well as the CSF and plasma distribution of IgG subclasses and IgM nAbs in a cross-sectional cohort of MSA and PD patients.Repertoires of high-affinity/avidity anti-α-syn IgG nAbs were reduced in CSF samples from MSA and PD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, anti-α-syn IgM nAb levels were relatively lower in CSF and plasma from MSA patients but were reduced only in plasma from PD patients. Interestingly, anti-α-syn IgG subclasses presented disease-specific profiles both in CSF and plasma. Anti-α-syn IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 levels were relatively increased in CSF of MSA patients, whereas PD patients showed increased anti-α-syn IgG2 and reduced anti-α-syn IgG4 levels.Differences in the plasma/CSF distribution of anti-α-syn nAbs seem to be a common feature of synucleinopathies. Our data add further support to the notion that MSA and PD patients may have compromised immune reactivity towards α-syn. The differing α-syn-specific systemic immunological responses may reflect their specific disease pathophysiologies. These results are encouraging for further investigation of these immunological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.<sep>Abstract Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare disease with a fatal outcome. To date, little is known about the molecular processes underlying disease development. Its clinical overlap with related neurodegenerative movement disorders underlines the importance for expanding the knowledge of pathological brain processes in MSA patients to improve distinction from similar diseases. In the current study, we investigated DNA methylation changes in brain samples from 41 MSA patients and 37 healthy controls. We focused on the prefrontal cortex, a moderately affected area in MSA. Using Illumina MethylationEPIC arrays, we investigated 5-methylcytosine (5mC) as well as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) changes throughout the genome. We identified five significantly different 5mC probes (adj. P &lt; 0.05), of which one probe mapping to the AREL1 gene involved in antigen presentation was decreased in MSA patients. This decrease correlated with increased 5hmC levels. Further, we identified functional DNA methylation modules involved in inflammatory processes. As expected, the decreased 5mC levels on AREL1 was concordant with increased gene expression levels of both AREL1 as well as MHC Class I HLA genes in MSA brains. We also investigated whether these changes in antigen-related processes in the brain associated with changes in peripheral mononuclear cells. Using flow cytometry on an independent cohort of MSA patients, we identified a decrease in circulating non-classical CD14 + CD16 ++ blood monocytes, whereas T and NK cell populations were unchanged. Taken together, our results support the view of an active neuroimmune response in brains of MSA patients.<sep>Disruption of brain development early in life may underlie the neurobiology behind schizophrenia. We have reported more immature synaptic spines in the frontal cortex (FC) of adult Roman High-Avoidance (RHA-I) rats, a behavioural model displaying schizophrenia-like traits. Here, we performed a whole transcriptome analysis in the FC of 4 months old male RHA-I (n=8) and its counterpart, the Roman Low-Avoidance (RLA-I) (n=8). We identified 203 significant genes with overrepresentation of genes involved in synaptic function. Next, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for genes co-expressed during neurodevelopment. Gene networks were obtained by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of a transcriptomic dataset containing human FC during lifespan (n=269). Out of thirty-one functional gene networks, six were significantly enriched in the RHA-I. These were differentially regulated during infancy and enriched in biological ontologies related to myelination, synaptic function, and immune response. We validated differential gene expression in a new cohort of adolescent (<=2 months old) and young-adult (>=3 months old) RHA-I and RLA-I rats. The results confirmed overexpression of Gsn, Nt5cd1, Ppp1r1b, and Slc9a3r1 in young-adult RHA-I, while Cables1, a regulator of Cdk5 phosphorylation in actin regulation and involved in synaptic plasticity and maturation, was significantly downregulated in adolescent RHA-I. This age-related expression change was also observed for presynaptic components Snap25 and Snap29. Our results show a different maturational expression profile of synaptic components in the RHA-I strain, supporting a shift in FC maturation underlying schizophrenia-like behavioural traits and adding construct validity to this strain as a neurodevelopmental model.<sep>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder presenting glia pathology. Still, disease etiology and pathophysiology are unknown, but neuro-inflammation and vascular disruption may be contributing factors to the disease progression. Here, we performed an ex vivo deep proteome profiling of the prefrontal cortex of MSA patients to reveal disease-relevant molecular neuropathological processes. Observations were validated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of novel cross-sectional patient cohorts.Brains from 45 MSA patients and 30 normal controls (CTRLs) were included. Brain samples were homogenized and trypsinized for peptide formation and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results were supplemented by western blotting, immuno-capture, tissue clearing and 3D imaging, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Subsequent measurements of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and neuro-filament light chain (NFL) levels were performed by immunoblotting in plasma of 20 MSA patients and 20 CTRLs. Finally, we performed a proteome profiling of 144 CSF samples from MSA and CTRLs, as well as other parkinsonian disorders. Data were analyzed using relevant parametric and non-parametric two-sample tests or linear regression tests followed by post hoc tests corrected for multiple testing. Additionally, high-throughput bioinformatic analyses were applied.We quantified more than 4,000 proteins across samples and identified 49 differentially expressed proteins with significantly different abundances in MSA patients compared with CTRLs. Pathway analyses showed enrichment of processes related to fibrinolysis and complement cascade activation. Increased fibrinogen subunit β (FGB) protein levels were further verified, and we identified an enriched recognition of FGB by IgGs as well as intra-parenchymal accumulation around blood vessels. We corroborated blood-brain barrier leakage by a significant increase in GFAP and NFL plasma levels in MSA patients that correlated to disease severity and/or duration. Proteome profiling of CSF samples acquired during the disease course, confirmed increased total fibrinogen levels and immune-related components in the soluble fraction of MSA patients. This was also true for the other atypical parkinsonian disorders, dementia with Lewy bodies and progressive supra-nuclear palsy, but not for Parkinson's disease patients.Our results implicate activation of the fibrinolytic cascade and immune system in the brain as contributing factors in MSA associated with a more severe disease course.</abstract>", "<keyword>Convection<sep>Scalar (mathematics)<sep>Logarithm<sep>Latent heat<sep>Geostrophic wind<sep>Isothermal process<sep>Temperature gradient<sep>Solver<sep>Flux (metallurgy)<sep>Atmosphere (unit)<sep>Energy (signal processing)<sep>Energy flux<sep>Plane (geometry)<sep>Polynomial chaos<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Thermal<sep>Tropical cyclone<sep>Polynomial<sep>Shallow water equations<sep>Upwind scheme<sep>Matrix (chemical analysis)<sep>Vortex</keyword><title>Interaction of tropical cyclone-like vortices with sea-surface temperature anomalies and topography in a simple shallow-water atmospheric model<sep>Thermal versus isothermal rotating shallow water equations: comparison of dynamical processes by simulations with a novel well-balanced central-upwind scheme<sep>Moist-convective thermal rotating shallow water model<sep>Flux Globalization Based Well-Balanced Central-Upwind Schemes for Hydrodynamic Equations with General Free Energy<sep>Data-driven polynomial chaos expansions: A weighted least-square approximation</title><abstract>In this paper, we show how the thermal effects affect trajectories, intensity, and formation of secondary structures during the passages of strong tropical cyclone-like vortices over oceanic warm and cold pools as well as over an island-type topography. Our results are obtained using the moist-convective thermal rotating shallow-water atmospheric model recently developed in [A. Kurganov et al., “Moist-convective thermal rotating shallow-water model,” Phys. Fluids 32, 066601 (2020)]. This model introduces thermodynamics of the moist air and moist convection in the standard rotating shallow-water models and allows to include in the latter atmosphere–ocean interactions in an elementary way.<sep>We introduce a new high-resolution well-balanced central-upwind scheme for two-dimensional rotating shallow water equations with horizontal temperature/density gradients – thermal rotating shallow water equations. The scheme maintains the equilibrium states in the presence of topography and temperature/density variations, and allows for high-resolution tracking of the active scalar field together with velocity and pressure fields. We use the new scheme to highlight both the similarities and differences in the predictions of the thermal and isothermal shallow water models for the fundamental dynamical processes: evolution of isolated vortices in the midlatitude β-plane in the presence of topography and relaxation of localised pressure and temperature perturbations in the equatorial β-plane.<sep>We show how the moist-convective rotating shallow water model, where the moist convection and the related latent heat release are incorporated into the standard rotating shallow water model of the atmosphere, can be improved by introducing, in a self-consistent way, horizontal gradients of potential temperature and changes of the latter due to the condensation heating, radiative cooling, and ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes. We also construct the quasi-geostrophic limit of the model in mid-latitudes and its weak-gradient limits in the equatorial region. The capabilities of the new model are illustrated by the examples of convection-coupled gravity waves and equatorial waves produced by the relaxation of localized pressure and potential temperature anomalies in the presence of moist convection.<sep>Abstract We develop flux globalization based well-balanced central-upwind schemes for hydrodynamic equations with general free energy. The proposed schemes are well-balanced in the sense that they are capable of exactly preserving quite complicated steady-state solutions and also exactly capturing traveling waves, even when vacuum regions are present. In order to accurately track interfaces of the vacuum regions and near vacuum parts of the solution, we use the technique introduced in Chertock et al. (J Sci Comput 90:Paper No. 9, 2022) and design a hybrid approach: inside the no vacuum regions, we use the flux globalization based well-balanced central-upwind scheme, while elsewhere we implement the central-upwind scheme similar to the one proposed in Bollermann et al. (J Sci Comput 56:267–290, 2013) in the context of wet/dry fronts in the shallow water equations. The advantages of the proposed schemes are demonstrated on a number of challenging numerical examples.<sep>In this work, we combine the idea of data-driven polynomial chaos expansions with the weighted least-square approach to solve uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems. The idea of data-driven polynomial chaos is to use statistical moments of the input random variables to develop an arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion, and then use such data-driven bases to perform UQ computations. Here we adopt the bases construction procedure by following \\cite{Ahlfeld_2016SAMBA}, where the bases are computed by using matrix operations on the Hankel matrix of moments. Different from previous works, in the postprocessing part, we propose a weighted least-squares approach to solve UQ problems. This approach includes a sampling strategy and a least-squares solver. The main features of our approach are two folds: On one hand, our sampling strategy is independent of the random input. More precisely, we propose to sampling with the equilibrium measure, and this measure is also independent of the data-driven bases. Thus, this procedure can be done in prior (or in a off-line manner). On the other hand, we propose to solve a Christoffel function weighted least-square problem, and this strategy is quasi-linearly stable -- the required number of PDE solvers depends linearly (up to a logarithmic factor) on the number of (data-driven) bases. This new approach is thus promising in dealing with a class of problems with epistemic uncertainties. Several numerical tests are presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.</abstract>", "<keyword>Inositol phosphate<sep>Frontotemporal dementia<sep>C9orf72<sep>Trinucleotide repeat expansion<sep>Autophagy<sep>Dictyostelium discoideum<sep>Neurodegeneration<sep>Dictyostelium<sep>mTORC1<sep>Inositol<sep>Mechanism (biology)<sep>ATG8<sep>Polyphosphate<sep>Decanoic acid<sep>Ketone bodies<sep>Labelling<sep>PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Ketogenic diet<sep>Translation (biology)<sep>Dravet syndrome<sep>Nicastrin<sep>Phosphate<sep>Methionine<sep>Fluorescence<sep>Cannabidiol<sep>Presenilin<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Signal transduction</keyword><title>A Dictyostelium discoideum mitochondrial fluorescent tagging vector that does not affect respiratory function<sep>Decanoic acid inhibits mTORC1 activity independent of glucose and insulin signaling<sep>A C. elegans model of C9orf72-associated ALS/FTD uncovers a conserved role for eIF2D in RAN translation<sep>Decanoic Acid Stimulates Autophagy in D. discoideum<sep>A new mechanism for cannabidiol in regulating the one‐carbon cycle and methionine levels in <scp><i>Dictyostelium</i></scp> and in mammalian epilepsy models<sep>Gamma secretase orthologs are required for lysosomal activity and autophagic degradation in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, independent of PSEN (presenilin) proteolytic function<sep>Phytocannabinoid‐dependent mTORC1 regulation is dependent upon inositol polyphosphate multikinase activity</title><abstract>Visualizing mitochondria in living Dictyostelium discoideum cells using fluorescent dyes is often problematic due to variability in staining, metabolism of the dyes, and unknown potential effects of the dyes on mitochondrial function.

We also show that this labelling has no effect upon mitochondria load or respiratory function.<sep>Significance The mTORC1 complex provides a critical role in cell function, regulating a variety of processes including growth and autophagy. mTORC1 signaling is hyperactivated in a range of common diseases including cancer, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, mTORC1 signaling provides an important target for regulation in many contexts. Here, we show that decanoic acid, a key component of a widely used medicinal diet, reduces mTORC1 activity. We identify this in a tractable model system, and validate it in ex vivo rat brain tissue and in human iPSC-derived astrocytes from patients with a clinically relevant disease. Thus, we provide insight into an easily accessible therapeutic approach for a range of diseases.<sep>A hexanucleotide repeat expansion GGGGCC in the non-coding region of C9orf72 is the most common cause of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Toxic dipeptide repeats (DPRs) are synthesized from GGGGCC via repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Here, we develop C. elegans models that express, either ubiquitously or exclusively in neurons, 75 GGGGCC repeats flanked by intronic C9orf72 sequence. The worms generate DPRs (poly-glycine-alanine [poly-GA], poly-glycine-proline [poly-GP]) and poly-glycine-arginine [poly-GR]), display neurodegeneration, and exhibit locomotor and lifespan defects. Mutation of a non-canonical translation-initiating codon (CUG) upstream of the repeats selectively reduces poly-GA steady-state levels and ameliorates disease, suggesting poly-GA is pathogenic. Importantly, loss-of-function mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D (eif-2D/eIF2D) reduce poly-GA and poly-GP levels, and increase lifespan in both C. elegans models. Our in vitro studies in mammalian cells yield similar results. Here, we show a conserved role for eif-2D/eIF2D in DPR expression.<sep>Ketogenic diets, used in epilepsy treatment, are considered to work through reduced glucose and ketone generation to regulate a range of cellular process including autophagy induction. Recent studies into the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet have suggested that medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) provided in the diet, decanoic acid and octanoic acid, cause specific therapeutic effects independent of glucose reduction, although a role in autophagy has not been investigated. Both autophagy and MCFAs have been widely studied in Dictyostelium, with findings providing important advances in the study of autophagy-related pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we utilize this model to analyze a role for MCFAs in regulating autophagy. We show that treatment with decanoic acid but not octanoic acid induces autophagosome formation and modulates autophagic flux in high glucose conditions. To investigate this effect, decanoic acid, but not octanoic acid, was found to induce the expression of autophagy-inducing proteins (Atg1 and Atg8), providing a mechanism for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate a range of related fatty acid derivatives with seizure control activity, 4BCCA, 4EOA, and Epilim (valproic acid), also function to induce autophagosome formation in this model. Thus, our data suggest that decanoic acid and related compounds may provide a less-restrictive therapeutic approach to activate autophagy.<sep>Background and Purpose Epidiolex™, a form of highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) derived from Cannabis plants, has demonstrated seizure control activity in patients with Dravet syndrome, without a fully elucidated mechanism of action. We have employed an unbiased approach to investigate this mechanism at a cellular level. Experimental Approach We use a tractable biomedical model organism, Dictyostelium , to identify a protein controlling the effect of CBD and characterize this mechanism. We then translate these results to a Dravet syndrome mouse model and an acute in vitro seizure model. Key Results CBD activity is partially dependent upon the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system component, GcvH1 in Dictyostelium , orthologous to the human glycine cleavage system component H protein, which is functionally linked to folate one‐carbon metabolism (FOCM). Analysis of FOCM components identified a mechanism for CBD in directly inhibiting methionine synthesis. Analysis of brain tissue from a Dravet syndrome mouse model also showed drastically altered levels of one‐carbon components including methionine, and an in vitro rat seizure model showed an elevated level of methionine that is attenuated following CBD treatment. Conclusions and Implications Our results suggest a novel mechanism for CBD in the regulating methionine levels and identify altered one‐carbon metabolism in Dravet syndrome and seizure activity.<sep>Mutations in the γ-secretase complex are strongly associated with familial Alzheimer disease. Both proteolytic and non-proteolytic functions for the γ-secretase complex have been previously described in mammalian model organisms, but their relative contributions to disease pathology remain unclear. Here, we dissect the roles of orthologs of the γ-secretase components in the model system Dictyostelium, focusing on endocytosis, lysosomal activity and autophagy. In this model, we show that the orthologs of PSEN (psenA and psenB), Ncstn (nicastrin) and Aph-1 (gamma-secretase subunit Aph-1), are necessary for optimal fluid-phase uptake by macropinocytosis and in multicellular development under basic pH conditions. Disruption of either psenA/B or Aph-1 proteins also leads to disrupted phagosomal proteolysis as well as decreased autophagosomal acidification and autophagic flux. This indicates a general defect in lysosomal trafficking and degradation, which we show leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in cells lacking psenA/B and Aph-1 proteins. Importantly, we find that all the endocytic defects observed in Dictyostelium PSEN ortholog mutants can be fully rescued by proteolytically inactive Dictyostelium psenB and human PSEN1 proteins. Our data therefore demonstrates an evolutionarily conserved non-proteolytic role for presenilin, and γ-secretase component orthologs, in maintaining Dictyostelium lysosomal trafficking and autophagy.

Here, we investigate the effects of phytocannabinoids on mTORC1 and define a molecular mechanism. Experimental Approach A novel mechanism for phytocannabinoids was identified using the tractable model system, Dictyostelium discoideum . Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we further validate this new mechanism of action. We demonstrate clinical relevance using cells derived from healthy individuals and from people with MS (pwMS). Key Results Both CBD and the more abundant cannabigerol (CBG) enhance mTORC1 activity in D. discoideum . We identify a mechanism for this effect involving inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), where elevated IPMK expression reverses the response to phytocannabinoids, decreasing mTORC1 activity upon treatment, providing new insight on phytocannabinoids' actions. We further validated this mechanism using mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Clinical relevance of this effect was shown in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where CBD and CBG treatment increased mTORC1 activity in cells derived from healthy individuals and decreased mTORC1 activity in cells derived from pwMS. Conclusion and Implications Our findings suggest that both CBD and the abundant CBG differentially regulate mTORC1 signalling through a mechanism dependent on the activity of the upstream IPMK signalling pathway, with potential relevance to the treatment of mTOR‐related disorders, including MS.</abstract>", "<keyword>Observational study<sep>Hypothalamus<sep>Burst suppression<sep>Delirium<sep>Circadian rhythm<sep>Resting state fMRI<sep>Psychometrics<sep>Testosterone (patch)<sep>Electroconvulsive therapy<sep>Dementia<sep>Network dynamics<sep>Grading (engineering)<sep>Intraclass correlation<sep>Unconsciousness<sep>Criticality<sep>Polysomnography<sep>Isoflurane<sep>Clinical trial<sep>Electroencephalography<sep>Perioperative<sep>Emergence delirium<sep>Postoperative nausea and vomiting<sep>Vigilance (psychology)<sep>Episodic memory<sep>Actigraphy<sep>Wakefulness<sep>Anesthetic<sep>Nausea<sep>Prospective cohort study<sep>Odds ratio<sep>Complication<sep>Randomized controlled trial<sep>Cognition<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Scalp<sep>Confusion<sep>Cognitive decline<sep>Fragmentation (computing)</keyword><title>Effect of electroencephalogram-guided anaesthesia administration on 1-yr mortality: follow-up of a randomised clinical trial<sep>Hormonal basis of sex differences in anesthetic sensitivity<sep>Duration of EEG suppression does not predict recovery time or degree of cognitive impairment after general anaesthesia in human volunteers<sep>Quiescence during burst suppression and postictal generalized EEG suppression are distinct patterns of activity<sep>Associations of environmental and lifestyle factors with spatial navigation in younger and older adults<sep>Relationship of critical dynamics, functional connectivity, and states of consciousness in large-scale human brain networks<sep>Prospective observational cohort study on grading the severity of postoperative complications in global surgery research<sep>Preoperative Cognitive Abnormality, Intraoperative Electroencephalogram Suppression, and Postoperative Delirium<sep>Evaluation of the 3-Minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method for Identification of Postoperative Delirium in Older Patients<sep>0326 Influence of Sleep and Cardiovascular Health on Cognitive Outcomes in Older Adults<sep>Perioperative Epidural Use and Risk of Delirium in Surgical Patients: A Secondary Analysis of the PODCAST Trial<sep>Effect of Electroencephalography-Guided Anesthetic Administration on Postoperative Delirium Among Older Adults Undergoing Major Surgery</title><abstract>BackgroundIntraoperative EEG suppression duration has been associated with postoperative delirium and mortality. In a clinical trial testing anaesthesia titration to avoid EEG suppression, the intervention did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium, but was associated with reduced 30-day mortality. The present study evaluated whether the EEG-guided anaesthesia intervention was also associated with reduced 1-yr mortality.MethodsThis manuscript reports 1 yr follow-up of subjects from a single-centre RCT, including a post hoc secondary outcome (1-yr mortality) in addition to pre-specified secondary outcomes. The trial included subjects aged 60 yr or older undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia between January 2015 and May 2018. Patients were randomised to receive EEG-guided anaesthesia or usual care. The previously reported primary outcome was postoperative delirium. The outcome of the current study was all-cause 1-yr mortality.ResultsOf the 1232 subjects enrolled, 614 subjects were randomised to EEG-guided anaesthesia and 618 subjects to usual care. One-year mortality was 57/591 (9.6%) in the guided group and 62/601 (10.3%) in the usual-care group. No significant difference in mortality was observed (adjusted absolute risk difference, –0.7%; 99.5% confidence interval, –5.8% to 4.3%; P=0.68).ConclusionsAn EEG-guided anaesthesia intervention aiming to decrease duration of EEG suppression during surgery did not significantly decrease 1-yr mortality. These findings, in the context of other studies, do not provide supportive evidence for EEG-guided anaesthesia to prevent intermediate term postoperative death.Clinical trial registrationNCT02241655.<sep>General anesthesia—a pharmacologically induced reversible state of unconsciousness—enables millions of life-saving procedures. Anesthetics induce unconsciousness in part by impinging upon sexually dimorphic and hormonally sensitive hypothalamic circuits regulating sleep and wakefulness. Thus, we hypothesized that anesthetic sensitivity should be sex-dependent and modulated by sex hormones. Using distinct behavioral measures, we show that at identical brain anesthetic concentrations, female mice are more resistant to volatile anesthetics than males. Anesthetic sensitivity is bidirectionally modulated by testosterone. Castration increases anesthetic resistance. Conversely, testosterone administration acutely increases anesthetic sensitivity. Conversion of testosterone to estradiol by aromatase is partially responsible for this effect. In contrast, oophorectomy has no effect. To identify the neuronal circuits underlying sex differences, we performed whole brain c-Fos activity mapping under anesthesia in male and female mice. Consistent with a key role of the hypothalamus, we found fewer active neurons in the ventral hypothalamic sleep-promoting regions in females than in males. In humans, we demonstrate that females regain consciousness and recover cognition faster than males after identical anesthetic exposures. Remarkably, while behavioral and neurocognitive measures in mice and humans point to increased anesthetic resistance in females, cortical activity fails to show sex differences under anesthesia in either species. Cumulatively, we demonstrate that sex differences in anesthetic sensitivity are evolutionarily conserved and not reflected in conventional electroencephalographic-based measures of anesthetic depth. This covert resistance to anesthesia may explain the higher incidence of unintended awareness under general anesthesia in females.<sep>BackgroundBurst suppression occurs in the EEG during coma and under general anaesthesia. It has been assumed that burst suppression represents a deeper state of anaesthesia from which it is more difficult to recover. This has not been directly demonstrated, however. Here, we test this hypothesis directly by assessing relationships between EEG suppression in human volunteers and recovery of consciousness.MethodsWe recorded the EEG of 27 healthy humans (nine women/18 men) anaesthetised with isoflurane 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 3 h. Periods of EEG suppression and non-suppression were separated using principal component analysis of the spectrogram. After emergence, participants completed the digit symbol substitution test and the psychomotor vigilance test.ResultsVolunteers demonstrated marked variability in multiple features of the suppressed EEG. In order to test the hypothesis that, for an individual subject, inclusion of features of suppression would improve accuracy of a model built to predict time of emergence, two types of models were constructed: one with a suppression-related feature included and one without. Contrary to our hypothesis, Akaike information criterion demonstrated that the addition of a suppression-related feature did not improve the ability of the model to predict time to emergence. Furthermore, the amounts of EEG suppression and decrements in cognitive task performance relative to pre-anaesthesia baseline were not significantly correlated.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that, in contrast to current assumptions, EEG suppression in and of itself is not an important determinant of recovery time or the degree of cognitive impairment upon emergence from anaesthesia in healthy adults.<sep>Periods of low-amplitude electroencephalographic (EEG) signal (quiescence) are present during both anesthetic-induced burst suppression (BS) and postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression (PGES). PGES following generalized seizures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been previously linked to antidepressant response. The commonality of quiescence during both BS and PGES motivated trials to recapitulate the antidepressant effects of ECT using high doses of anesthetics. However, there have been no direct electrographic comparisons of these quiescent periods to address whether these are distinct entities.We compared periods of EEG quiescence recorded from two human studies: BS induced in 29 healthy adult volunteers by isoflurane general anesthesia and PGES in 11 patients undergoing right unilateral ECT for treatment-resistant depression. An automated algorithm allowed detection of EEG quiescence based on a 10-microvolt amplitude threshold. Spatial, spectral, and temporal analyses compared quiescent epochs during BS and PGES.The median (interquartile range) voltage for quiescent periods during PGES was greater than during BS (1.81 (0.22) microvolts vs 1.22 (0.33) microvolts, p < 0.001). Relative power was greater for quiescence during PGES than BS for the 1-4 Hz delta band (p < 0.001), at the expense of power in the theta (4-8 Hz, p < 0.001), beta (13-30 Hz, p = 0.04) and gamma (30-70 Hz, p = 0.006) frequency bands. Topographic analyses revealed that amplitude across the scalp was consistently higher for quiescent periods during PGES than BS, whose voltage was within the noise floor.Quiescent epochs during PGES and BS have distinct patterns of EEG signals across voltage, frequency, and spatial domains.Quiescent epochs during PGES and BS, important neurophysiological markers for clinical outcomes, are shown to have distinct voltage and frequency characteristics.<sep>Abstract Objective: Advanced age is associated with prominent impairment in allocentric navigation dependent on the hippocampus. This study examined whether age-related impairment in allocentric navigation and strategy selection was associated with sleep disruption or circadian rest-activity fragmentation. Further, we examined whether associations with navigation were moderated by perceived stress and physical activity. Method: Sleep fragmentation and total sleep time over the course of 1 week were assayed in younger ( n = 42) and older ( n = 37) adults via wrist actigraphy. Subsequently, participants completed cognitive mapping and route learning tasks, as well a measure of spontaneous navigation strategy selection. Measurements of perceived stress and an actigraphy-based index of physical activity were also obtained. Circadian rest-activity fragmentation was estimated via actigraphy post-hoc. Results: Age was associated with reduced cognitive mapping, route learning, allocentric strategy use, and total sleep time ( p s &lt; .01), replicating prior findings. Novel findings included that sleep fragmentation increased with advancing age ( p = .009) and was associated with lower cognitive mapping ( p = .022) within the older adult cohort. Total sleep time was not linearly associated with the navigation tasks ( p s &gt; .087). Post-hoc analyses revealed that circadian rest-activity fragmentation increased with advancing age within the older adults ( p = .026) and was associated with lower cognitive mapping across the lifespan ( p = .001) and within older adults ( p = .005). Neither stress nor physical activity were robust moderators of sleep fragmentation associations with the navigation tasks ( p s &gt; .113). Conclusion: Sleep fragmentation and circadian rest-activity fragmentation are potential contributing factors to age effects on cognitive mapping within older adults.<sep>Recent modeling and empirical studies support the hypothesis that large-scale brain networks function near a critical state. Similar functional connectivity patterns derived from resting state empirical data and brain network models at criticality provide further support. However, despite the strong implication of a relationship, there has been no principled explanation of how criticality shapes the characteristic functional connectivity in large-scale brain networks. Here, we hypothesized that the network science concept of partial phase locking is the underlying mechanism of optimal functional connectivity in the resting state. We further hypothesized that the characteristic connectivity of the critical state provides a theoretical boundary to quantify how far pharmacologically or pathologically perturbed brain connectivity deviates from its critical state, which could enable the differentiation of various states of consciousness with a theory-based metric. To test the hypothesis, we used a neuroanatomically informed brain network model with the resulting source signals projected to electroencephalogram (EEG)-like sensor signals with a forward model. Phase lag entropy (PLE), a measure of phase relation diversity, was estimated and the topography of PLE was analyzed. To measure the distance from criticality, the PLE topography at a critical state was compared with those of the EEG data from baseline consciousness, isoflurane anesthesia, ketamine anesthesia, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, and minimally conscious state. We demonstrate that the partial phase locking at criticality shapes the functional connectivity and asymmetric anterior-posterior PLE topography, with low (high) PLE for high (low) degree nodes. The topographical similarity and the strength of PLE differentiates various pharmacologic and pathologic states of consciousness. Moreover, this model-based EEG network analysis provides a novel metric to quantify how far a pharmacologically or pathologically perturbed brain network is away from critical state, rather than merely determining whether it is in a critical or non-critical state.<sep>Abstract Background The Clavien–Dindo classification is perhaps the most widely used approach for reporting postoperative complications in clinical trials. This system classifies complication severity by the treatment provided. However, it is unclear whether the Clavien–Dindo system can be used internationally in studies across differing healthcare systems in high- (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods This was a secondary analysis of the International Surgical Outcomes Study (ISOS), a prospective observational cohort study of elective surgery in adults. Data collection occurred over a 7-day period. Severity of complications was graded using Clavien–Dindo and the simpler ISOS grading (mild, moderate or severe, based on guided investigator judgement). Severity grading was compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Data are presented as frequencies and ICC values (with 95 per cent c.i.). The analysis was stratified by income status of the country, comparing HICs with LMICs. Results A total of 44 814 patients were recruited from 474 hospitals in 27 countries (19 HICs and 8 LMICs). Some 7508 patients (16·8 per cent) experienced at least one postoperative complication, equivalent to 11 664 complications in total. Using the ISOS classification, 5504 of 11 664 complications (47·2 per cent) were graded as mild, 4244 (36·4 per cent) as moderate and 1916 (16·4 per cent) as severe. Using Clavien–Dindo, 6781 of 11 664 complications (58·1 per cent) were graded as I or II, 1740 (14·9 per cent) as III, 2408 (20·6 per cent) as IV and 735 (6·3 per cent) as V. Agreement between classification systems was poor overall (ICC 0·41, 95 per cent c.i. 0·20 to 0·55), and in LMICs (ICC 0·23, 0·05 to 0·38) and HICs (ICC 0·46, 0·25 to 0·59). Conclusion Caution is recommended when using a treatment approach to grade complications in global surgery studies, as this may introduce bias unintentionally.<sep>Abstract Background Postoperative delirium is a common complication that hinders recovery after surgery. Intraoperative electroencephalogram suppression has been linked to postoperative delirium, but it is unknown if this relationship is causal or if electroencephalogram suppression is merely a marker of underlying cognitive abnormalities. The hypothesis of this study was that intraoperative electroencephalogram suppression mediates a nonzero portion of the effect between preoperative abnormal cognition and postoperative delirium. Methods This is a prespecified secondary analysis of the Electroencephalography Guidance of Anesthesia to Alleviate Geriatric Syndromes (ENGAGES) randomized trial, which enrolled patients age 60 yr or older undergoing surgery with general anesthesia at a single academic medical center between January 2015 and May 2018. Patients were randomized to electroencephalogram-guided anesthesia or usual care. Preoperative abnormal cognition was defined as a composite of previous delirium, Short Blessed Test cognitive score greater than 4 points, or Eight Item Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia score greater than 1 point. Duration of intraoperative electroencephalogram suppression was defined as number of minutes with suppression ratio greater than 1%. Postoperative delirium was detected via Confusion Assessment Method or chart review on postoperative days 1 to 5. Results Among 1,113 patients, 430 patients showed evidence of preoperative abnormal cognition. These patients had an increased incidence of postoperative delirium (151 of 430 [35%] vs.123 of 683 [18%], P &amp;lt; 0.001). Of this 17.2% total effect size (99.5% CI, 9.3 to 25.1%), an absolute 2.4% (99.5% CI, 0.6 to 4.8%) was an indirect effect mediated by electroencephalogram suppression, while an absolute 14.8% (99.5% CI, 7.2 to 22.5%) was a direct effect of preoperative abnormal cognition. Randomization to electroencephalogram-guided anesthesia did not change the mediated effect size (P = 0.078 for moderation). Conclusions A small portion of the total effect of preoperative abnormal cognition on postoperative delirium was mediated by electroencephalogram suppression. Study precision was too low to determine if the intervention changed the mediated effect. Editor’s Perspective What We Already Know about This Topic What This Article Tells Us That Is New<sep><h3>Importance</h3> Delirium is a common postoperative complication in older patients that often goes undetected and might lead to worse outcomes. The 3-Minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) might be a practical tool for routine clinical diagnosis of delirium. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess the 3D-CAM for detecting postoperative delirium compared with the long-form CAM used for research purposes. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study of older patients enrolled in ongoing clinical trials between 2015 and 2018 was conducted at a single tertiary US hospital. Included participants were aged 60 years or older undergoing major elective surgical procedures that required at least a 2-day hospital stay. Data were analyzed between February and April 2019. <h3>Exposures</h3> Surgical procedures of at least 2 hours in length requiring general anesthesia with planned extubation. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Patients were concurrently assessed for delirium using the 3D-CAM assessment and the long-form CAM, scored based on a standardized cognitive assessment. Agreement between these 2 methods was tested using Cohen κ with repeated measures, a generalized linear mixed-effects model, and Bland-Altman analysis. <h3>Results</h3> Sixteen raters conducted 471 concurrent CAM and 3D-CAM interviews including 299 patients (mean [SD] age, 69 [6.5] years), the majority of whom were men (152 [50.8%]), were White (263 [88.0%]), and had noncardiac operations (211 [70.6%]). Both instruments had good intraclass correlation (0.84 for the CAM and 0.98 for the 3D-CAM). Cohen κ demonstrated good overall agreement between the CAM and 3D-CAM (κ = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83). According to the mixed-effects model, there was statistically significant disagreement between the 3D-CAM and CAM (estimated difference in fixed effect, −0.68; 95% CI, −1.32 to −0.05;<i>P</i> = .04). Bland-Altman analysis showed the probability of a delirium diagnosis with the 3D-CAM was more than twice the probability of a delirium diagnosis with the CAM (probability ratio, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.44 to 3.23). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> The 3D-CAM instrument demonstrated agreement with the long-form CAM and might provide a pragmatic and sensitive clinical tool for detecting postoperative delirium, with the caveat that the 3D-CAM might overdiagnose delirium.<sep>Abstract Introduction High and low sleep duration have been associated with reduced executive function (EF) and episodic memory (EM). However, causal pathways have not been identified. Cardiovascular health may contribute to the relationship between sleep and cognitive aging. Sleep disturbance has been associated with increased hypertension and heart disease in older adults, and cerebrovascular insufficiency has been consistently linked with cognitive decline. Therefore, the mediating and moderating effects of cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) on the relationship between sleep duration and longitudinal change in EF and EM were examined. Methods Statistical analyses were preregistered (osf.io/6yw7g). Average total sleep time (TST) over 2-6 nights was estimated using single-channel EEG at baseline (N=332). CVD was estimated using the abbreviated Framingham Heart Score approximately one year post-baseline. Outcome variables were linear change in EF and EM composite scores [BL1] per year up to 7 years after baseline. EF subtests measured semantic fluency, working memory, and task switching. EM subtests measured verbal associative memory, narrative episodic memory, and list learning. Covariates included age, gender, Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers (ratio of phosphorylated tau181 to amyloid-ß42), global cognition, and apnea-hypopnea index. Results Greater TST was linearly associated with reduced CVD (ß=-.157, p=.006). Quadratic effects of TST on EF and EM were observed (EF: ß=-.105, p=.002; EM: ß=-.203, p=.007). Lowest TST was related to greater reduction in EF; highest TST was related to greater reduction in EF and EM. Mediating effects of CVD for EF and EM were observed (ps&amp;lt;.05) but were non-significant when age and AD biomarkers were included (p=.10, p=.08, respectively). A non-significant trend indicated CVD moderated effects of TST on EF (ß=.10, p=.055), controlling for age and AD biomarkers. Less sleep combined with higher CVD tended to be associated with greater decline in EF. CVD did not moderate effects of TST on EM (ß=.07, p=.254). Conclusion Consistent with prior literature, CVD and TST were independently associated with cognitive decline. Although findings suggest that CVD may influence effects of TST on cognitive decline, more evidence is needed. Future analyses will examine alternative sleep measures (e.g., sleep efficiency, slow wave spectral density).

This study tested the hypothesis that perioperative epidural use would be associated with decreased risk of delirium through postoperative day 3. METHODS: This was a secondary, observational, nonrandomized analysis of data from The Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated With Surgical Treatments Trial (PODCAST; NCT01690988). The primary outcome of the current study was the incidence of delirium (ie, any positive delirium screen, postanesthesia care unit through postoperative day 3) in surgical patients (gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary-pancreatic, gynecologic, and urologic) receiving postoperative epidural analgesia compared to those without an epidural. As a secondary outcome, all delirium assessments were then longitudinally analyzed in relation to epidural use throughout the follow-up period. Given the potential relevance to delirium, postoperative pain, opioid consumption, sleep disturbances, and symptoms of depression were also analyzed as secondary outcomes. A semiparsimonious multivariable logistic regression model was used to test the association between postoperative epidural use and delirium incidence, and generalized estimating equations were used to test associations with secondary outcomes described. Models included relevant covariates to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: In total, 263 patients were included for analysis. Epidural use was not independently associated with reduced delirium incidence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.32–1.35]; P = .247). However, when analyzing all assessments over the follow-up period, epidural patients were 64% less likely to experience an episode of delirium (adjusted odds ratio, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.17–0.78]; P = .009). Adjusted pain scores (visual analog scale, 0–100 mm) were significantly lower in the epidural group on postoperative day 1 (morning, −16 [95% CI, −26 to −7], P &lt; .001; afternoon, −15 [95% CI, −25 to −5], P &lt; .01) and postoperative day 3 (morning, −13 [95% CI, −20 to −5], P &lt; .01). Adjusted mean oral and IV morphine equivalents were also significantly lower on postoperative day 1 in the epidural group (74% lower [95% CI, 55%–85%]; P &lt; .0001). Finally, postoperative epidural use was not significantly associated with new sleep disturbances or changes in depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative epidural use was not associated with a reduced overall incidence of delirium. However, longitudinal analysis revealed reduced adjusted odds of experiencing an episode of delirium in the epidural group. Epidural use was also associated with reduced postoperative pain and opioid consumption. An appropriately designed follow-up study is warranted to further analyze the relationship among epidural use, postoperative delirium, and related outcomes.<sep><h3>Importance</h3> Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform suppression, often suggesting excessive general anesthesia, has been associated with postoperative delirium. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess whether EEG-guided anesthetic administration decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Randomized clinical trial of 1232 adults aged 60 years and older undergoing major surgery and receiving general anesthesia at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis. Recruitment was from January 2015 to May 2018, with follow-up until July 2018. <h3>Interventions</h3> Patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified by cardiac vs noncardiac surgery and positive vs negative recent fall history) to receive EEG-guided anesthetic administration (n = 614) or usual anesthetic care (n = 618). <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcome was incident delirium during postoperative days 1 through 5. Intraoperative measures included anesthetic concentration, EEG suppression, and hypotension. Adverse events included undesirable intraoperative movement, intraoperative awareness with recall, postoperative nausea and vomiting, medical complications, and death. <h3>Results</h3> Of the 1232 randomized patients (median age, 69 years [range, 60 to 95]; 563 women [45.7%]), 1213 (98.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome. Delirium during postoperative days 1 to 5 occurred in 157 of 604 patients (26.0%) in the guided group and 140 of 609 patients (23.0%) in the usual care group (difference, 3.0% [95% CI, −2.0% to 8.0%];<i>P</i> = .22). Median end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration was significantly lower in the guided group than the usual care group (0.69 vs 0.80 minimum alveolar concentration; difference, −0.11 [95% CI, −0.13 to −0.10), and median cumulative time with EEG suppression was significantly less (7 vs 13 minutes; difference, −6.0 [95% CI, −9.9 to −2.1]). There was no significant difference between groups in the median cumulative time with mean arterial pressure below 60 mm Hg (7 vs 7 minutes; difference, 0.0 [95% CI, −1.7 to 1.7]). Undesirable movement occurred in 137 patients (22.3%) in the guided and 95 (15.4%) in the usual care group. No patients reported intraoperative awareness. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported in 48 patients (7.8%) in the guided and 55 patients (8.9%) in the usual care group. Serious adverse events were reported in 124 patients (20.2%) in the guided and 130 (21.0%) in the usual care group. Within 30 days of surgery, 4 patients (0.65%) in the guided group and 19 (3.07%) in the usual care group died. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Among older adults undergoing major surgery, EEG-guided anesthetic administration, compared with usual care, did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium.

This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the synovial microenvironment can be modified to allow resident skeletal stem cells to form hyaline articular cartilage and thereby regenerate injured articular cartilage.<sep>Sexually dimorphic tissues are formed by cells that are regulated by sex hormones. While a number of systemic hormones and transcription factors are known to regulate proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the mechanisms that determine sexually dimorphic differences in bone regeneration are unclear. To explore how sex hormones regulate bone regeneration, we compared bone fracture repair between adult male and female mice. We found that skeletal stem cell (SSC) mediated regeneration in female mice is dependent on estrogen signaling but SSCs from male mice do not exhibit similar estrogen responsiveness. Mechanistically, we found that estrogen acts directly on the SSC lineage in mice and humans by up-regulating multiple skeletogenic pathways and is necessary for the stem cell's ability to self- renew and differentiate. Our results also suggest a clinically applicable strategy to accelerate bone healing using localized estrogen hormone therapy.<sep>Skeletal stem and progenitor cell populations are crucial for bone physiology. Characterization of these cell types remains restricted to heterogenous bulk populations with limited information on whether they are unique or overlap with previously characterized cell types. Here we show, through comprehensive functional and single-cell transcriptomic analyses, that postnatal long bones of mice contain at least two types of bone progenitors with bona fide skeletal stem cell (SSC) characteristics. An early osteochondral SSC (ocSSC) facilitates long bone growth and repair, while a second type, a perivascular SSC (pvSSC), co-emerges with long bone marrow and contributes to shape the hematopoietic stem cell niche and regenerative demand. We establish that pvSSCs, but not ocSSCs, are the origin of bone marrow adipose tissue. Lastly, we also provide insight into residual SSC heterogeneity as well as potential crosstalk between the two spatially distinct cell populations. These findings comprehensively address previously unappreciated shortcomings of SSC research.<sep>Peripheral vascular disease remains a leading cause of vascular morbidity and mortality worldwide despite advances in medical and surgical therapy. Besides traditional approaches, which can only restore blood flow to native arteries, an alternative approach is to enhance the growth of new vessels, thereby facilitating the physiological response to ischemia.The ActinCreER/R26VT2/GK3 Rainbow reporter mouse was used for unbiased in vivo survey of injury-responsive vasculogenic clonal formation. Prospective isolation and transplantation were used to determine vessel-forming capacity of different populations. Single-cell RNA-sequencing was used to characterize distinct vessel-forming populations and their interactions.Two populations of distinct vascular stem/progenitor cells (VSPCs) were identified from adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells: VSPC1 is CD45-Ter119-Tie2+PDGFRa-CD31+CD105highSca1low, which gives rise to stunted vessels (incomplete tubular structures) in a transplant setting, and VSPC2 which is CD45-Ter119-Tie2+PDGFRa+CD31-CD105lowSca1high and forms stunted vessels and fat. Interestingly, cotransplantation of VSPC1 and VSPC2 is required to form functional vessels that improve perfusion in the mouse hindlimb ischemia model. Similarly, VSPC1 and VSPC2 populations isolated from human adipose tissue could rescue the ischemic condition in mice.These findings suggest that autologous cotransplantation of synergistic VSPCs from nonessential adipose tissue can promote neovascularization and represents a promising treatment for ischemic disease.<sep>Loss of skeletal integrity during ageing and disease is associated with an imbalance in the opposing actions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts1. Here we show that intrinsic ageing of skeletal stem cells (SSCs)2 in mice alters signalling in the bone marrow niche and skews the differentiation of bone and blood lineages, leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Functionally, aged SSCs have a decreased bone- and cartilage-forming potential but produce more stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies link the functional loss to a diminished transcriptomic diversity of SSCs in aged mice, which thereby contributes to the transformation of the bone marrow niche. Exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis or systemic reconstitution with young haematopoietic stem cells did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged SSCs, or improve bone mass or skeletal healing parameters in aged mice. Conversely, the aged SSC lineage promoted osteoclastic activity and myeloid skewing by haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that the ageing of SSCs is a driver of haematopoietic ageing. Deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be returned to youthful levels by applying a combinatorial treatment of BMP2 and a CSF1 antagonist locally to fractures, which reactivated aged SSCs and simultaneously ablated the inflammatory, pro-osteoclastic milieu. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the complex, multifactorial mechanisms that underlie skeletal ageing and offer prospects for rejuvenating the aged skeletal system.<sep>The intervertebral disc, also known as the spinal disc, deteriorates faster than other connective tissues, leading to spinal disc degeneration. Addressing this requires effective treatments to reverse fibrocartilage damage that can occur due to factors such as age and injury. Tissue resident stem cells offer potential for spinal disc treatment due to their self-renewal and differentiation properties. We’ve leveraged our expertise in skeletal stem cell (SSC) biology to isolate purified SSCs from the spine that show regional differences in bone and cartilage commitment. Specifically, SSCs from spinal disc versus vertebral bone inherently generate more chondrogenic and osteogenic tissue, respectively. We find that Hoxa4 is exclusively upregulated in spinal versus femur SSCs and is vital for spinal SSC differentiation into cartilage and bone. Through scRNAseq analysis, we discover Hedgehog (Hh) signaling to be activated in inner versus outer chondrocyte populations within spinal disc. Additionally, Shh extrinsically guides spinal SSCs to make bone instead of cartilage in vitro, and when delivered via hydrogel into the injured annulus fibrosus of the mouse caudal disc favored regeneration into bone tissue in vivo. Conversely, inhibition of Shh promoted the regeneration of cartilage and complete repair of disc thickness. Importantly, we find that Shh is an upstream modulator of Hoxa4. Studies on patient disc samples confirmed the importance of Hoxa4 for cartilage commitment in analogous human SSC populations. Our findings define SSC diversity within the spine and pave the way for stem cell-based treatments for spinal disc-related diseases.<sep>Abstract Fragility fractures have a limited capacity to regenerate, and impaired fracture healing is a leading cause of morbidity in the elderly. The recent identification of a highly purified bona fide human skeletal stem cell (hSSC) and its committed downstream progenitor cell populations provides an opportunity for understanding the mechanism of age‐related compromised fracture healing from the stem cell perspective. In this study, we tested whether hSSCs isolated from geriatric fractures demonstrate intrinsic functional defects that drive impaired healing. Using flow cytometry, we analyzed and isolated hSSCs from callus tissue of five different skeletal sites ( n = 61) of patients ranging from 13 to 94 years of age for functional and molecular studies. We observed that fracture‐activated amplification of hSSC populations was comparable at all ages. However, functional analysis of isolated stem cells revealed that advanced age significantly correlated with reduced osteochondrogenic potential but was not associated with decreased in vitro clonogenicity. hSSCs derived from women displayed an exacerbated functional decline with age relative to those of aged men. Transcriptomic comparisons revealed downregulation of skeletogenic pathways such as WNT and upregulation of senescence‐related pathways in young versus older hSSCs. Strikingly, loss of Sirtuin1 expression played a major role in hSSC dysfunction but re‐activation by trans‐resveratrol or a small molecule compound restored in vitro differentiation potential. These are the first findings that characterize age‐related defects in purified hSSCs from geriatric fractures. Our results provide a foundation for future investigations into the mechanism and reversibility of skeletal stem cell aging in humans.<sep>Human skeletal stem cells (hSSCs) hold tremendous therapeutic potential for developing new clinical strategies to effectively combat congenital and age-related musculoskeletal disorders. Unfortunately, refined methodologies for the proper isolation of bona fide hSSCs and the development of functional assays that accurately recapitulate their physiology within the skeleton have been lacking. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), commonly used to describe the source of precursors for osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes and stroma, have held great promise as the basis of various approaches for cell therapy. However, the reproducibility and clinical efficacy of these attempts have been obscured by the heterogeneous nature of BMSCs due to their isolation by plastic adherence techniques. To address these limitations, our group has refined the purity of individual progenitor populations that are encompassed by BMSCs by identifying defined populations of bona fide hSSCs and their downstream progenitors that strictly give rise to skeletally restricted cell lineages. Here, we describe an advanced flow cytometric approach that utilizes an extensive panel of eight cell surface markers to define hSSCs; bone, cartilage and stromal progenitors; and more differentiated unipotent subtypes, including an osteogenic subset and three chondroprogenitors. We provide detailed instructions for the FACS-based isolation of hSSCs from various tissue sources, in vitro and in vivo skeletogenic functional assays, human xenograft mouse models and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. This application of hSSC isolation can be performed by any researcher with basic skills in biology and flow cytometry within 1-2 days. The downstream functional assays can be performed within a range of 1-2 months.</abstract>", "<keyword>Methanol<sep>Promotion (chess)<sep>Quantitative trait

trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and stroke incident risk. However, a causal role of gut microbes in stroke has not yet been demonstrated. Herein we show that gut microbes, through dietary choline and TMAO generation, directly impact cerebral infarct size and adverse outcomes following stroke. Fecal microbial transplantation from low- versus high-TMAO-producing human subjects into germ-free mice shows that both TMAO generation and stroke severity are transmissible traits. Furthermore, employing multiple murine stroke models and transplantation of defined microbial communities with genetically engineered human commensals into germ-free mice, we demonstrate that the microbial cutC gene (an enzymatic source of choline-to-TMA transformation) is sufficient to transmit TMA/TMAO production, heighten cerebral infarct size, and<sep>Recent studies show gut microbiota-dependent metabolism of dietary phenylalanine into phenylacetic acid (PAA) is critical in phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln) production, a metabolite linked to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Accordingly, microbial enzymes involved in this transformation are of interest. Using genetic manipulation in selected microbes and monocolonization experiments in gnotobiotic mice, we identify two distinct gut microbial pathways for PAA formation; one is catalyzed by phenylpyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PPFOR) and the other by phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (PPDC). PPFOR and PPDC play key roles in gut bacterial PAA production via oxidative and non-oxidative phenylpyruvate decarboxylation, respectively. Metagenomic analyses revealed a significantly higher abundance of both pathways in gut microbiomes of ASCVD patients compared with controls. The present studies show a role for these two divergent microbial<sep>Autoantibodies against apolipoprotein A-I (anti-apoA-I IgGs) are prevalent in atherosclerosis-related conditions. It remains elusive whether they improve the prognostic accuracy of the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score 2.0 (GS) in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In this prospective multicenter registry, 1713 ACS patients were included and followed for 1 year. The primary endpoint (major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)) was defined as the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke (including transient ischemic attack), or cardiovascular (CV) death with individual events independently adjudicated. Plasma levels of anti-apoA-I IgGs upon study inclusion were assessed using ELISA. The association between anti-apoA-I IgGs and incident MACE was assessed using Cox models with splines and C-statistics. One-year MACE incidence was 8.4% (144/1713).

These associations could be mediated by insulin resistance. However, the relationships among these metabolites, insulin resistance and NAFLD have not been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, it has recently been suggested that TMAO could play a role in NAFLD by altering bile acid metabolism. We examined the association between circulating TMAO, choline and betaine levels and NAFLD in obese subjects.Serum TMAO, choline, betaine and bile acid levels were measured in 357 Mexican obese patients with different grades of NAFLD as determined by liver histology. Associations of NAFLD with TMAO, choline and betaine levels were tested. Moreover, association of<sep>Recent studies show a mechanistic link between gut microbiota-dependent formation of the atherosclerosis- and thrombosis-promoting metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The clinical utility of TMAO in apparently healthy subjects for predicting incident CVD risks is unclear.In the EPIC-Norfolk community-based study, we examined baseline fasting levels of TMAO and two of its nutrient precursors, choline and betaine, in a case:control design study comparing apparently European healthy middle-aged participants who subsequently develop CVD (Cases, n = 908) vs those who did not (Controls, n = 1,273) over an ensuing average follow-up period of 8 years. In participants who developed CVD vs controls, higher plasma TMAO (3.70 [IQR 2.50-6.41]μM vs 3.25 [IQR 2.19-52,1.15]μM; P < .001) and choline levels (9.09 [IQR<sep>Background: The gut microbiota-dependent metabolite phenylacetylgutamine (PAGln) is both associated with atherothrombotic heart disease in humans, and mechanistically linked to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis in animal models via modulation of adrenergic receptor signaling. Methods: Here we examined both clinical and mechanistic relationships between PAGln and heart failure (HF). First, we examined associations among plasma levels of PAGln and HF, left ventricular ejection fraction, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in 2 independent clinical cohorts of subjects undergoing coronary angiography in tertiary referral centers (an initial discovery US Cohort, n=3256; and a validation European Cohort, n=829). Then, the impact of PAGln on cardiovascular phenotypes relevant to HF in cultured cardiomyoblasts, and in vivo were also examined. Results: Circulating PAGln levels were dose-dependently associated with<sep>ABSTRACT Background Phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln) is a phenylalanine‐derived metabolite produced by gut microbiota with mechanistic links to hear failure (HF)‐relevant phenotypes. We sought to investigate the prognostic value of PAGln in patients with stable HF. Methods and results Fasting plasma PAGln levels were measured by stable‐isotope‐dilution LC‐MS/MS in patients with stable HF from two large cohorts. All‐cause mortality was assessed at 5‐year follow up in the Cleveland Cohort, and HF, hospitalization, or mortality were assessed at 3‐year follow up in the Berlin Cohort. Fasting PAGln levels were measured by stable‐isotope‐dilution LC‐MS/MS. Within the Cleveland cohort, median PAGln levels were 4.2[IQR 2.4‐6.9] μM. Highest quartile of PAGln was associated with 3.09‐fold increased mortality risk compared to lowest quartile.

H2S research is limited by the lack of an accurate internal standard-containing assay for its quantitation in biological matrices.After synthesizing [34S]H2S and developing sample preparation protocols that avoid sulfide contamination with the addition of thiol-containing standards or reducing reagents, we developed a stable isotope-dilution high performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of Total H2S and other abundant thiols (cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, glutamylcysteine, cysteinylglycine) in biological matrices, conducted a 20-day analytical validation/normal range study, and then both analyzed circulating Total H2S and thiols in plasma from 400 subjects, and within 20 volunteers before<sep>Background: Animal studies suggest that gut microbiome metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) may influence cognitive function and dementia risk. However potential health effects of TMAO and related metabolites remain unclear. Objective: We examined prospective associations of TMAO, γ-butyrobetaine, crotonobetaine, carnitine, choline, and betaine with risk of cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults aged 65 years and older in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Methods: TMAO and metabolites were measured in stored plasma specimens collected at baseline. Incident cognitive impairment was assessed using the 100-point Modified Mini-Mental State Examination administered serially up to 7 times. Clinical dementia was identified using neuropsychological tests adjudicated by CHS Cognition Study investigators, and by ICD-9 codes from linked Medicare data.

The study aimed to investigate associations of serially measured plasma TMAO levels and changes in TMAO over time with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a multi-ethnic community-based cohort.The study included 6,785 adults from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. TMAO was measured at baseline and year 5 using mass spectrometry. Primary outcomes were adjudicated all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Secondary outcomes were deaths due to kidney failure, cancer, or dementia obtained from death certificates. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying TMAO and<sep>Carnitine metabolism produces numerous molecular species of short-, medium-, and long-chain acylcarnitines, which play important roles in energy homeostasis and fatty acid transport in the myocardium. Given that disturbances in the carnitine metabolism are linked to cardiometabolic disease, we studied the relationship of circulating acylcarnitines with outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and evaluated differences in circulating levels of these metabolites between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.Harnessing a prospective multicentre cohort study (SPUM-ACS; NCT01000701), we measured plasma levels of acylcarnitines, carnitine, and carnitine metabolites to assess their relationship with adjudicated major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, clinically indicated revascularization, or death of any cause. The SPUM-ACS study enrolled patients presenting with ACS to Swiss<sep>Some species of fish and seafood are high in trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which accumulates in muscle where it protects against pressure and cold. Trimethylamine (TMA), the metabolic precursor to TMAO, is formed in fish during bacterial spoilage. Fish intake is promoted for its potential cardioprotective effects. However, numerous studies show TMAO has pro-atherothrombotic properties. Here, we determined the effects of fish or seafood consumption on circulating TMAO levels in participants with normal renal function.TMAO and omega-3 fatty acid content were quantified across multiple different fish or seafood species by mass spectrometry. Healthy volunteers (n = 50) were recruited for three studies. Participants in the first study consented to 5 consecutive weekly blood draws and provided dietary recall for the 24 h<sep>Background Trimethylamine‐ N ‐oxide (TMAO) is a small molecule derived from the metabolism of dietary nutrients by gut microbes and contributes to cardiovascular disease. Plasma TMAO increases following consumption of red meat. This metabolic change is thought to be partly because of the expansion of gut microbes able to use nutrients abundant in red meat. Methods and Results We used data from a randomized crossover study to estimate the degree to which TMAO can be estimated from fecal microbial composition. Healthy participants received a series of 3 diets that differed in protein source (red meat, white meat, and non‐meat), and fecal, plasma, and urine samples were collected following 4 weeks of exposure to each diet. TMAO was quantitated in plasma and<sep>Precision microbiome modulation as a novel treatment strategy is a rapidly evolving and sought goal. The aim of this study is to determine relationships among systemic gut microbial metabolite levels and incident cardiovascular disease risks to identify gut microbial pathways as possible targets for personalized therapeutic interventions.Stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry methods to quantitatively measure aromatic amino acids and their metabolites were used to examine sequential subjects undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac evaluation in two independent cohorts with longitudinal outcome data [US (n = 4000) and EU (n = 833) cohorts].

Eggs are rich in choline, yet the impact of habitual egg consumption on TMAO levels and platelet function in human subjects remains unclear. Methods Healthy volunteers (41% male, 81% Caucasian, median age 28 years) with normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate >60) were recruited and assigned to 1 of 5 daily interventions for 4 weeks: 1) hardboiled eggs (n = 18); 2) choline bitartrate supplements (n = 20); 3) hardboiled eggs + choline bitartrate supplements (n = 16); 4) egg whites + choline bitartrate supplements (n = 18); 5) phosphatidylcholine supplements (n = 10).

However, the diagnostic value of TMAO and its precursors have not been assessed for functionally relevant coronary artery disease (fCAD) and its prognostic potential in this setting needs to be evaluated.Among 1726 patients with suspected fCAD serum TMAO, and its precursors betaine, choline and carnitine, were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Diagnosis of fCAD was performed by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPI-SPECT) and coronary angiography blinded to marker concentrations. Incident all-cause death, cardiovascular death (CVD) and myocardial infarction (MI) were assessed during 5-years follow-up.Concentrations of TMAO, betaine, choline and carnitine were significantly higher in patients with fCAD versus those without (TMAO 5.33 μM vs 4.66 μM, p <<sep>Abstract Background Cholesterol efflux capacity is a tissue culture assay for HDL function that is not amenable for high-throughput monitoring of risk assessment. Methods We devised a cell-free HDL function assay to measure the exchange rate of exogenous apoA1 into serum HDL using NBD/Alexa647 double-labeled apoA1, whose NBD/Alexa647 emission ratio increased upon exchange into HDL. ApoA1 exchange rate (AER) was assayed by incubating labeled apoA1 with human serum, and the rate of the increase of the NBD/Alexa647 ratio over time was calculated as AER. Results Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis of serum confirmed that the labeled apoA1 selectively exchanged into the HDL lipoprotein fraction. Characterization studies demonstrated that the AER assay had excellent intra- and inter-day reproducibility, was stable over 3<sep>Abstract Background Dietary intake influences gut microbiome composition, which in turn may be associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). Associations of the gut microbiome with colorectal carcinogenesis may be mediated through bacterially regulated, metabolically active metabolites, including trimethylamine N‐oxide (TMAO) and its precursors, choline, L‐ carnitine, and betaine. Methods Prospective associations of circulating TMAO and its precursors with CRC risk were investigated. TMAO, choline, betaine, and L ‐carnitine were measured in baseline serum samples from 761 incident CRC cases and 1:1 individually matched controls in the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial Cohort using targeted fully quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry panels. Prospective associations of the metabolites with CRC risk, using multivariable conditional logistic regression, were measured. Associations of<sep>Stroke is the second most common cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. Vascular dementia (VaD), a cognitive impairment following a stroke, is common and significantly impacts the quality of life. We recently demonstrated via gut microbe transplant studies that the gut microbe-dependent trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) pathway impacts stroke severity, both infarct size and long-term cognitive outcomes. However, the molecular mechanisms that underly the role of the microbiome in VaD have not been explored in depth. To address this issue, we performed a comprehensive RNA-sequencing analysis to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes in the ischemic cerebral cortex of mouse brains at pre-stroke and post-stroke day 1 and day 3. A total of 4016, 3752 and 7861 DE genes were identified at pre-stroke and<sep>The heightened cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk observed among omnivores is thought to be linked, in part, to gut microbiota-dependent generation of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) from L-carnitine, a nutrient abundant in red meat. Gut microbial transformation of L-carnitine into trimethylamine (TMA), the precursor of TMAO, occurs via the intermediate γ-butyrobetaine (γBB). However, the interrelationship of γBB, red meat ingestion and CVD risks, as well as the gut microbial genes responsible for the transformation of γBB to TMA, are unclear. In the present study, we show that plasma γBB levels in individuals from a clinical cohort (n = 2,918) are strongly associated with incident CVD event risks. Culture of human faecal samples and microbial transplantation studies in gnotobiotic mice with defined synthetic communities showed<sep>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common but poorly understood form of heart failure, characterized by impaired diastolic function. It is highly heterogeneous with multiple comorbidities, including obesity and diabetes, making human studies difficult.Metabolomic analyses in a mouse model of HFpEF showed that levels of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), a metabolite produced by gut bacteria from tryptophan, were reduced in the plasma and heart tissue of HFpEF mice as compared with controls. We then examined the role of IPA in mouse models of HFpEF as well as 2 human HFpEF cohorts.The protective role and therapeutic effects of IPA were confirmed in mouse models of HFpEF using IPA dietary supplementation.

We examined the relationship between plasma TML levels and incident CV events in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).Plasma levels of TML were quantified in two independent cohorts using mass spectrometry, and its relationship with CV events was investigated. In a Cleveland Cohort (N = 530), comprised of patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain and suspected ACS, TML was associated with major adverse cardiac events (MACE, myocardial infarction, stroke, need for revascularization, or all-cause mortality) over both 30 days [3rd tertile (T3), adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI)<sep>Despite the advent of catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic medications, atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a significant source or morbidity and mortality.

To examine the relationship of TMAO and related dietary trimethylamines with incident AF in a combined analysis of two large, community-based, prospective cohorts with cardiovascular outcomes. We examined 11,751 individuals from two community-based cohorts, the Cardiovascular Health Study and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, followed prospectively for incident AF.

This study aims to investigate the role of TMAO in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and target its parent microbes as a potential pharmacological intervention. Methods: TMAO and choline metabolites were examined in plasma samples, with associated clinical data, from 2 independent patient cohorts (N=2129 total). Mice were fed a high-choline diet and underwent 2 murine AAA models, angiotensin II infusion in low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient ( Ldlr −/− ) mice or topical porcine pancreatic elastase in C57BL/6J mice.

The metaorganismal metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is both associated with adverse clinical thromboembolic events, and enhances platelet responsiveness in subjects. The impact of TMAO on vascular Tissue Factor (TF) in vivo is unknown. Here, we explore whether TMAO-enhanced thrombosis potential extends beyond TMAO effects on platelets, and is linked to TF.

In this article, we review such cases. Clinically, the age of patients ranged from 28 to 83 years with a mean age of 62.8 years. The size of the tumor ranged from 1.9 to 19.5 cm with a mean size of 8.7 cm. The tumor demonstrated a variety of architectural patterns such as solid, alveolar, papillary, pseudopapillary, nested or tubular. The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade usually corresponds to grade 3 or 4. Cytomorphology shows eosinophilic, clear, amphophilic or even oncocytic cytoplasm. Necrosis can be frequently observed. Neoplastic cells with TFEB-amplified RCC show diffuse or patchy positivity for TFEB. Fluorescence in situ hybridization frequently show the amplification of more than 10 or 20 copies of the TFEB gene. Most TFEB-amplified RCCs behave in an aggressive fashion. Metastasis frequently occurs. In conclusion, this tumor seems to be characterized by occurrence in older patients, frequent necrosis, papillary/pseudopapillary growth pattern, high-grade nuclear grade, TFEB gene amplification, and aggressive clinical behavior. In order to clarify whether this tumor is a distinct entity from previously described renal tumors or not, a further examination in a large scale study will be required in the future.</abstract>", "<keyword>RADIUS<sep>Psyche<sep>Osiris<sep>Ecliptic<sep>Meteoroid<sep>Sampling (signal processing)<sep>Regolith<sep>Terrestrial planet<sep>Asteroid<sep>Metal<sep>Bottleneck<sep>Angular momentum<sep>Asteroid belt<sep>Field (mathematics)<sep>Near-Earth object<sep>Silicate<sep>Deflection (physics)<sep>Inference<sep>Accretion (finance)<sep>Infrared<sep>Spacecraft<sep>Planetesimal<sep>Binary number<sep>Mars Exploration Program<sep>Bayesian inference<sep>Emissivity<sep>Ejecta<sep>Dart<sep>Meteorite<sep>Construct (python library)<sep>Trojan<sep>Spectral line<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Kinetic energy<sep>Exoplanet<sep>Collision<sep>Albedo (alchemy)<sep>Radiation pressure<sep>Mantle (geology)<sep>Giant planet<sep>Population<sep>Earth radius<sep>Venus<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Range (aeronautics)<sep>Cruise<sep>Thermal<sep>Surface roughness<sep>Iron meteorite<sep>Pile<sep>Set (abstract data type)<sep>Merge (version control)<sep>Cohesion (chemistry)<sep>Rubble<sep>Water ice<sep>Extinction event<sep>Breccia<sep>Telescope<sep>Planet<sep>Chondrite<sep>Porosity<sep>Planetary exploration<sep>Equator<sep>Planetary science</keyword><title>Integrating Machine Learning for Planetary Science: Perspectives for the Next Decade<sep>Integrating Machine Learning for Planetary Science: Perspectives for the\n  Next Decade<sep>OSIRIS-REx low-velocity particles during outbound cruise<sep>Near-zero cohesion and loose packing of Bennu’s near subsurface revealed by spacecraft contact<sep>Combining machine-learned regression models with Bayesian inference to interpret remote sensing data<sep>A New Database of Giant Impacts over a Wide Range of Masses and with\n  Material Strength: A First Analysis of Outcomes<sep>Asteroid (101955) Bennu’s weak boulders and thermally anomalous equator<sep>An improved model of metal/silicate differentiation during Earth's accretion<sep>An improved model of metal/silicate differentiation during Earth's\n  accretion<sep>Realistic On-the-fly Outcomes of Planetary Collisions.

We interpret them as water-ice particles that translated across the imager’s field of view, originating from the spacecraft itself. Their translation velocities approximated 0.1–1 m/s based on reasonable conclusions about their range. Pursuing several lines of investigation to seek a coherent hypothesis, we conclude that the episodic releases of the water ice particles are associated with spacecraft attitudes that resulted in solar illumination of previously shadowed regions. This correlation suggests that the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft itself possesses micro-climatic zones consisting of hot regions and cold traps that may temporarily potentially pass volatiles back and forth before losing most of them.<sep>When the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft pressed its sample collection mechanism into the surface of Bennu, it provided a direct test of the poorly understood near-subsurface physical properties of rubble-pile asteroids, which consist of rock fragments at rest in microgravity. Here, we find that the forces measured by the spacecraft are best modeled as a granular bed with near-zero cohesion that is half as dense as the bulk asteroid. The low gravity of a small rubble-pile asteroid such as Bennu effectively weakens its near subsurface by not compressing the upper layers, thereby minimizing the influence of interparticle cohesion on surface geology. The underdensity and weak near subsurface should be global properties of Bennu and not localized to the contact point.<sep>The need to build more comprehensive planetary science theories requires observations from remote sensing and in-situ platforms. Space missions, telescopic surveys and laboratory experiments collect large amounts of data, but their combined interpretation typically requires intensive modeling. This may result in prohibitively high computational costs as the number of parameters increases. Here we describe a case study for asteroid thermophysical analysis [12] to show how neural networks can be trained on a large but sparse data set of model simulations to learn the relationship between the output and input of a physical process. The resulting “surrogate model” can then be efficiently used to infer the properties of the system, facilitating combined observations across instruments and platforms. This approach allows extracting more consistent and accurate information from planetary science data, and can enhance autonomous decision-making onboard robotic spacecraft and landers.<sep>In the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, planets are predicted to undergo pairwise collisions known as giant impacts. Here we present a high-resolution database of giant impacts for differentiated colliding bodies of iron-silicate composition, with target masses ranging from 10^-4 M_Earth up to super-Earths (5 M_Earth). We vary impactor-to-target mass ratio, core-mantle (iron-silicate) fraction, impact velocity, and impact angle. Strength in the form of friction is included in all simulations. We find that due to strength, collisions with bodies smaller than about 2*10^-3 M_Earth can result in irregular shapes, compound core structures, and captured binaries. We observe that the characteristic escaping velocity of smaller remnants (debris) is approximately half of the impact velocity, significantly faster than currently assumed in N-body simulations of planet formation. Incorporating these results in N-body planet formation studies would provide more realistic debris-debris and<sep>Thermal inertia and surface roughness are proxies for the physical characteristics of planetary surfaces. Global maps of these two properties distinguish the boulder population on near-Earth asteroid (NEA) (101955) Bennu into two types that differ in strength, and both have lower thermal inertia than expected for boulders and meteorites. Neither has strongly temperature-dependent thermal properties. The weaker boulder type probably would not survive atmospheric entry and thus may not be represented in the meteorite collection. The maps also show a high-thermal inertia band at Bennu's equator, which might be explained by processes such as compaction or strength sorting during mass movement, but these explanations are not wholly consistent with other data. Our findings imply that other C-complex NEAs likely have boulders similar to those on Bennu rather than finer-particulate regoliths.

Moreover, impacting planetesimals are now assumed to be too small to cause melting and differentiation and thus their materials are stored in the crystalline upper mantle of the growing planet until a hydrostatically relaxed global magma ocean forms in the aftermath of a giant impact, whose depth is also estimated from Nakajima et al.

Here, and in our companion paper (Cambioni et al. 2019) that introduces the training methodology, we demonstrate the first application of machine learning to more realistically model the late stage of planet formation by giant impacts. We present surrogate models that give fast, reliable answers for the masses and velocities of the two largest remnants of a giant impact, as a function of the colliding masses and their impact velocity and angle, with the caveat that our training data do not yet include pre-impact rotation or variable thermal conditions. We compare canonical N-body scenarios of terrestrial planet formation assuming perfect merger (Chambers 2001) with our more realistic treatment that includes inefficient accretions and hit-and-run collisions. The result is a<sep>Some active asteroids have been proposed to be formed as a result of impact events1. Because active asteroids are generally discovered by chance only after their tails have fully formed, the process of how impact ejecta evolve into a tail has, to our knowledge, not been directly observed.

Motivated by this, here we fit a model to the same ALMA data set that allows dielectric constant and thermal inertia to vary across the surface. We find that Psyche has a heterogeneous surface in both dielectric constant and thermal inertia but, intriguingly, we do not observe a direct correlation between these<sep>Planets are expected to conclude their growth through a series of giant impacts: energetic, global events that significantly alter planetary composition and evolution. Computer models and theory have elucidated the diverse outcomes of giant impacts in detail, improving our ability to interpret collision conditions from observations of their remnants. However, many open questions remain, as even the formation of the Moon—a widely suspected giant-impact product for which we have the most information—is still debated. We review giant-impact theory, the diverse nature of giant-impact outcomes, and the governing physical processes. We discuss the importance of computer simulations, informed by experiments, for accurately modeling the impact process. Finally, we outline how the application of probability theory and computational advancements can assist in inferring collision histories from observations, and we identify promising opportunities for advancing giant-impact theory in the future. ▪ Giant<sep>Spacecraft missions have observed regolith blankets of unconsolidated subcentimetre particles on stony asteroids1–3. Telescopic data have suggested the presence of regolith blankets also on carbonaceous asteroids, including (101955) Bennu4 and (162173) Ryugu5. However, despite observations of processes that are capable of comminuting boulders into unconsolidated materials, such as meteoroid bombardment6,7 and thermal cracking8, Bennu and Ryugu lack extensive areas covered in subcentimetre particles7,9. Here we report an inverse correlation between the local abundance of subcentimetre particles and the porosity of rocks on Bennu. We interpret this finding to mean that accumulation of unconsolidated subcentimetre particles is frustrated where the rocks are highly porous, which appears to be most of the surface10. The highly porous rocks are compressed rather than fragmented by meteoroid impacts, consistent with laboratory experiments11,12, and thermal cracking proceeds more slowly than in denser rocks.

A test of kinetic impact technology was identified as the highest-priority space mission related to asteroid mitigation 1 . NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is a full-scale test of kinetic impact technology. The mission’s target asteroid was Dimorphos, the secondary member of the S-type binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos.

Simulations show that this produces a hot, high angular momentum, silicate-dominated protolunar system, in substantial agreement with lunar geology, geochemistry, and dynamics. However, a Moon that derives mostly from Theia's mantle, as angular momentum dictates, is challenged by the fact that O, Ti, Cr, radiogenic W, and other elements are indistinguishable in Earth and lunar rocks.

We survey all the features previously reported to exist, tentatively identify several new features, and produce a global map of Psyche. Using 30 calibrated radar echoes, we find Psyche's overall radar albedo to be 0.34 +/- 0.08 suggesting that the upper meter of regolith has a significant metal (i.e., Fe-Ni) content.

Hence, their realistic treatment in N -body studies is critical to accurately model the formation of terrestrial planets and to develop interpretations of telescopic and spacecraft observations. In this work, we compare the effects of two collision prescriptions on the core−mantle differentiation of terrestrial planets: a model in which collisions are always completely accretionary (“perfect merging”), and a more realistic model based on neural networks that has been trained on hydrodynamical simulations of giant impacts. The latter model is able to predict the loss of mass due to imperfect accretion and the evolution of nonaccreted projectiles in hit-and-run collisions.

The discovery of hot super-Earths - a high temperature, short-period subset of the super-Earth planet population - has presented many unresolved questions concerning the formation, evolution, and composition of rocky planets. We report the discovery of a transiting, ultra-short period hot super-Earth orbiting TOI-1075 (TIC 351601843), a nearby ($d$ = 61.4 pc) late K-/early M-dwarf star, using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).

Our radial velocity<sep>During the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, hit-and-run collisions are about as common as accretionary mergers, for expected velocities and angles of giant impacts. Average hit-and-runs leave two major remnants plus debris: the target and impactor, somewhat modified through erosion, escaping at lower relative velocity. Here we continue our study of the dynamical effects of such collisions. We compare the dynamical fates of intact runners that start from hit-and-runs with proto-Venus at 0.7 AU and proto-Earth at 1.0 AU. We follow the orbital evolutions of the runners, including the other terrestrial planets, Jupiter, and Saturn, in an N-body code. We find that the accretion of these runners can take $\\gtrsim$10 Myr (depending on the egress velocity of the first collision) and can involve successive collisions with the original target planet or with other planets.

Results from the hypervelocity kinetic impact and Earth-based observations, coupled with LICIACube and the later Hera mission, will result in measurement of the momentum transfer efficiency accurate to ~10% and characterization of the Didymos binary system. But DART is a single experiment; how could these results be used in a future planetary defense necessity involving a different asteroid? We examine what aspects of Dimorphos's response to kinetic impact will be constrained by DART results; how these constraints will help refine knowledge of the physical properties of asteroidal materials and predictive power of impact simulations; what information about a potential Earth impactor could be acquired before a deflection effort; and how design of a deflection mission should be informed by this understanding.

We apply a Kolmogorov-Smirnov similarity test to OVIRS spectra of Bennu and laboratory spectra of minerals to categorize 3.4-μm features observed on Bennu as representing either carbonates or organics. Among the 15,585 spectra acquired by OVIRS during high-resolution (4 to 9 m/spectrum footprint) reconnaissance observations of select locations on Bennu's surface, we find 544 spectral matches with carbonates and 245 spectral matches with organics (total of 789 high-confidence spectral matches). We map the locations of these matches and characterize features of Bennu's surface using corresponding image data. Image data are used to quantitatively characterize the albedo within each spectrometer footprint. We find no apparent relationships between<sep>Abstract NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) is the first full-scale test of an asteroid deflection technology. Results from the hypervelocity kinetic impact and Earth-based observations, coupled with LICIACube and the later Hera mission, will result in measurement of the momentum transfer efficiency accurate to ∼10% and characterization of the Didymos binary system. But DART is a single experiment; how could these results be used in a future planetary defense necessity involving a different asteroid? We examine what aspects of Dimorphos’s response to kinetic impact will be constrained by DART results; how these constraints will help refine knowledge of the physical properties of asteroidal materials and predictive power of impact simulations; what information about a potential Earth impactor could be acquired before a deflection effort; and how design of a deflection mission should be informed by this understanding. We<sep>We present a new method for the determination of the surface properties of airless bodies from measurements of the emitted infrared flux. Our approach uses machine learning techniques to train, validate, and test a neural network representation of the thermophysical behavior of the atmosphereless body given shape model, illumination and observational geometry of the remote sensors. The networks are trained on a dataset of thermal simulations of the emitted infrared flux for different values of surface rock abundance, roughness, and values of the thermal inertia of the regolith and of the rock components. These surrogate models are then employed to retrieve the surface thermal properties by Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian inversion of observed infrared fluxes. We apply the method to the inversion of simulated infrared fluxes of asteroid (101195) Bennu – according to a geometry of observations similar<sep>Abstract Populating the exoplanet mass–radius diagram in order to identify the underlying relationship that governs planet composition is driving an interdisciplinary effort within the exoplanet community.

Selecting a sample collection site on Bennu's surface was challenging due to the surprising lack of large ponded deposits of regolith particles exclusively fine enough ( ≤2cm diameter) to be ingested by the spacecraft's Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM). Here we describe the Sampleability Map of Bennu, which was constructed to aid in the selection of candidate sampling sites and to estimate the probability of collecting sufficient sample. \"Sampleability\" is a numeric score that expresses the compatibility of a given area's surface properties with the sampling mechanism. The algorithm that determines sampleability is a best fit functional form to an extensive suite of laboratory testing outcomes tracking the TAGSAM performance</abstract>", "<keyword>Stability (learning theory)<sep>Automatic frequency control<sep>Blade (archaeology)<sep>Smart grid<sep>Grid<sep>Gas compressor<sep>Control (management)<sep>Deflection (physics)<sep>Limiting<sep>Dynamics (music)<sep>Mechanism (biology)<sep>Actuator<sep>Voltage<sep>Finite element method<sep>Electric power system<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Robot<sep>Crank<sep>Asynchrony (computer programming)<sep>Electrical network<sep>Vibration<sep>Control theory (sociology)<sep>Asynchronous communication<sep>Turbomachinery<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Expression (computer science)<sep>Signal processing<sep>SIGNAL (programming language)</keyword><title>Secondary frequency control stabilising voltage dynamics<sep>Secondary frequency control stabilizing voltage dynamics<sep>Secondary frequency control stabilizing voltage dynamics.<sep>Construction of the Signal Profile for Use in Blade Tip-Timing Analysis<sep>Effects of demand control on the complex dynamics of electric power system blackouts<sep>Optimizing probes positioning in Blade Tip Timing systems<sep>Reduction of power grid fluctuations by communication between smart devices<sep>Experimental validation of FEM-computed stress to tip deflection ratios of aero-engine compressor blade vibration modes and quantification of associated uncertainties<sep>A Multifunction Robot Based on the Slider-Crank Mechanism: Dynamics and Optimal Configuration for Energy Harvesting</title><abstract>The ongoing energy transition challenges the stability of the electrical power system. Stable operation of the electrical power grid requires both the voltage (amplitude) and the frequency to stay within operational bounds. While much research has focused on frequency dynamics and stability, the voltage dynamics has been neglected. Here, we study frequency and voltage stability in the case of simple networks via linear stability and bulk analysis. In particular, our linear stability analysis of the network shows that the frequency secondary control guarantees the stability of a particular electric network. Even more interesting, while we only consider secondary frequency control, we observe a stabilising effect on the voltage dynamics, especially in our numerical bulk analysis.<sep>The ongoing energy transition challenges the stability of the electrical power system.

New innovative approach is based on the precise separation of measured data that was published in previous works. In this respect, the construction of the signal profile is intended for fast and accurate definition of the regulation function served to expression of the complete speed fluctuation and its instabilities. Following, the presented signal profile is demonstrated on four variants of data processing in two significantly different operations, where it allows the application of a one-step approach. Finally, these results are also compared with a two-step method used in previous cases without the signal profile. The benefit of the suggested procedure of the signal profile calculation is evident in the possibility of processing more complex functions in deterministic methods without limiting the characteristic advantages of these methods.<sep>The propagation of failures and blackouts in electric networks is a complex problem. Typical models, such as the ORNL-PSerc-Alaska (OPA), are based on a combination of fast and slow dynamics. The first describes the cascading failures while the second describes the grid evolution through line and generation upgrades as well as demand growth, all taking place in time scales from days to years. The growing integration of renewable energy sources, whose power fluctuates in time scales from seconds to hours, together with the increase in demand, which also presents fast fluctuations, requires the incorporation of distributed methods of control in the demand side to avoid the high cost of ordinary control in conventional power plants. In this work, we extend the OPA model to include fluctuations in the demand at time scales of the order of minutes, intraday demand variations, and the effect of demand control. We find that demand control effectively reduces the number of blackouts without increasing the probability of large-scale events.<sep>The monitoring of the blades in bladed disk assembly is done via a continuous determination and analysis of the blade dynamics, which is mostly subjected to different type of excitation forces inducing the synchronous and asynchronous vibration of the blades. These vibrations can cause fatigue and crack of the blade, which can damage the overall turbo-machinery. Thus, avoiding such a damage motivates the determination of the blade’s vibration. Which is done traditionally by the used of strain gauge, which unfortunately monitor only the instrumented blade but not all the blade at the same time. Nowadays, such vibration measurements are done by Blade Tip Timing (BTT) system, where the arrangement of the probe is extremely important in order to extract useful information of the blade’s vibration signal. Thus, this article proposes a simple approach for the determination of the optimal probe positioning based on the minimization of the coherence of the measurement matrix derived from the mathematical model used to infer the vibration parameters, while the blade exhibits synchronous and asynchronous vibrations.<sep>The increase of the electric demand and the progressive integration of renewable energy sources threatens the stability of the power grid. To solve this issue, several methods have been proposed to control the demand side instead of increasing the spinning reserve in the supply. Here we focus on dynamic demand control (DDC), a method in which smart devices can autonomously delay its scheduled operation if the electric frequency is outside a suitable range. While typical control schemes can effectively reduce small and medium size frequency fluctuations, the probability of large demand peaks, and hence large frequency fluctuation, may increase due to the need of recovering pending tasks. Although these events are rare they can potentially trigger a failure of the system and therefore strategies to avoid them need to be addressed. In this work we introduce a method including communication among DDC devices belonging to a given group, such that they can coordinate opposite actions to keep the group demand more stable. We show that, with minimal information exchange, our method reduces the amount of pending tasks by a factor 10 while large frequency fluctuations are significantly reduced or even completely avoided.<sep>Blade Tip Timing (BTT) technology is concerned with the estimation of turbomachinery blade stresses. The stresses are determined from BTT data by relating the measured tip deflection to the stresses via Finite Element (FE) models. The correlation of BTT measurements with FE predictions involves a number of uncertainties. This paper presents the process for validating the FE stress and deflection predictions of aero-engine compressor blades under non-rotation conditions as a critical preliminary step towards the complete understanding of their dynamic behaviour under rotating conditions when using BTT measurements. The process steps are described in detail, including the FE modelling and analysis of the blades and the blade-disk assembly, and the measurements of the blade tip deflection and blade stress. Furthermore, the uncertainties associated with the FE modelling and the measurement processes are quantified. The results show that the FE model is valid considering the control of most uncertainties. The experimental validation of the FE-computed stress-to-tip deflection calibration factors in the present study provides the basis for the determination of the calibration factors under rotational conditions using a previously presented BTT data simulator, and for the design of corresponding rotating experiments using BTT.<sep>An electromechanical robot based on the modified slider-crank mechanism with a damped spring hung at its plate terminal is investigated. The robot is first used for actuation operation and for energy harvesting purposes thereafter. Mathematical modeling in both cases is proposed. As an actuator, the robot is powered with a DC motor, and the effect of the voltage supply on the whole system dynamics is found out. From the numerical simulation based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm, results show various dynamics of the subsystems, including periodicity, multi-periodicity, and chaos as depicted by the bifurcation diagrams. Applications can be found in industrial processes like sieving, shaking, cutting, pushing, crushing, or grinding. Regarding the case of the robot functioning as an energy harvester, two different configurations of the electrical circuit for both single and double loops are set up. The challenge is to determine the best configuration for the high performance of the harvester. It comes from theoretical predictions and experimental data that the efficiency of the robot depends on the range values of the electrical load resistance RL. The double loop circuit is preferable for the low values of RL50 Ohm) while the single loop is convenient for high values of RL ≥ 50 Ohm.</abstract>", "<keyword>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors<sep>Transparency (behavior)<sep>Blockchain<sep>Foundation (evidence)<sep>Identifier<sep>Scalability<sep>Recommender system<sep>The Internet<sep>Demand side<sep>Lanosterol<sep>Verifiable secret sharing<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Antigen<sep>Inclusion (mineral)<sep>Quantum<sep>Ubiquitin ligase<sep>Usability<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Glutathione<sep>Bacteria<sep>Ensemble learning<sep>Chloroplast<sep>Antidepressant<sep>Glycoprotein<sep>Random forest<sep>Matrix (chemical analysis)<sep>Hermitian matrix<sep>Biosynthesis<sep>Interferon<sep>Outcome (game theory)<sep>HEK 293 cells<sep>Tricyclic<sep>C-type lectin<sep>Task (project management)<sep>Mucin<sep>Antiviral protein<sep>Software<sep>Feature selection<sep>Plasma protein binding<sep>Transferase<sep>Boosting (machine learning)<sep>Amitriptyline<sep>Complex system<sep>Qualitative research<sep>Classifier (UML)<sep>Tricyclic antidepressant<sep>Glycosyltransferase<sep>Predictive analytics<sep>Nucleotide sugar<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Identification (biology)<sep>Pattern recognition (psychology)<sep>Squalene monooxygenase<sep>Galactorrhea<sep>Supply side<sep>Random matrix<sep>Endoplasmic reticulum<sep>Lectin<sep>Glycan<sep>Subject (documents)<sep>Biofilm<sep>Virus<sep>Subcellular localization<sep>Cloud computing<sep>Sampling (signal processing)<sep>Mannan-binding lectin<sep>Viral protein<sep>NS5A<sep>Gradient boosting<sep>Hepatitis C virus<sep>Ubiquitin<sep>RNA<sep>Nonlinear dimensionality reduction<sep>Homeostasis<sep>Conviction<sep>Sterol<sep>Purchasing<sep>Transfection<sep>Hermitian function<sep>Financial inclusion<sep>Benchmarking<sep>Software bug<sep>Ficolin<sep>Mutant<sep>Manifold (fluid mechanics)<sep>Bacillus subtilis<sep>Lipid raft<sep>Nonlinear system<sep>Viral replication<sep>Signal transduction</keyword><title>Defining early steps in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm biosynthesis<sep>Amitriptyline induced Galactorrhea: A case report<sep>Financial Inclusion in India: A Giant Structure on Weak Foundation<sep>Lectin-Seq: A method to profile lectin-microbe interactions in native communities<sep>A benchmarking framework using nonlinear manifold detection techniques for software defect prediction<sep>A Predictive Analysis Model of Customer Purchase Behavior using Modified Random Forest Algorithm in Cloud Environment<sep>A statistical comparison for evaluating the effectiveness of linear and nonlinear manifold detection techniques for software defect prediction<sep>Statistical assessment of nonlinear manifold detection-based software defect prediction techniques<sep>Evaluating the Impact of Sampling-Based Nonlinear Manifold Detection Model on Software Defect Prediction Problem<sep>Engineered Glycan-Binding Proteins for Recognition of the Thomsen–Friedenreich Antigen and Structurally Related Disaccharides<sep>Spectral Properties of Disordered Interacting Non-Hermitian Systems<sep>The Interaction of Viperin with Hepatitis C Virus Non-Structural Protein 5A Inhibits the Catalytic Activity of Viperin<sep>An Efficient Predictive Analysis Model of Customer Purchase Behavior using Random Forest and XGBoost Algorithm<sep>Interactions between Viperin, Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein A, and Hepatitis C Virus Protein NS5A Modulate Viperin Activity and NS5A Degradation<sep>Glutathione regulates transcriptional activation of iron transporters via <i>S</i>‐nitrosylation of bHLH factors to modulate subcellular iron homoeostasis<sep>Eigenvector Correlations Across the Localisation Transition in\n  non-Hermitian Power-Law Banded Random Matrices<sep>Viperin inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis and interacts with enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway<sep>A Comparative Analysis of Potential Factors and Impacts that Affect Blockchain Technology in Software: Based Applications<sep>Human oral lectin ZG16B acts as a cell wall polysaccharide probe to decode host–microbe interactions with oral commensals<sep>Glutathione regulates subcellular iron homeostasis via transcriptional activation of iron responsive genes in Arabidopsis<sep>The antiviral enzyme viperin inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis<sep>Defining Early Steps in<i>B. subtilis</i>Biofilm Biosynthesis<sep>Research Methodology (A Guide for Scholars)<sep>A Comprehensive Survey of Personalized Music Identifier System<sep>Viperin interacts with the kinase IRAK1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, coupling innate immune signaling to antiviral ribonucleotide synthesis</title><abstract>Biofilms are the communal way of life that microbes adopt to increase survival.

The paper also examines the comprehensiveness of existing indicators of financial inclusion in India.<sep>Soluble human lectins are critical components of innate immunity. Genetic models suggest that lectins influence host-resident microbiota, but their specificity for commensal and mutualist species is understudied. Elucidating lectins' roles in regulating microbiota requires an understanding of which microbial species they bind within native communities. To profile human lectin recognition, we developed Lectin-Seq. We apply Lectin-Seq to human fecal microbiota using the soluble mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and intelectin-1 (hItln1). Although each lectin binds a substantial percentage of the samples (10 to 20%), the microbial interactomes of MBL and hItln1 differ markedly in composition and diversity. MBL binding is highly selective for a small subset of species commonly associated with humans. In contrast, hItln1's interaction profile encompasses a broad range of lower-abundance species. Our data uncover stark differences in the commensal recognition properties of human lectins.<sep>Prediction of software defects in time improves quality and helps in locating the defect-prone areas accurately. Although earlier considerable methods were applied, actually none of those measures was found to be fool-proof and accurate. Hence, a newer framework includes nonlinear manifold detection model, and its algorithm originated for defect prediction using different techniques of nonlinear manifold detection (nonlinear MDs) along with 14 different machine learning techniques (MLTs) on eight defective software datasets. A critical analysis cum exhaustive comparative estimation revealed that nonlinear manifold detection model has a more accurate and effective impact on defect prediction as compared to feature selection techniques. The outcome of the experiment was statistically tested by Friedman and post hoc analysis using Nemenyi test, which validates that hidden Markov model (HMM) along with nonlinear manifold detection model outperforms and is significantly different from MLTs.<sep>Prediction analysis of customer purchase behavior is an interesting and challenging task in modern-day life. Our objective is to introduce the concept of machine learning using a random forest algorithm in depth. In this paper, a model has been proposed for predicting which cloud services have been purchased on a number of factors. A random forest model is built using different parameters such as advertisement click sequence, previously purchased cloud services, etc. and training our model. For the execution of this proposed model, an advertisement log dataset has been taken and the necessary modifications have been done on it. As an outcome, for a customer, this proposed model is providing high accuracy in prediction. Five factors have been considered which affect purchasing decision-making of customers in cloud services, such as previous purchasing habits, a sequence of advertisements viewed, customer location, etc..<sep>Most of the software systems are released without predicting defects and therefore, this paper presents a new effective technique - manifold detection technique (MDT) is essential and different than earlier applied defect prediction methods like regression, feature selection methods, etc. In this paper, performance of classifiers has been compared with or without MDTs to evaluate the effectiveness of different MDTs (linear and nonlinear) by reducing the dimensions of software datasets. In this process, eight classifiers were applied to four PROMISE datasets to determine the best performing classifier with respect to prediction performance measuring factors (accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, AUC, misclassification error) with or without MDTs. The experimental results statistically tested by paired two-tailed t-test proved that FastMVU is the most accurate result producing technique as compared to all other nonlinear MDTs and Bayesian network (BN) is the most effective technique for software defect prediction using with or without MDTs.<sep>Prediction of software defects has immense importance for obtaining desired outcome at minimised cost and so attracted researchers working on this topic applying various techniques, which were not found fully effective. Software datasets comprise of redundant features that hinder effective application of techniques resulting inappropriate defect prediction. Hence, it requires newer application of nonlinear manifold detection techniques (nonlinear MDTs) that has been examined for accurate prediction of defects at lesser time and cost using different classification techniques. In this work, we analysed and tested the effect of nonlinear MDTs to find out accurate and best classification technique for all datasets. Comparison has been made between the results of without or with nonlinear MDTs and paired two-tailed T-test has been performed for statistical testing and verifying the performance of classifiers using nonlinear MDTs on all datasets. Outcome revealed that among all nonlinear MDTs, FastMVU makes most accurate prediction of software defects.<sep>Accurate prediction of defects is considered an essential factor, depending mainly on how efficiently testing of different prediction models has been done. Earlier, most of the models were restricted to the use of feature selection methods that had limited effects in solving this problem in initial stage of software development. To overcome it, the application of software defect prediction model using modern nonlinear manifold detection (nonlinear MD) combined with SMOTE using four machine learning classification approaches has been proposed in a way that the challenging task of defect prediction has been categorized as problem of high-dimensional datasets, problem of imbalanced class, and identification of most relevant and effective software attributes. Then, statistically evaluated and compared performance of prediction model with or without SMOTE-nonlinear MD approaches and results validated that proposed SMOTE-nonlinear MD approach prediction model predicts defect with better accuracy than others using RMSE, accuracy, and area under the curve.<sep>Glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) are widely used reagents for basic research and clinical applications. These reagents allow for the identification and manipulation of glycan determinants without specialized equipment or time-consuming experimental methods. Existing GBPs, mainly antibodies and lectins, are limited, and discovery or creation of reagents with novel specificities is time consuming and difficult. Here, we detail the generation of GBPs from a small, hyper-thermostable DNA-binding protein by directed evolution. Yeast surface display of a variable library of rcSso7d proteins was screened to find variants with selectivity toward the cancer-associated glycan Galβ1–3GalNAcα or Thomsen–Friedenreich antigen and various relevant disaccharides. Characterization of these proteins shows them to have specificities and affinities on par with currently available lectins. The proteins can be readily functionalized with fluorophores or biotin using sortase-mediated ligation to create reagents that prove useful for glycoprotein blotting and cell staining applications. The presented methods for the development of GBPs toward specific saccharides of interest will have<sep>Non-hermitian systems have gained a lot of interest in recent years. However, notions of chaos and localization in such systems have not reached the same level of maturity as in the Hermitian systems. Here, we consider non-hermitian interacting disordered Hamiltonians and attempt to analyze their chaotic behavior or lack of it through the lens of the recently introduced non-hermitian analog of the spectral form factor and the complex spacing ratio. We consider three widely relevant non-hermitian models which are unique in their ways and serve as excellent platforms for such investigations. Two of the models considered are short-ranged and have different symmetries. The third model is long-ranged, whose hermitian counterpart has itself become a subject of growing interest. All these models exhibit a deep connection with the non-hermitian Random Matrix Theory of corresponding symmetry classes at relatively weak disorder. At relatively strong disorder, the models show the absence of complex eigenvalue correlation, thereby, corresponding to Poisson<sep>Abstract The radical SAM enzyme viperin exerts a wide range of antiviral effects through both the synthesis of the antiviral nucleotide 3’-deoxy-3’, 4’-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) and through its interactions with various cellular and viral proteins. Here we investigate the interaction of viperin with hepatitis C virus non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) and the host sterol regulatory protein, vesicle-associated membrane protein A (VAP-33). NS5A and VAP-33 form part of the viral replication complex that is essential for copying the RNA genome of the virus. Using transfected enzymes in HEK293T cells, we show that viperin binds to both NS5A and VAP-33 independently and that this interaction is dependent on all three proteins being localized to the ER membrane. Co-expression of viperin with VAP-33 and NS5A was found to reduce NS5A levels, most likely by increasing the rate of proteasomal degradation. However, co-expression of viperin with VAP-33 and NS5A also reduces the specific activity of viperin by ~ 3-fold. This observation<sep>Predictive Analytics is a bough of the advanced analytics which has been used to make predictions about unknown future events.

Coexpression of VAP-33C and NS5A resulted in changes to the catalytic activity of viperin that depended upon viperin being colocalized to the ER membrane. The viperin-NS5A-VAP-33C complex exhibited the lowest specific activity, indicating that NS5A may inhibit viperin's<sep>Glutathione (GSH) is known to regulate iron (Fe) deficiency response in plants but its involvement in modulating subcellular Fe homoeostasis remains elusive. In this study, we report that the GSH-deficient mutants, cad2-1 and pad2-1 displayed increased sensitivity to Fe deficiency with significant downregulation of the vacuolar Fe exporters, AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4, and the chloroplast Fe importer, AtPIC1. Moreover, the pad2-1 mutant accumulated higher Fe levels in vacuoles but lower Fe levels in chloroplasts compared to wild type (Columbia ecotype [Col-0]) under Fe limited conditions. Exogenous GSH treatment enhanced chloroplast Fe contents in Col-0 but failed to do so in the nramp3nramp4 double mutants demonstrating that GSH plays a role in modulating subcellular Fe homoeostasis. Pharmacological experiments, mutant analysis, and promoter assays revealed that this regulation involves the transcriptional activation of Fe transporter genes by a GSH-S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) module. The Fe responsive bHLH transcription factors (TFs), AtbHLH29, AtbHLH38, and AtbHLH101 were found to interact with the promoters<sep>The dynamics of non-Hermitian quantum systems have taken on an increasing relevance in light of quantum devices which are not perfectly isolated from their environment. The interest in them also stems from their fundamental differences from their Hermitian counterparts, particularly with regard to their spectral and eigenvector correlations. These correlations form the fundamental building block for understanding the dynamics of quantum systems as all other correlations can be reconstructed from it. In this work, we study such correlations across a localisation transition in non-Hermitian quantum systems. As a concrete setting, we consider non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices which have emerged as a promising platform for studying localisation in disordered, non-Hermitian systems. We show that eigenvector correlations show marked differences between the delocalised and localised phases. In the delocalised phase, the eigenvectors are strongly correlated as evinced by divergent correlations in the limit of vanishingly small complex eigenvalue spacings. On the contrary, in the localised phase, the<sep>Abstract Many enveloped viruses bud from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts on the cell membrane. Depleting cellular cholesterol impedes this process and results in viral particles with reduced viability. Viperin (virus inhibitory protein endoplasmic reticulum-associated, interferon-induced) is an ER membrane-associated enzyme that when expressed in response to viral infections exerts broad-ranging antiviral effects, including inhibiting the budding of some enveloped viruses. Here we have investigated the effect of viperin expression on cholesterol biosynthesis. We found that viperin expression reduces cholesterol levels by 20 – 30 % in HEK293T cells. A proteomic screen of the viperin interactome identified several cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes among the top hits. The two most highly enriched proteins were lanosterol synthase and squalene monooxygenase, enzymes that catalyze key steps establishing the sterol carbon skeleton. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments established that viperin, lanosterol synthase and squalene monooxygenase form a complex at the ER membrane. Co-expression of viperin was found to significantly inhibit the specific activity of lanosterol synthase<sep>A new technology that considerably provides help in case of application of distributed ledger system by use of decentralized transactional databases is introduced as Blockchain. The functions of Blockchain can be categorized into three phases: Firstly, it emphasizes on decentralization i.e. no centralized body can dictate on other blocks. Secondly, it emphasizes on transparency i.e. easy validated transactions take place through it permits verifiable transparency in case of each mechanism. Finally, it has an immutable feature which never permits tampering of database/data as any change in data may affect or agitate the entire data-chain. For the purpose of security, the immutable pillar is basically used in this technology. In Blockchain technology, generally the peer to peer network is applied that allows new block to join in the chain without affecting all other blocks in the system. It is a well accepted view or proposition that for obtaining block chain of a high quality some basic attributes<sep>The oral microbiome is critical to human health and disease, yet the role that host salivary proteins play in maintaining oral health is unclear. A highly expressed gene in human salivary glands encodes the lectin zymogen granule protein 16 homolog B (ZG16B). Despite the abundance of this protein, its interaction partners in the oral microbiome are unknown. ZG16B possesses a lectin fold, but whether it binds carbohydrates is unclear. We postulated that ZG16B would bind microbial glycans to mediate recognition of oral microbes. To this end, we developed a microbial glycan analysis probe (mGAP) strategy based on conjugating the recombinant protein to fluorescent or biotin reporter functionality. Applying the ZG16B-mGAP to dental plaque isolates revealed that ZG16B predominantly binds to a limited set of oral microbes, including Streptococcus mitis, Gemella haemolysans, and, most prominently, Streptococcus vestibularis.

ZG16B binds to S. vestibularis through the cell wall<sep>Abstract While glutathione (GSH) is known to regulate iron (Fe) deficiency response in plants, its involvement in modulating subcellular Fe homeostasis remained elusive. In this study, we report that the GSH depleted mutants, cad2-1 and pad2-1 displayed increased sensitivity to Fe deficiency with significant down-regulation of the vacuolar Fe exporters, AtNRAMP 3 and AtNRAMP 4 and the chloroplast Fe importer, AtPIC 1. Moreover, the pad2-1 mutant accumulated higher Fe content in vacuoles and lower in chloroplasts compared with Col-0 under Fe limited condition. Exogenous GSH treatment could enhance the chloroplast Fe content in Col-0 plants but failed to do so in the nramp3nramp4 double mutant demonstrating the role of GSH in modulating subcellular Fe homeostasis. Pharmacological experiments, mutant analysis and promoter assay revealed that this regulation involved transcriptional activation of the transporter genes by a GSH-GSNO module. The Fe responsive bHLH transcription factors (TFs), At bHLH29, At bHLH38 and At bHLH101 were identified to interact with<sep>Many enveloped viruses bud from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts on the cell membrane. Depleting cellular cholesterol impedes this process and results in viral particles with reduced viability. Viperin (Virus Inhibitory Protein, Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated, Interferon iNducible) is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated enzyme that exerts broad-ranging antiviral effects, including inhibiting the budding of some enveloped viruses. However, the relationship between viperin expression and the retarded budding of virus particles from lipid rafts on the cell membrane is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of viperin expression on cholesterol biosynthesis using transiently expressed genes in the human cell line human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T). We found that viperin expression reduces cholesterol levels by 20% to 30% in these cells. Following this observation, a proteomic screen of the viperin interactome identified several cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes among the top hits, including lanosterol synthase (LS) and squalene monooxygenase (SM), which are enzymes that catalyze key steps in establishing the sterol carbon skeleton. Coimmunoprecipitation<sep>ABSTRACT The Bacillus subtilis extracellular biofilm matrix includes an exopolysaccharide that is critical for the architecture and function of the community. To date, our understanding of the biosynthetic machinery and the molecular composition of the exopolysaccharide of B. subtilis remains unclear and incomplete. This report presents synergistic biochemical and genetic studies built from a foundation of comparative sequence analyses targeted at elucidating the activities of the first two membrane-committed steps in the exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway. By taking this approach, we determined the nucleotide sugar donor and lipid-linked acceptor substrates for the first two enzymes in the B. subtilis biofilm exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway. EpsL catalyzes the first phosphoglycosyl transferase step using UDP-di- N -acetyl bacillosamine as phospho-sugar donor. EpsD is a GT-B fold glycosyl transferase that facilitates the second step in the pathway that utilizes the product of EpsL as an acceptor substrate and UDP- N -acetyl glucosamine as the sugar donor. Thus, the study defines the<sep>This book is based upon my experiences in research as a student, practitioner and teacher. The difficulties I faced in understanding research as a student, my discoveries about what was applicable and inapplicable in the field as a practitioner, and my development of the ability effectively to communicate difficult concepts in simple language without sacrificing technicality and accuracy as a teacher have become the basis of this book. Research methodology is taught as a supporting subject in several ways in many academic disciplines such as health, education, psychology, social work, nursing, public health, library studies and marketing research. The core philosophical base for this book comes from my conviction that, although these disciplines vary in content, their broad approach to a research enquiry is similar. This book, therefore, is addressed to these academic disciplines. It is true that some disciplines place greater emphasis on quantitative research and some on qualitative research. My own approach to research<sep>Music occupies a very important space in the heart and life of common people and it is rather subjective and universal nature indeed. Music Identifier System is obviously concerned with providing a very meaningful and personalized recommendation of items i.e. songs, music, playlist according to the mood, emotion, interest and preference of the users or listeners. With the advancement of technologies, rapid development of internet, it has become very common to use the streaming services to listen and enjoy music or songs in more convenient ways. In this paper, an attempt has been made to perform a comparative analysis, systematic research, empirical thorough review on various approaches or strategies proposed and applied by different researchers in the task of designing an effective system for music identification or recommendation. The basic theme of the paper includes music identifier system, its components, and different features along with emphasize on the methods, metrics, general framework and state-of-art strategies proposed<sep>Virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, interferon-inducible (viperin) is a radical SAM enzyme that plays a multifaceted role in the cellular antiviral response. Viperin has recently been shown to catalyze the SAM-dependent formation of 3′-deoxy-3′,4′-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP), which inhibits some viral RNA polymerases. Viperin is also implicated in regulating Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1) by the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) as part of the Toll-like receptor-7 and -9 (TLR7/9) innate immune signaling pathways. In these pathways, the poly-ubiquitination of IRAK1 by TRAF6 is necessary to activate IRAK1, which then phosphorylates downstream targets and ultimately leads to the production of type I interferons. That viperin is a component of these pathways suggested that its enzymatic activity might be regulated by interactions with partner proteins. To test this idea, we have reconstituted the interactions between viperin, IRAK1, and TRAF6 by transiently expressing these enzymes in HEK 293T cells. We show that IRAK1 and</abstract>", "<keyword>Guide RNA<sep>Workflow<sep>Indel<sep>CRISPR<sep>R gene<sep>Identification (biology)<sep>Genome editing<sep>In silico<sep>Metabolic engineering<sep>Outcrossing<sep>High-throughput screening<sep>Immune system<sep>Hybrid seed<sep>Sterility<sep>Mutant<sep>Lipid metabolism<sep>Effector<sep>Protoplast<sep>Heterosis<sep>Peptide sequence<sep>Gene<sep>Virulence</keyword><title>Pooled effector library screening in protoplasts rapidly identifies novel<i>Avr</i>genes<sep>Pooled effector library screening in protoplasts rapidly identifies novel Avr genes<sep><scp>CRISPR</scp>/Cas9‐mediated knockout of <i>Ms1</i> enables the rapid generation of male‐sterile hexaploid wheat lines for use in hybrid seed production<sep>AvrSr27 is a zinc-bound effector with a modular structure important for immune recognition<sep>A Versatile High Throughput Screening Platform for Plant Metabolic Engineering Highlights the Major Role of ABI3 in Lipid Metabolism Regulation<sep>A versatile high throughput screening platform for plant metabolic engineering highlights the major role of <i>ABI3</i> in lipid metabolism regulation<sep>gRNA validation for wheat genome editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system</title><abstract>Abstract Crop breeding for durable disease resistance is challenging due to the rapid evolution of pathogen virulence. While progress in resistance ( R ) gene cloning and stacking has accelerated in recent years 1-3 , the identification of corresponding avirulence ( Avr ) genes in many pathogens is hampered by the lack of high-throughput screening options. To address this technology gap, we developed a platform for pooled library screening in plant protoplasts for rapid identification of interacting R / Avr pairs. We validated this platform by isolating known and novel Avr genes from wheat stem rust ( Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ) by screening a designed library of putative effectors against individual R genes. Rapid Avr gene identification provides molecular tools to understand and track pathogen virulence evolution by genotype surveillance and optimise R gene deployment and stacking strategies. This screening platform is broadly applicable to many crop pathogens, whilst also adaptable for screening genes involved in other protoplast-selectable traits.<sep>Abstract Crop breeding for durable disease resistance is challenging due to the rapid evolution of pathogen virulence.

However, it has been a challenge to develop a commercially viable platform for the production of hybrid wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) seed due to wheat's strong inbreeding habit. Recently, a novel platform for commercial hybrid seed production was described. This hybridization platform utilizes nuclear male sterility to force outcrossing and has been applied to maize and rice. With the recent molecular identification of the wheat male fertility gene Ms1 , it is now possible to extend the use of this novel hybridization platform to wheat. In this report, we used the CRISPR /Cas9 system to generate heritable, targeted mutations in Ms1 . The introduction of biallelic frameshift mutations into Ms1 resulted in complete male sterility in wheat cultivars Fielder and Gladius, and several of the selected male‐sterile lines were potentially non‐transgenic. Our study demonstrates the utility of the CRISPR /Cas9 system for the rapid generation of male sterility in commercial wheat cultivars. This represents an important step towards capturing heterosis to improve wheat yields, through the production and use of hybrid seed on an industrial scale.<sep>Abstract Stem rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp.tritici ( Pgt ) is a major threat for wheat production and global food security. Central to the success of Pgt is the secretion of proteinaceous effectors that promote infection and colonisation, while immunity in wheat is driven by receptor-mediated recognition of these effectors resulting in pathogen avirulence. Here, we report the crystal structure of the cysteine-rich effector AvrSr27, the third experimentally derived structure of a Pgt effector. The AvrSr27 structure reveals a novel β-strand rich modular fold consisting of two structurally similar domains and confirms the poor prediction we obtained from the AlphaFold2-derived model. The highly prevalent cysteine residues within the protein facilitate the co-ordination of 4 zinc molecules. Utilising the structure, we show that the N-terminal domain of AvrSr27 is sufficient for immune recognition and interaction by Sr27. The 7-cys motif sequence in each AvrSr27 domain, which facilitates zinc binding, was also found in two haustorially-expressed, structurally homologous Pgt proteins. Remarkably, despite relatively low sequence identity, we show that these proteins can associate with Sr27 and trigger cell death in heterologous systems and wheat protoplasts, albeit weaker than AvrSr27. Collectively, our findings have important implications for the field embarking on bespoke engineering of immunity receptors as solutions to plant disease.<sep>Traditional functional genetic studies in crops are time-consuming, complicated and cannot be readily scaled up. The reason is that mutant or transformed crops need to be generated to study the effect of gene modifications on specific traits of interest. However, many crop species have a complex genome and a long generation time. As a result, it usually takes several months to over a year to obtain desired mutants or transgenic plants, which represents a significant bottleneck in the development of new crop varieties. To overcome this major issue, we are currently establishing a versatile plant genetic screening platform, amenable to high throughput screening in almost any crop species, with a unique workflow. This platform combines protoplast transformation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Here we show that tobacco protoplasts can accumulate high levels of lipids if transiently transformed with genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and can be sorted based on lipid content. Hence, protoplasts can be used as a predictive tool for plant lipid engineering. Using this newly established strategy, we demonstrate the major role of ABI3 in plant lipid accumulation. We anticipate that this workflow can be applied to numerous highly valuable metabolic traits other than storage lipid accumulation. This new strategy represents a significant step towards screening complex genetic libraries, in a single experiment and in a matter of days, as opposed to years by conventional means.<sep>Abstract Traditional functional genetic studies in crops are time-consuming, complicated and cannot be readily scaled up.

However, achieving highly efficient and specific editing in polyploid species can be a challenge. The efficiency and specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system depends critically on the gRNA used. Here, we assessed the activities and specificities of seven gRNAs targeting 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase ( EPSPS ) in hexaploid wheat protoplasts. EPSPS is the biological target of the widely used herbicide glyphosate. Results The seven gRNAs differed substantially in their on-target activities, with mean indel frequencies ranging from 0% to approximately 20%. There was no obvious correlation between experimentally determined and in silico predicted on-target gRNA activity. The presence of a single mismatch within the seed region of the guide sequence greatly reduced but did not abolish gRNA activity, whereas the presence of an additional mismatch, or the absence of a PAM, all but abolished gRNA activity. Large insertions (≥20 bp) of DNA vector-derived sequence were detected at frequencies up to 8.5% of total indels. One of the gRNAs exhibited several properties that make it potentially suitable for the development of non-transgenic glyphosate resistant wheat. Conclusions We have established a rapid and reliable method for gRNA validation in hexaploid wheat protoplasts. The method can be used to identify gRNAs that have favourable properties. Our approach is particularly suited to polyploid species, but should be applicable to any plant species amenable to protoplast transformation.</abstract>", "<keyword>Robot hand<sep>Character (mathematics)<sep>Stability (learning theory)<sep>Citizen journalism<sep>Measure (data warehouse)<sep>Wired glove<sep>Style (visual arts)<sep>Tactile sensor<sep>Robotic hand<sep>Inductive sensor<sep>Planar<sep>Microcontroller<sep>Electromagnetic coil<sep>Magnet<sep>Action (physics)<sep>Sensor fusion<sep>Capacitive sensing<sep>Hall effect sensor<sep>Focus (optics)<sep>Pattern recognition (psychology)<sep>Software deployment<sep>Perception<sep>Ball (mathematics)<sep>Task (project management)<sep>Imitation<sep>Cluster analysis<sep>Sensitivity (control systems)<sep>Wearable computer<sep>Torque<sep>Exoskeleton<sep>GRASP<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Proximity sensor<sep>Spring (device)<sep>Convolutional neural network<sep>Robustness (evolution)<sep>Fuse (electrical)<sep>Haptic technology<sep>Electronics<sep>iCub<sep>Motion (physics)<sep>Participatory design<sep>Anime<sep>Joint (building)<sep>Robot<sep>Generalization<sep>Humanoid robot<sep>Animation<sep>Transformation (genetics)<sep>Representation (politics)<sep>Avatar<sep>Object (grammar)<sep>Slip (aerodynamics)<sep>Contact force<sep>Machine vision<sep>Electromagnet<sep>Tactile display<sep>Electromagnetic interference<sep>Soft sensor<sep>Teleoperation<sep>Current sensor<sep>Population ageing<sep>Human–robot interaction<sep>Popularity<sep>Slipping</keyword><title>Soft three-axial tactile sensors with integrated electronics for robot skin<sep>Participatory Design and Early Deployment of DarumaTO-3 Social Robot<sep>Multi-In-Hand Manipulation for 3D Tactile Based Robot Hand Using CNNLSTM<sep>Development of a small-sized 6-axis force/torque sensor for robot fingers<sep>Detection of Slip from Vision and Touch<sep>Development of Exo-Glove for Measuring 3-axis Forces Acting on the Human Finger without Obstructing Natural Human-Object Interaction<sep>A Multimodal, Adjustable Sensitivity, Digital 3-Axis Skin Sensor Module<sep>Development of a 3-axis Human Fingertip Tactile Sensor with an Ortho-Planar Spring<sep>A Soft, Distributed, Digital 3-axis Skin Sensor Employing a Hybrid Permanent-Adjustable Magnetic Field<sep>3D Tactile-Driven Two-Fingered In-Hand Manipulation with Finger-Specific CNN<sep>Development of a 3-axis Human Fingertip Tactile Sensor Based on Distributed Hall Effect Sensors<sep>From Anime To Reality: Embodying An Anime Character As A Humanoid Robot<sep>Geometric Transformation: Tactile Data Augmentation for Robotic Learning<sep>\"Safe Skin\" - A Low-Cost Capacitive Proximity-Force-Fusion Sensor for Safety in Robots<sep>Magnetic 3-axis Soft and Sensitive Fingertip Sensors Integration for the iCub Humanoid Robot<sep>SCT-CNN: A Spatio-Channel-Temporal Attention CNN for Grasp Stability Prediction<sep>Vision-Touch Fusion for Predicting Grasping Stability Using Self Attention and Past Visual Images<sep>Improvements on a Sensitivity Adjustable 3-Axis Soft Skin Sensor with an Electromagnet<sep>Stable In-Grasp Manipulation with a Low-Cost Robot Hand by Using 3-Axis Tactile Sensors with a CNN<sep>FingerTac - An Interchangeable and Wearable Tactile Sensor for the Fingertips of Human and Robot Hands<sep>FingerTac -- An Interchangeable and Wearable Tactile Sensor for the\n  Fingertips of Human and Robot Hands<sep>A Robotic Grasping State Perception Framework With Multi-Phase Tactile Information and Ensemble Learning<sep>Deep GRU-ensembles for active tactile texture recognition with soft, distributed skin sensors in dynamic contact scenarios<sep>Sequential clustering for tactile image compression to enable direct adaptive feedback<sep>Variable In-Hand Manipulations for Tactile-Driven Robot Hand via CNN-LSTM<sep>HATSUKI : An anime character like robot figure platform with anime-style\n  expressions and imitation learning based action generation<sep>HATSUKI : An anime character like robot figure platform with anime-style expressions and imitation learning based action generation<sep>Design and Development of ExoGlove for Obtaining Human Hand Data</title><abstract>This chapter introduces recent work of the Sugano lab on distributed, soft, 3-axial tactile sensors for robot skin, based on capacitive [1-3] and Hall-Effect [4-8] sensors, with distributed electronics.<sep>With the problem of ageing population increasingly prominent, the burden of families, caregivers and medical workers to take care of older adults will be heavier. Social exclusion and cognitive dysfunctions make things worse, especially in times of a pandemic. One of the most effective approaches to solve these problems can be technology, which application is often limited by the acceptance of the end user. We introduce a social robot, DarumaTO-3, whose appearance is inspired by a traditional Buddhist and Shinto doll called Daruma, and perform a preliminary test in which we hear the response from older adults. This paper describes this new robot prototype, and reports the feedback received from the early deployment with 44 Japanese older adults.<sep>Generalization to multiple in-hand manipulation tasks are difficult to realize and not well-investigated. This research studied how to generalize with task information. The Allegro Hand which has 3-dimensional distributed tactile sensors, uSkin and 6-axis F/T sensors on each fingertip was used and the abundant tactile information results in 312 (288 from uSkin and 24 from 6-axis F/T sensors) measurement. Furthermore, convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented to process the abundant tactile information which has touch states between an object and fingertips and long short-term memory (LSTM) is applied as processor of time-series information. Finally, task information is exploited for adapting to multi-in-hand manipulation tasks (pushing and twisting). As networks are combined, CNNLSTM could generate two stable in-hand manipulation with task information.<sep>In order for a robot to do the same works as a human, it is effective to reduce the size of the robot hand close to that of a human. However, existing six-axis force torque sensors in robot fingers are large in size, and usually requires extra electronics. In this study, we propose a compact 6-axis force sensor for robot fingers. The size of this sensor is close to that of a human finger, and the output is a digital value, so the sensor needs no extra electronics and less wiring. This sensor uses Hall effect sensor chips. The changes of magnetic field are detected under force and torque. We confirmed that the output of developed sensor and reference sensor are matched in evaluation experiments.<sep>Detecting the onset/ongoing of slip, i.e. if a grasped object is slipping or will slip from the gripper while being lifted, is crucial. Conventionally, it is regarded as a tactile sensing related problem. However, recently multi-modal robotic learning has become popular and is expected to boost the performance. In this paper we propose a novel CNN-TCN model to fuse tactile and visual information for detecting the onset/ongoing of slip. In our experiments, two uSkin tactile sensors and one Realsense435i camera are used. Data is collected by randomly grasping and lifting 35 daily objects 1050 times in total. Furthermore, we compare our CNN-TCN model with the widely used CNN-LSTM model. As a result, our proposed model achieves a 88.75% detection accuracy and outperforms the CNN-LSTM model combined with different pretrained vision networks.<sep>Measuring the forces that humans exert with their fingers could have many potential applications, such as skill transfer from human experts to robots or monitoring humans. In this paper we introduce the \"Exo-Glove\" system, which can measure the joint angles and forces acting on the human finger without covering the skin that is in contact with the manipulated object. In particular, 3-axis sensors measure the deformation of the human skin on the sides of the finger to indirectly measure the 3-axis forces acting on the finger. To provide a frame of reference for the sensors, and to measure the joint angles of the human finger, an exoskeleton with remote center of motion (RCM) joints is used. Experiments showed that with the exoskeleton the quality of the force measurements can be improved.<sep>This paper presents major improvements to a multimodal, adjustable sensitivity skin sensor module. It employs a geomagnetic 3-axis Hall effect sensor to measure changes in the position of a magnetic field generated by an electromagnet. The electromagnet is mounted on a flexible material, and different current values can be supplied to it, enabling adjustments to the sensitivity of the sensor during operation. Capacitive sensing has been added in this iteration of the module, with two sensing modalities: “pre-touch” detection with proximity sensing and normal force capacitive sensing. The sensor has been designed to be interconnected with other sensor modules to be able to cover large surfaces of a robot with normal and shear force sensing and object proximity detection. Furthermore, this paper introduces important size reductions of the previous sensor design, calibration results, and further<sep>Human experts have mastered many manual skills. Transferring those skills to robots or human novices is challenging. Not only the movements, but also the exerted forces are of importance. In this paper we propose a sensor that can measure the force vector acting on the human fingertip, without covering the part of the fingertip that is contact with the touched object. Compared to our previous iterations of this sensor, we use a spring instead of viscoelastic material as the deformable material for the sensor. While it is challenging to include a spring in the given form factor, springs have the benefit of lower hysteresis than viscoelastic materials. This paper presents the integration of the spring in the sensor and shows experimental validation with 8 subjects. Compared to our previous version of the sensor with 2<sep>In this letter, we present a new iteration of a prototype sensor module that can be used as a skin sensor for robots. The sensor uses a hybrid arrangement that consists in a small permanent magnet and an electromagnet working together above a 3-axis magnetic sensor. Both layers are separated by a flexible material that provides compliance to the sensor module. The sensitivity of the sensor can be adjusted by changing the flow of current on the electromagnet, while the permanent magnet increases the intensity of the overall magnetic field to optimize the utilization of the bandwidth of the sensor. Each sensor module includes a microcontroller with digital output that offers multimodal and distributed sensing capabilities. Problem areas of the previous version are indicated, the magnet array idea is presented and tested, and finally experiments<sep>The use of reasonable robot hands could be practical for industries. An Allegro Hand which is inexpensive and easy to maintain but inferior in performance to some highly sophisticated hands (e.g., TWENDY-ONE Hand) was used in our conventional research. To compensate for inferiority performance, we focused on getting abundant tactile information and curved fingertips which is important for in-hand manipulation. Moreover, such tactile information needs to be processed to provide appropriate feedback for the robotic hand control. To achieve this, we proposed using uSkin, 3-axis distributed tactile sensor and using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We prepared the model that was trained with measurements from 3-axis tactile sensors, 6-axis F/T sensors and joint angles. In the experiment, the model executed in-hand manipulation with the ball and the cylinder 10 times. As a result, the successful manipulation<sep>Measuring the forces that humans exert during object manipulation could have several applications, including skill transfer from humans to robots, human monitoring or product optimization. However, measuring the forces from humans without obstructing their interaction with the environment is challenging. In previous research we suggested a tactile sensor that does not cover the human's skin that is in contact with the object. In particular, the sensors are placed on the sides of the human's fingertips, and measure the deformation of the fingerpad resulting from interaction with objects. The current paper proposes a vastly improved design, using four 3-axis sensors to measure the fingerpad deformation. Thereby, the area of the fingertip from which forces can be detected is larger, and a higher signal-to-noise ratio was achieved. Moreover, the mounting on the fingertip was improved, as well<sep>Otaku is a Japanese term commonly associated with fans of Japanese animation, comics or video games. Otaku culture has grown to be a global phenomenon with various hobbies and media. Despite its popularity, research efforts to contribute to the otaku culture have been modest. Therefore, we present Hatsuki, which is a humanoid robot that is especially designed to embody anime characters. Hatsuki advances the state of the art as it: 1) realizes aesthetics resembling anime characters, 2) implements 2D anime-like facial expression system, and 3) realizes anime-style behaviors and interactions. We explain Hatsuki's design specifics and its interaction domains as an autonomous robot and as a teleoperated humanoid avatar. We discuss our efforts under each interaction domain, and follow by discussing its potential deployment venues and applications. We highlight opportunities of interplay between otaku culture<sep>In recent years, the popularity of robotic tactile learning has grown with data-driven approaches being widely utilized for various tasks. It is generally acknowledged that a large and high quality dataset is critical for a data-driven approach. However, collecting such a dataset is challenging and time consuming with a real robot and tactile sensors. Instead, data augmentation techniques are widely used in visual-based learning because it could increase the size/quality of the dataset and improve the learning performance. In this letter, by considering properties of tactile data, we propose geometry transformation tactile data augmentation methods by adopting conventional image data augmentation methods. Our proposal is tested on two different tactile learning tasks, slip prediction and object recognition on a real robot. Two datasets are collected and our datasets are publicly available. The results show that<sep>This paper presents the design and evaluation of the low-cost capacitive proximity-force-fusion sensor \"safe skin\", which can measure simultaneously the proximity of humans as well as the contact force. It was designed such that the force and proximity sensing functions can work concurrently without interfering with each other. Moreover, active shielding, on-chip digitization and ground isolation are implemented for the sensor to minimize the influence from stray capacitance and electromagnetic interference (EMI) from the environment, which ensures that the sensor has a high system robustness for industrial applications. The prototype version has the capability of detecting a grounded human hand sized object from a distance of 400 mm. Moreover, forces in the range of 5 to 40 N can be measured, with 43.7% hysteresis and 6.7% nonlinearity. Due to its sensing characteristics, when used on<sep>The humanoid robot iCub is currently equipped with an array of capacitive sensors that provide pressure information throughout the body of the robot. Even though for some applications this type of data is sufficient, it is not always the case for the fingertips of the robot. In particular, the current sensors do not provide enough information for performing agile manipulation, where both intensity and direction of the exerted force on the fingertips are relevant for the proper execution of the task. In this paper, we present a single 3-axis small magnetic sensor module and we show its effectiveness when integrated into the fingertips of the iCub. The sensor module is derived from uSkin, presented in previous works from our laboratory. Replaceable fingertips were designed, built and integrated via software into the low level communication network<sep>Recently, tactile sensing has attracted great interest for robotic manipulation. Predicting if a grasp will be stable or not, i.e. if the grasped object will drop out of the gripper while being lifted, can aid robust robotic grasping. Previous methods paid equal attention to all regions of the tactile data matrix or all time-steps in the tactile sequence, which may include irrelevant or redundant information. In this paper, we propose to equip Convolutional Neural Networks with spatial-channel and temporal attention mechanisms (SCT attention CNN) to predict future grasp stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to use attention mechanisms for predicting grasp stability only relying on tactile information. We implement our experiments with 52 daily objects. Moreover, we compare different spatio-temporal models and attention mechanisms as an empirical study. We<sep>Predicting the grasp stability before lifting an object, to be detailed, whether a gripped object will move with respect to the gripper, gives more time to modify unstable grasps compared to after-lift slip detection. Recently, deep learning relying on visual and tactile information becomes increasingly popular. However, how to combine visual and tactile data effectively is still under research. In this paper, we propose to fuse visual and tactile data by introducing self attention (SA) mechanisms for predicting grasp stability. In our experiments, we use tactile sensors (uSkin) and camera sensor (Spresense). An image of the object, not collected immediately before or during grasping, is used, as it might be more readily available. Dataset collection is done by grasping and lifting 1050 times on 35 daily objects in total with various forces and grasping positions.<sep>The sensitivity and measuring range of sensors are usually characteristics set before the production stage. However, sensors which are used as part of skin for robots would benefit from the ability to actively adjust their sensitivity during operation. Adjustable sensitivity implicitly broadens the range of operation of the sensor, which in turn is beneficial for interacting with both light and heavy objects. In this letter, we present the second iteration of a prototype sensor module that can be used as a skin sensor for robots. The sensor uses a flat electromagnet above a 3-axis magnetic sensor, separated by a layer of flexible material. The sensitivity of the sensor can be adjusted by changing the current that flows through the flat electromagnet. Each sensor module includes a microcontroller, providing digital output, multimodal and distributed sensing capabilities.<sep>The use of tactile information is one of the most important factors for achieving stable in-grasp manipulation. Especially with low-cost robotic hands that provide low-precision control, robust in-grasp manipulation is challenging. Abundant tactile information could provide the required feed-back to achieve reliable in-grasp manipulation also in such cases. In this research, soft distributed 3-axis skin sensors (\"uSkin\") and 6-axis F/T (force/torque) sensors were mounted on each fingertip of an Allegro Hand to provide rich tactile information. These sensors yielded 78 measurements for each fingertip (72 measurements from the uSkin and 6 measurements from the 6-axis F/T sensor). However, such high-dimensional tactile information can be difficult to process because of the complex contact states between the grasped object and the fingertips. Therefore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to process the tactile information. In this<sep>Skill transfer from humans to robots is challenging. Presently, many researchers focus on capturing only position or joint angle data from humans to teach the robots. Even though this approach has yielded impressive results for grasping applications, reconstructing motion for object handling or fine manipulation from a human hand to a robot hand has been sparsely explored. Humans use tactile feedback to adjust their motion to various objects, but capturing and reproducing the applied forces is an open research question. In this paper we introduce a wearable fingertip tactile sensor, which captures the distributed 3-axis force vectors on the fingertip.

Previous methods focus on proposing novel neural networks (NN) architectures towards one of the above two tasks and did not consider that the two tasks are employed in two interconnected action-phases, i.e. grasping and lifting. Therefore, we firstly explore the possibility of constructing a multi-phase, multi-output framework to combine the stability prediction before lifting and the slip detection after lifting. Moreover, to improve the prediction/detection accuracy, we also proposed to explicitly ensemble different NN architectures using various methods, including attention mechanisms. Our experiments are done with 6 state-of-art NN architectures on two datasets including more than 3000 robotic<sep>Tactile feedback is an important sensory information that contributes to our ability to perform various manipulation tasks. Soft sensor skin aims at providing, e.g., anthropomorphic robot hands with the sense of touch to resemble this ability in teleoperation or prosthetic applications. However, the exploration of an objects texture using a robot hand involves various dynamic contact scenarios. Depending on the relative dynamics between the soft sensor skin and the object, the difficulty and the dimensionality of the recognition task changes dynamically during the manipulation of an object. We deployed a deep gated recurrent unit (GRU)-ensemble with unweighted averaging that allows the texture recognition algorithm to dynamically scale with the number of contact points during active tactile texture exploration while maintaining a high accuracy. We experimentally verify the approach by evaluating the prediction performance of the<sep>The sense of touch is often crucial for humans to perform manipulation tasks. Providing tactile feedback during teleoperation or for users of prosthetic devices would be beneficial. However, the representation of tactile information constitutes a major technical challenge, since the numerous and possibly multimodal sensor readings are massive compared to the available tactile display technology. We introduce an algorithm that deploys two stages of K-means clustering along and across tactile image frames that render tactile sensor information at each time instant. In this manner, the massive tactile information is adaptively compressed in real-time while preserving its physical meaning, thus, remains intuitive and direct. We experimentally verify and examine the characteristics of our algorithm by evaluating the original and compressed tactile data. The data was gathered during the active tactile exploration of several objects of daily<sep>Performing various in-hand manipulation tasks, without learning each individual task, would enable robots to act more versatile, while reducing the effort for training. However, in general it is difficult to achieve stable in-hand manipulation, because the contact state between the fingertips becomes difficult to model, especially for a robot hand with anthropomorphically shaped fingertips. Rich tactile feedback can aid the robust task execution, but on the other hand it is challenging to process high-dimensional tactile information. In the current paper we use two fingers of the Allegro hand, and each fingertip is anthropomorphically shaped and equipped not only with 6-axis force-torque (F/T) sensors, but also with uSkin tactile sensors, which provide 24 tri-axial measurements per fingertip. A convolutional neural network is used to process the high dimensional uSkin information, and a long short-term memory (LSTM)<sep>Japanese character figurines are popular and have pivot position in Otaku culture. Although numerous robots have been developed, less have focused on otaku-culture or on embodying the anime character figurine. Therefore, we take the first steps to bridge this gap by developing Hatsuki, which is a humanoid robot platform with anime based design. Hatsuki's novelty lies in aesthetic design, 2D facial expressions, and anime-style behaviors that allows it to deliver rich interaction experiences resembling anime-characters. We explain our design implementation process of Hatsuki, followed by our evaluations. In order to explore user impressions and opinions towards Hatsuki, we conducted a questionnaire in the world's largest anime-figurine event. The results indicate that participants were generally very satisfied with Hatsuki's design, and proposed various use case scenarios and deployment contexts for Hatsuki.

Currently, researchers typically use mapping of human hand postures onto the robot hand with the help of a data glove. This approach to skill transfer has yielded impressive results for grasping applications, but is difficult to implement for fine manipulation tasks. Humans use their sense of touch to handle various objects to perform fine manipulation tasks such as stitching, calligraphy, carving, and painting. Consequently, it is also important to measure the tactile data exerted by the human hand on the object while performing fine manipulation tasks. Previously we presented FingerTac - a wearable tactile sensor that can be worn interchangeably on human hands as well as on robot hands. FingerTac is capable of measuring 3-axis tactile data distributed at 20 sensing points</abstract>", "<keyword>Bicuspid aortic valve<sep>Atrial fibrillation<sep>Etiology<sep>Pulmonary vein<sep>Heart failure<sep>Aortic valve replacement<sep>Stroke (engine)<sep>Ejection fraction<sep>Mitral valve replacement<sep>Radiofrequency ablation<sep>Asymptomatic<sep>Aorta<sep>Perioperative<sep>Mitral regurgitation<sep>Clinical endpoint<sep>Valve replacement<sep>Aortic valve stenosis<sep>Concomitant<sep>Hemodynamics<sep>Aortic root<sep>Stenosis<sep>Randomized controlled trial<sep>Mitral valve<sep>Atrial Appendage<sep>Bicuspid valve<sep>Aortic valve</keyword><title>Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Replacement with a Self-Expanding Valve in Low-Risk Patients<sep>CRT-600.04 Clinical and Quality-of-Life Outcomes in Patients With Symptomatic or Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis: An Analysis From the Evolut Low-Risk Trial<sep>Freestyle Aortic Bioprostheses in Patients 60 Years old and Younger<sep>Long-term outcomes of etiology specific annuloplasty ring repair of ischemic mitral regurgitation<sep>Impact of aortic valve replacement in symptomatic low-risk patients with less than severe aortic stenosis<sep>Randomized feasibility trial of prophylactic radiofrequency ablation to prevent atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery<sep>Propensity-Matched 1-Year Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Bicuspid and Tricuspid Patients<sep>30-Day Outcomes Following Transfemoral Transseptal Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement<sep>2-Year Outcomes After Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients<sep>Outcomes in Patients With Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis (from the Evolut Low Risk Trial)<sep>Structural Valve Deterioration After Self-Expanding Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients at Intermediate or High Risk<sep>Self-expanding Transcatheter vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Intermediate-Risk Patients</title><abstract>Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at increased risk for death from surgery; less is known about TAVR in low-risk patients.<sep>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has demonstrated comparable outcomes to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, including patients at low risk for surgery.

All patients, 60 years old and younger, between January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2015 who underwent implantation of a Freestyle aortic valve at a single institution were reviewed. Medical records and telephone interviews were utilized for data collection. 515 patients were identified with an average age of 51.3 years. Mean follow up was 11.1 years. 225 full root replacements and 290 subcoronary implants were performed. Overall survival, including patients with concomitant procedures, at 15 years was 63.7% (95% CI 58.3-68.5). Isolated subcoronary implants (58%,167/290) had a 15-year survival of 71.6% (95% CI 62.6-78.7) vs 78.4% (95% CI 69.7, 84.9) for isolated root replacements (63%,141/225) which was not statistically significant (P = 0.397). No significant difference in operative SVD at 15 years occurred between full root replacements 37.6% (95% CI 27.2-50.2) vs subcoronary implants 39.4% (95% CI31.1, 49.0). 110 patients required reoperation solely for intrinsic SVD. 93% (102/110) failed due to aortic insufficiency. Of reoperative interventions for SVD, 37% (41/110) of patients required urgent reoperation and 4.5% (5/110) required emergent reoperation. Pseudoaneurysms developed in six of the full root replacements. Freestyle aortic valves have a high rate of acute failure requiring urgent or emergent reintervention in patients 60 years old and younger. This has led our group to shift practice away from their implantation.<sep>Reductive annuloplasty repair of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is associated with high rates of recurrent MR, which may be improved with etiology-specific annuloplasty rings.From October 2005 to May 2015, 128 consecutive patients underwent repair of IMR with the GeoForm ring. Clinical data was extracted from our local Society of Thoracic Surgeons database and electronic medical records. Mortality data was obtained from the Michigan State Social Security Death Index.The average age of patients was 65±11 years with mean pre-op left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%±10% and MR grade of 3.1±0.9 (0-4+). Thirty-day mortality was 4.7%, rate of renal failure 7.9%, rate of atrial fibrillation 27.3%, and no strokes were observed. Of the surviving patients, 89% (109/122) had a follow-up echocardiogram beyond 1 month with a mean echocardiographic follow-up of 59±39 months. LVEF improved from 30%±10% to 38%±14%, P<0.001) while end-diastolic (5.9±0.0 to 5.3±0.9 cm, P<0.001) and end-systolic (5.0±1.0 to 4.4±1.1 cm, P<0.001) left ventricular (LV) diameters decreased, as compared to pre-operative values. Seven patients were found to have recurrent moderate or greater IMR in follow-up to 10 years with three being due to ring dehiscence. One-, 5-, and 10-year freedom from recurrent moderate or severe IMR was 98%, 94%, and 80% respectively. One-, 5-, and 10-year survival was 91%, 77%, and 44%, respectively.Overall, etiology-specific ring repair of IMR was associated with low rates of recurrent MR on long-term follow-up, coupled with significant LV reverse remodeling and improvement in ejection fraction.<sep>Objective To evaluate whether transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (TAVR or SAVR) affects clinical and haemodynamic outcomes in symptomatic patients with moderately-severe aortic stenosis (AS). Methods Echocardiographic evidence of severe AS for enrolment in the Evolut Low Risk trial was based on site-reported measurements. For this post hoc analysis, core laboratory measurements identified patients with symptomatic moderately-severe AS (1.0&lt;aortic valve area (AVA)&lt;1.5 cm 2 , 3.0&lt;peak velocity&lt;4.0 m/s and 20≤mean gradient (MG) &lt;40 mm Hg). Clinical outcomes were reported through 2 years. Results Moderately-severe AS was identified in 113 out of 1414 patients (8%). Baseline AVA was 1.1±0.1 cm 2 , peak velocity 3.7±0.2 m/s, MG 32.7±4.8 mm Hg and aortic valve calcium volume 588 (364, 815) mm 3 . Valve haemodynamics improved following TAVR (AVA 2.5±0.7 cm 2 , peak velocity 1.9±0.5 m/s and MG 8.4±4.8 mm Hg; p&lt;0.001 for all) and SAVR (AVA 2.0±0.6 cm 2 , peak velocity 2.1±0.4 m/s and MG 10.0±3.4 mm Hg; p&lt;0.001 for all). At 24 months, the rates of death or disabling stroke were similar (TAVR 7.7% vs SAVR 6.5%; p=0.82). Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score assessing quality of life improved from baseline to 30 days after TAVR (67.0±20.6 to 89.3±13.4; p&lt;0.001) and SAVR (67.5±19.6 to 78.3±22.3; p=0.001). Conclusions In symptomatic patients with moderately-severe AS, AVR appears to be beneficial. Determination of the clinical and haemodynamic profile of patients who can benefit from earlier isolated AVR needs further investigation in randomised clinical trials.<sep>Evaluate the feasibility of prophylactic radiofrequency isolation of the pulmonary veins, with left atrial appendage amputation, to reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery in patients aged 70 and older.The Federal Food and Drug Administration granted an investigational device exemption to utilize a bipolar radiofrequency clamp for prophylactic pulmonary vein isolation in a limited, feasibility trial. Sixty-two patients without prior dysrhythmias, were prospectively randomized to undergo either their index cardiac surgical procedure, or bilateral pulmonary vein isolation and left atrial appendage amputation during their cardiac operation. The primary outcome was occurrence of in-hospital POAF. Subjects were on 24-hour telemetry until discharge. Dysrhythmias, any episode of atrial fibrillation > 30 seconds, were confirmed by electrophysiologists blinded to the study.Sixty patients, mean age 75 years and mean CHA2DS2-VASc score 4, were analyzed. Thirty-one patients randomized to control and twenty-nine to the treatment group. Majority of cases in each group were isolated CABG. No perioperative complications related to the treatment procedure, need for permanent pacemaker, or mortality occurred. The in-hospital incidence of POAF was 55% (17/31) in the control group and 7% (2/29) in the treatment group. (p<0.001) The control group had a significantly higher requirement for antiarrhythmic medications at discharge, 45% (14/31) vs 7% (2/29) in the treatment group (p<0.001).Prophylactic radiofrequency isolation of the pulmonary veins with left atrial appendage amputation, during the primary cardiac surgical operation, reduced the incidence of POAF in patients 70 years and older with no history of atrial arrhythmias.<sep>The aim of this study was to compare 1-year outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in low surgical risk patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis to patients with tricuspid aortic stenosis.The pivotal TAVR trials excluded patients with bicuspid aortic valves. The Low Risk Bicuspid Study 30-day primary endpoint of death or disabling stroke was 1.3%.The Low Risk Bicuspid Study is a prospective, single-arm, TAVR trial that enrolled patients from 25 U.S. sites. A screening committee confirmed bicuspid anatomy and valve classification on computed tomography using the Sievers classification. Valve sizing was by annular measurements. An independent clinical events committee adjudicated all serious adverse events, and an independent core laboratory assessed all echocardiograms. The 150 patients from the Low Risk Bicuspid Study were propensity matched to the TAVR patients in the randomized Evolut Low Risk Trial using the 1:1 5- to-1-digit greedy method, resulting in 145 pairs.All-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 1 year was 1.4% in the bicuspid and 2.8% in the tricuspid group (P = 0.413). A pacemaker was implanted in 16.6% of bicuspid and 17.9% of tricuspid patients (P = 0.741). The effective orifice area was similar between groups at 1 year (2.2 ± 0.7 cm2 vs 2.3 ± 0.6 cm2, P = 0.677) as was the mean gradient (8.7 ± 3.9 mm Hg vs 8.5 ± 3.1 mm Hg, P = 0.754). Fewer patients in the bicuspid group had mild or worse paravalvular leak (21.3% vs 42.6%, P < 0.001).There were no significant differences in clinical or forward flow hemodynamic outcomes between the propensity-matched groups at 1 year.<sep>The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) with transfemoral access in patients at prohibitive or high surgical risk.Prohibitive surgical risk may preclude mitral valve replacement surgery in some patients. The investigational Intrepid TMVR system has previously been evaluated using transapical access for delivery of a self-expanding bioprosthetic valve.This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized early feasibility study evaluated the safety and performance of the Intrepid valve using transfemoral access enabling transseptal delivery in patients with moderate to severe or severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation at high surgical risk. Candidacy was determined by heart teams, with approval by a central screening committee. Echocardiographic data were evaluated by an independent core laboratory. Clinical events were adjudicated by a clinical events committee.Fifteen patients were enrolled at 6 sites from February 2020 to May 2021. The median age was 80 years, and median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality was 4.7%; 87% of patients were men, and 53% had undergone prior sternotomy. Fourteen implants were successful. One patient was converted to surgery during the index procedure. Patients stayed a median of 5 days postprocedure. There were 6 access site bleeds (40%) and 11 iatrogenic atrial septal defect closures (73%). At 30 days, there were no deaths, strokes, or reinterventions. All patients undergoing implantation had trace or no valvular or paravalvular mitral regurgitation, and the mean gradient was 4.7 mm Hg (IQR: 3.0-6.7 mm Hg).Thirty-day results from the Intrepid transfemoral TMVR early feasibility study demonstrate excellent valve function and no mortality or stroke. Additional patients and longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. ([The Early Feasibility Study of the Intrepid™ TMVR Transseptal System]; NCT02322840).<sep>The Evolut Low Risk Trial (Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients) showed that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a supra-annular, self-expanding valve was noninferior to surgery for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years. This finding was based on a Bayesian analysis performed after 850 patients had reached 1 year of follow-up.The goal of this study was to report the full 2-year clinical and echocardiographic outcomes for patients enrolled in the Evolut Low Risk Trial.A total of 1,414 low-surgical risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were randomized to receive TAVR or surgical AVR. An independent clinical events committee adjudicated adverse events, and a central echocardiographic core laboratory assessed hemodynamic endpoints.An attempted implant was performed in 730 TAVR and 684 surgical patients from March 2016 to May 2019. The Kaplan-Meier rates for the complete 2-year primary endpoint of death or disabling stroke were 4.3% in the TAVR group and 6.3% in the surgery group (P = 0.084). These rates were comparable to the interim Bayesian rates of 5.3% with TAVR and 6.7% with surgery (difference: -1.4%; 95% Bayesian credible interval: -4.9% to 2.1%). All-cause mortality rates were 3.5% vs 4.4% (P = 0.366), and disabling stroke rates were 1.5% vs 2.7% (P = 0.119), respectively. Between years 1 and 2, there was no convergence of the primary outcome curves.The complete 2-year follow-up from the Evolut Low Risk Trial found that TAVR is noninferior to surgery for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke, with event rates that were slightly better than those predicted by using the Bayesian analysis. (Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients [Evolut Low Risk Trial]; NCT02701283).<sep>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has comparable outcomes with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, including those at low risk for surgery. Less is known about TAVI outcomes in asymptomatic patients. This analysis compares clinical, hemodynamic, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes after TAVI or SAVR for low-risk asymptomatic patients. The randomized Evolut Low Risk trial enrolled asymptomatic patients treated with TAVI (n = 76) and SAVR (n = 62). New York Heart Association functional class I identified patients without symptoms. Clinical outcomes, echocardiographic findings, and QOL in both groups were compared 30 days and 12 months after AVR. Asymptomatic patients had a mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 1.7 ± 0.6, 73% were men, and mean age was 74.2 ± 5.8 years. The composite end point of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke was similar at 12 months in patients with TAVI (1.3%) and SAVR (6.5%; p = 0.11), although patients with SAVR tended to have higher rates of all-cause mortality (4.8%) compared with patients with TAVI (0.0%, p = 0.05). Patients with TAVI had lower mean aortic valve gradients (8.1 ± 3.2 mm Hg) and larger mean effective orifice area (2.3 ± 0.6 mm Hg) than patients with SAVR (10.8 ± 3.8; p <0.001 and 1.9 ± 0.6; p = 0.001, respectively), and showed significant improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores from baseline to 30 days (∆12.1 ± 23.6; p <0.001), whereas patients with SAVR did not (∆2.2 ± 20.3; p = 0.398). Patients with TAVI and SAVR had a significant improvement in QOL by 12 months compared with baseline. In conclusion, low risk asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI had comparable clinical outcomes to SAVR, with superior valve performance and faster QOL improvement.<sep>The frequency and clinical importance of structural valve deterioration (SVD) in patients undergoing self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgery is poorly understood.To evaluate the 5-year incidence, clinical outcomes, and predictors of hemodynamic SVD in patients undergoing self-expanding TAVI or surgery.This post hoc analysis pooled data from the CoreValve US High Risk Pivotal (n = 615) and SURTAVI (n = 1484) randomized clinical trials (RCTs); it was supplemented by the CoreValve Extreme Risk Pivotal trial (n = 485) and CoreValve Continued Access Study (n = 2178). Patients with severe aortic valve stenosis deemed to be at intermediate or increased risk of 30-day surgical mortality were included. Data were collected from December 2010 to June 2016, and data were analyzed from December 2021 to October 2022.Patients were randomized to self-expanding TAVI or surgery in the RCTs or underwent self-expanding TAVI for clinical indications in the nonrandomized studies.The primary end point was the incidence of SVD through 5 years (from the RCTs). Factors associated with SVD and its association with clinical outcomes were evaluated for the pooled RCT and non-RCT population. SVD was defined as (1) an increase in mean gradient of 10 mm Hg or greater from discharge or at 30 days to last echocardiography with a final mean gradient of 20 mm Hg or greater or (2) new-onset moderate or severe intraprosthetic aortic regurgitation or an increase of 1 grade or more.Of 4762 included patients, 2605 (54.7%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 82.1 (7.4) years. A total of 2099 RCT patients, including 1128 who received TAVI and 971 who received surgery, and 2663 non-RCT patients who received TAVI were included. The cumulative incidence of SVD treating death as a competing risk was lower in patients undergoing TAVI than surgery (TAVI, 2.20%; surgery, 4.38%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.78; P = .004). This lower risk was most pronounced in patients with smaller annuli (23 mm diameter or smaller; TAVI, 1.32%; surgery, 5.84%; HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.73; P = .02). SVD was associated with increased 5-year all-cause mortality (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.46-2.82; P < .001), cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.20-2.90; P = .006), and valve disease or worsening heart failure hospitalizations (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.23-3.84; P = .008). Predictors of SVD were developed from multivariate analysis.This study found a lower rate of SVD in patients undergoing self-expanding TAVI vs surgery at 5 years. Doppler echocardiography was a valuable tool to detect SVD, which was associated with worse clinical outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01240902, NCT01586910, and NCT01531374.<sep>In patients with severe aortic valve stenosis at intermediate surgical risk, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a self-expanding supra-annular valve was noninferior to surgery for all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years. Comparisons of longer-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes in these patients are limited.To report prespecified secondary 5-year outcomes from the Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis in Intermediate Risk Subjects Who Need Aortic Valve Replacement (SURTAVI) randomized clinical trial.SURTAVI is a prospective randomized, unblinded clinical trial. Randomization was stratified by investigational site and need for revascularization determined by the local heart teams. Patients with severe aortic valve stenosis deemed to be at intermediate risk of 30-day surgical mortality were enrolled at 87 centers from June 19, 2012, to June 30, 2016, in Europe and North America. Analysis took place between August and October 2021.Patients were randomized to TAVR with a self-expanding, supra-annular transcatheter or a surgical bioprosthesis.The prespecified secondary end points of death or disabling stroke and other adverse events and hemodynamic findings at 5 years. An independent clinical event committee adjudicated all serious adverse events and an independent echocardiographic core laboratory evaluated all echocardiograms at 5 years.A total of 1660 individuals underwent an attempted TAVR (n = 864) or surgical (n = 796) procedure. The mean (SD) age was 79.8 (6.2) years, 724 (43.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) Society of Thoracic Surgery Predicted Risk of Mortality score was 4.5% (1.6%). At 5 years, the rates of death or disabling stroke were similar (TAVR, 31.3% vs surgery, 30.8%; hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.85-1.22]; P = .85). Transprosthetic gradients remained lower (mean [SD], 8.6 [5.5] mm Hg vs 11.2 [6.0] mm Hg; P < .001) and aortic valve areas were higher (mean [SD], 2.2 [0.7] cm2 vs 1.8 [0.6] cm2; P < .001) with TAVR vs surgery. More patients had moderate/severe paravalvular leak with TAVR than surgery (11 [3.0%] vs 2 [0.7%]; risk difference, 2.37% [95% CI, 0.17%- 4.85%]; P = .05). New pacemaker implantation rates were higher for TAVR than surgery at 5 years (289 [39.1%] vs 94 [15.1%]; hazard ratio, 3.30 [95% CI, 2.61-4.17]; log-rank P < .001), as were valve reintervention rates (27 [3.5%] vs 11 [1.9%]; hazard ratio, 2.21 [95% CI, 1.10-4.45]; log-rank P = .02), although between 2 and 5 years only 6 patients who underwent TAVR and 7 who underwent surgery required a reintervention.Among intermediate-risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, major clinical outcomes at 5 years were similar for TAVR and surgery. TAVR was associated with superior hemodynamic valve performance but also with more paravalvular leak and valve reinterventions.</abstract>", "<keyword>Flow control (data)<sep>Airfoil<sep>Wing<sep>Thrust vectoring<sep>Plenum space<sep>Thrust<sep>Deflection (physics)<sep>Fluidics<sep>Overall pressure ratio<sep>Chord (peer-to-peer)<sep>Conformal map<sep>Flow (mathematics)<sep>Rudder<sep>Flight control surfaces<sep>Aerodynamics<sep>Nozzle<sep>Lift-induced drag<sep>Actuator<sep>Trailing edge<sep>Jet (fluid)<sep>Pitching moment<sep>Drag<sep>Pressure drop<sep>Angle of attack<sep>Control theory (sociology)</keyword><title>Coordinated Roll Control of Conformal Finless Flying Wing Aircraft<sep>A Control Allocation Method to Reduce Roll-Yaw coupling on Tailless Aircraft<sep>Three-axis control of tailless aircraft using fluidic actuators: MAGMA case study<sep>Yaw control of maneuvering tailless aircraft using induced drag – a control allocation method based on aerodynamic mode shapes<sep>DARPA CRANE – A toolset for the design of compact fluidic distribution systems for flow control applications: Part 1 – Model development and system optimisation<sep>DARPA CRANE – A toolset for the design of compact fluidic distribution systems for flow control applications: Part 2 – Model validation and implementation<sep>A Novel Control Allocation Method for Yaw Control of Tailless Aircraft<sep>Experimental investigation of the effectiveness of Coanda reaction surface geometries for Super-Critical Circulation-Control</title><abstract>Attitude control of tailless aircraft is typically achieved through a system of trailing-edge flaps that produce coupled control effects in pitch, roll and yaw due to changes in lift and drag distributions. This paper presents a novel control allocation method which allows conformal trailing-edge controls to generate yawing moments with no coupling, thereby simplifying the required control suite. The method is demonstrated through modelling of a coordinated roll manoeuvre of a tailless aircraft in which yaw control is provided by trailing-edge flaps only. For a typical tailless aircraft configuration, it is shown that a coordinated rolling manoeuvre can be achieved with a reduction of at least 30% of the required control deflection compared to solutions using non-conformal controls such as split drag rudders.<sep>This paper proposes a novel method to achieve three-axis control of a tailless aircraft using conventional trailing edge controls only during a rolling maneuver. The method is based on the synthesis of control allocation modes which produce laterally asymmetric drag at constant lift, pitching moment and rolling moment. Required control moments throughout a rolling maneuver are calculated using a dynamic inversion approach and control allocation performed by calculating the required combination of control modes. Results are presented for the MAGMA aircraft for roll rates which achieve a bank angle of 45 degrees in between 1.2s and 8s. Obtained solutions have equivalent or improved authority to conventional mid-chord spoilers for lift coefficients up to 0.3, representing a large part of the operational envelope of the aircraft.<sep>This paper presents an assessment of the opportunity for full three-axis control of the MAGMA aircraft with the fins removed using a combination of Fluidic Thrust Vectoring, Circulation Control and Wingtip Reaction Jets. Effectiveness of the fluidic actuators is defined by values derived from previous flight test campaigns. Simulations are undertaken to assess the mass flow required to fly a typical mission for the aircraft. Results show that by using the circulation control devices for roll and pitch control, and the fluidic thrust vectoring for yaw full control can be achieved using a mean value of 60% of the available mass flow from the engine. This result indicates that it would be possible to demonstrate full three-axis control of a sub-scale demonstrator aircraft within the limits of current manufacturing technology.<sep>This paper proposes a novel method to achieve three-axis control of a tailless aircraft using conventional conformal trailing edge controls only. The method is based on the synthesis of control allocation modes which produce laterally asymmetric profile drag and induced drag at constant lift, pitching moment and rolling moment. Results are presented for a generic low aspect ratio swept wing planform at a range of trimmed sideslip angles up to 10 degrees, with control allocations optimized for either minimum drag or minimum aggregate control deflection. Obtained solutions have equivalent authority to conventional mid-chord spoilers with reduced overall drag and, at angles of trimmed sideslip less than 4 degrees, reduced aggregate control deflection. This presents designers with an option for directional control which reduces the need for non-conformal controls outside of the low speed flight regime.<sep>This paper describes an engineering toolset developed to enable early-stage design of compact fluidic distribution systems for flow control applications. The distribution system is conceived from conventional internal flow system components such as diffusers, pipes, and turns. The design objective is to transfer the flow from an inlet pipe to a high aspect ratio outlet slot via efficiently distributing the flow, turning its direction, and reducing its velocity before entering the plenum ending with the exit slot. In doing so, the total pressure drop within the system is minimised. Analytical and semi-empirical models of components have been used whenever available. For more complex components where such models do not exist, reduced-order models based on numerical simulations were produced. The developed toolset was used to identify optimum system layouts while adhering to compactness constraints. We considered an example wing trailing-edge use case with a slot of length 1m and thickness 0.5mm, and overall system chordwise depth limit of 16cm. It was shown that for such distribution system, a total pressure drop of just above 3.5% can be achieved. Moreover, if the system compactness is increased by reducing chordwise extent by 30%, the total pressure drop only increases to 4.2%.<sep>This paper describes the second part of the development process of an engineering toolset to enable early-stage design of compact fluid distribution systems for flow control applications. The distribution system is conceived from conventional internal flow system components such as diffusers, pipes, and turns with a design objective to duct high-pressure air from concentrated sources to highly spatially distributed geometries in an effective, efficient, and compact manner. In this part, an experimental rig of a typical flow distribution system is realised and pressure measurements across various locations of the system are collected and compared to results from the developed numerical tool. It was found that the average absolute difference of the pressure values is within 3.5%, validating the developed tool and providing confidence in its predictive performance. Two main insights are found: First, skin friction losses in pipes represent a primary contributor to the overall pressure drop; and second, flow turning can also lead to large losses, but this can be mitigated by slowing the flow as much as possible before turning. Finally, a simple load balancing tool is presented that tailors the area of each path within the system to ensure equal mass flow rates exist along the different paths. This improves the uniformity of the flow exiting the plenum, and is found to marginally reduce total pressure drop<sep>Tailless aircraft without vertical stabilisers typically use drag effectors in the form of spoilers or split flaps to generate control moments in yaw. This paper introduces a novel control allocation method by which full three-axis control authority can be achieved by the use of conventional lift effectors only, which reduces system complexity and control deflection required to achieve a given yawing moment. The proposed method is based on synthesis of control allocation modes that generate asymmetric profile and lift induced drag whilst maintaining the lift, pitching moment and rolling moment at the trim state. The method uses low order models for aerodynamic behaviour characterisation based on thin aerofoil theory, lifting surface methodology and ESDU datasheets and is applied to trapezoidal wings of varying sweep and taper. Control allocation modes are derived using the zero-sets of surrogate models for the characterised aerodynamic behaviours. Results are presented in the form of control allocations for a range of trimmed sideslip angles up to 10 degrees optimised for either maximum aerodynamic efficiency (minimum drag for a specific yawing moment) or minimum aggregate control deflection (as a surrogate observability metric). Outcomes for the two optimisation objectives are correlated in that minimum deflection solutions are always consistent with efficient ones. A configuration with conventional drag effector is used as a reference baseline. It is shown that, through appropriate allocation of lift based control effectors, a given yawing moment can be produced with up to a factor of eight less aggregate control deflection and up to 30% less overall drag compared to use of a conventional drag effector.<sep>The maximum effectiveness of fluidic Super Critical Circulation Control (SCCC) actuators is limited by separation of the actuating jet at high pressure ratios. An important design goal for SCCC is to maximize actuator effectiveness relative to geometric implementation cost, for which trailing edge radius can be taken as a proxy. For experimental work, actuator effectiveness can be meaningfully assessed under quiescent conditions when the jet total pressure is significantly higher than the intended operational freestream total pressure. A jet with a nozzle pressure ratio of up to 15 was issued from a convergent-only rectangular nozzle with an aspect ratio of 22.5 between two walls to produce a two-dimensional flow into quiescent air. Circular and elliptical reaction surface geometries were tested, with ratios of the nozzle height h to the radius or semi-minor axis of the geometries respectively of 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1, and ellipse eccentricity 1.5 or 2. Geometries were offset to create a base step of height h_s between the nozzle lip and the surface of h_s/h = 0 to 2. Schlieren photography and analysis of static pressures measured on the reaction surfaces was used to investigate the effectiveness of the different geometries with different base step heights. For circular geometries, detachment nozzle pressure ratio agrees with the literature. A scaling of elliptic geometries based on the semi-major axis was shown to provide a collapse onto the commonly used h/R scaling for circular geometries. Jet separation location generally moves towards the slot with increasing NPR however is not monotonic due to shock interactions and changing shock cell length. This behaviour warrants further investigation in co-flow experiments.</abstract>", "<keyword>Antiseptic<sep>Antibiotics<sep>Antibiotic resistance<sep>Disease<sep>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease<sep>Diabetes mellitus<sep>Predation<sep>Systemic inflammation<sep>Sickle cell anemia<sep>Abdominal surgery<sep>Unfolded protein response<sep>Cereus<sep>Irritable bowel syndrome<sep>Gut microbiome<sep>Aggression<sep>Receptor<sep>Graft-versus-host disease<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation<sep>Psychological intervention<sep>Enterococcus faecalis<sep>Bacillus cereus<sep>Microbiome<sep>Chlorhexidine<sep>Metagenomics<sep>Lachnospiraceae<sep>Inflammation<sep>Immune system<sep>Hepatology<sep>Adverse effect<sep>Weight gain<sep>Psychological distress<sep>Cell<sep>Agonistic behaviour<sep>Significant difference<sep>Hepatocyte<sep>Transplantation<sep>Chronic pain<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Distress<sep>Type 2 diabetes<sep>Butyrate<sep>Liver disease<sep>Population<sep>Dysbiosis<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation<sep>Oral Microbiome<sep>Firmicutes<sep>Innate lymphoid cell<sep>Bacteria<sep>Gastrectomy<sep>Stem cell<sep>Body weight<sep>Cephalosporin<sep>Posttraumatic stress<sep>Myxococcus xanthus<sep>Oral microbiology<sep>Immunity<sep>Gut flora<sep>Kidney stones<sep>Probiotic<sep>Gene signature<sep>Cohort<sep>Tuft</keyword><title>CroR Regulates Expression of <i>pbp4(5)</i> to Promote Cephalosporin Resistance in Enterococcus faecalis<sep>275.

Risk prediction relies heavily on subjective acute distress (e.g., Injured Trauma Survivor Screen; ITSS). Conversely, biomarkers, like the intestinal microbiome, provide objective ways to understand biological mechanisms underlying risk and inform interventions. We investigated how PTSD risk status, as measured by ITSS, relates to intestinal microbial diversity after injury.<sep>Pain is a debilitating symptom and leading reason for hospitalization of individuals with sickle cell disease. Chronic sickle cell pain is poorly managed because the biological basis is not fully understood. Using transgenic sickle cell mice and fecal material transplant, we determined that the gut microbiome drives persistent sickle cell pain. In parallel patient and mouse analyses, we identified bilirubin as one metabolite that induces sickle cell pain by altering vagus nerve activity. Furthermore, we determined that decreased abundance of the gut bacteria Akkermansia mucinophila is a critical driver of chronic sickle cell pain. These experiments demonstrate that the sickle cell gut microbiome drives chronic widespread pain and identify bacterial species and metabolites that should be targeted for chronic sickle cell disease pain management.<sep>Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are crucial for the maintenance of host–microbiota homeostasis in gastrointestinal mucosal tissues. The mechanisms that maintain lineage identity of intestinal ILC3s and ILC3-mediated orchestration of microbiota and mucosal T cell immunity are elusive. Here, we identified BATF as a gatekeeper of ILC3 homeostasis in the gut. Depletion of BATF in ILC3s resulted in excessive interferon-γ production, dysbiosis, aberrant T cell immune responses, and spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which was considerably ameliorated by the removal of adaptive immunity, interferon-γ blockade, or antibiotic treatment. Mechanistically, BATF directly binds to the cis-regulatory elements of type 1 effector genes, restrains their chromatin accessibility, and inhibits their expression. Conversely, BATF promotes chromatin accessibility of genes involved in MHCII antigen processing and presentation pathways, which in turn directly promotes the transition of precursor ILC3s to MHCII+ ILC3s. Collectively, our findings reveal that BATF is a key transcription factor for maintaining ILC3 stability and coordinating ILC3-mediated control of intestinal homeostasis.<sep>Succinate produced by the commensal protist Tritrichomonas musculis (T. mu) stimulates chemosensory tuft cells, resulting in intestinal type 2 immunity. Tuft cells express the succinate receptor SUCNR1, yet this receptor does not mediate antihelminth immunity nor alter protist colonization. Here, we report that microbial-derived succinate increases Paneth cell numbers and profoundly alters the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) landscape in the small intestine. Succinate was sufficient to drive this epithelial remodeling, but not in mice lacking tuft cell chemosensory components required to detect this metabolite. Tuft cells respond to succinate by stimulating type 2 immunity, leading to interleukin-13-mediated epithelial and AMP expression changes. Moreover, type 2 immunity decreases the total number of mucosa-associated bacteria and alters the small intestinal microbiota composition. Finally, tuft cells can detect short-term bacterial dysbiosis that leads to a spike in luminal succinate levels and modulate AMP production in response. These findings demonstrate that a single metabolite produced by commensals can markedly shift the intestinal AMP profile and suggest that tuft cells utilize SUCNR1 and succinate sensing to modulate bacterial homeostasis.<sep>The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has increased, coinciding with lifestyle changes that have likely altered the gut microbiota. Dysbiosis, gut barrier dysfunction, and elevated systemic inflammation consistent with microbial antigen exposure, have been associated with T1D susceptibility and progression. A 6-week, single-arm, open-label pilot trial was conducted to investigate whether daily multi-strain probiotic supplementation could reduce this familial inflammation in 25 unaffected siblings of T1D patients. Probiotic supplementation was well-tolerated as reflected by high participant adherence and no adverse events. Community alpha and beta diversity were not altered between the pre- and post-supplement stool samplings. However, LEfSe analyses identified post-supplement enrichment of the family Lachnospiraceae, producers of the anti-inflammatory short chain fatty acid butyrate. Systemic inflammation was measured by plasma-induced transcription and quantified with a gene ontology-based composite inflammatory index (I.I.com). Post-supplement I.I.com was significantly reduced and pathway analysis predicted inhibition of numerous inflammatory mediators and activation of IL10RA. Subjects with the greatest post-supplement reduction in I.I.com exhibited significantly lower CD4+ CD45RO+ (memory):CD4+ CD45RA+ (naïve) T-cell ratios after supplementation. Post-supplement IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, CCL2, and CCL24 plasma levels were significantly reduced, while post-supplement butyrate levels trended 1.4-fold higher. Probiotic supplementation may modify T1D susceptibility and progression and warrants further study.<sep>The increasing incidence of Type 1 diabetes has coincided with the emergence of the low-fiber, high-gluten Western diet and other environmental factors linked to dysbiosis. Since Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299 v (Lp299v) supplementation improves gut barrier function and reduces systemic inflammation, we studied its effects in spontaneously diabetic DRlyp/lyp rats provided a normal cereal diet (ND) or a gluten-free hydrolyzed casein diet (HCD). All rats provided ND developed diabetes (62.5±7.7 days); combining ND with Lp299v did not improve survival. Diabetes was delayed by HCD (72.2±9.4 days, p = .01) and further delayed by HCD+Lp299v (84.9±14.3 days, p < .001). HCD+Lp299v pups exhibited increased plasma propionate and butyrate levels, which correlated with enriched fecal Bifidobacteriaceae and Clostridiales taxa. Islet transcriptomic and histologic analyses at 40-days of age revealed that rats fed HCD expressed an autophagy profile, while those provided HCD+Lp299v expressed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) and antioxidative defense pathways, including Nrf2. Exposing insulinoma cells to propionate and butyrate promoted the antioxidative defense response but did not recapitulate the HCD+Lp299v islet ERAD transcriptomic profile. Here, both diet and microbiota influenced diabetes susceptibility. Moreover, Lp299v supplement modulated antioxidative defense and ER stress responses in β-cells, potentially offering a new therapeutic direction to thwart diabetes progression and preserve insulin secretion.<sep>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). An impaired intestinal epithelial barrier is an important component of GVHD pathogenesis. However, contributing host factors that modulate mucosal barrier integrity during GVHD are poorly defined. We hypothesized that vitamin A and retinoic acid (RA) exert positive impacts on maintaining intestinal barrier function after HSCT, thus preventing or dampening GVHD severity. Unexpectedly, we found that exogenous RA increased intestinal permeability of recipient mice after allogeneic HSCT. Serum bacterial endotoxin levels were significantly higher in GVHD mice fed a vitamin A-high (VAH) diet compared to those fed a vitamin A-normal (VAN) diet, indicating a more compromised intestinal barrier function. Furthermore, VAH mice showed more severe lung GVHD with increased donor T cell infiltration in this tissue and died significantly faster than VAN recipients. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples revealed significant differences in the diversity and composition of gut microbiota between VAN and VAH transplant recipients. Collectively, we show that retinoic acid signaling may negatively impact intestinal barrier function during GVHD. Mild vitamin A supplementation is associated with increased lung GVHD and more profound gut dysbiosis. Micronutrients such as vitamin A could modulate complications of allogeneic HSCT, which may be mediated by shaping gut microbiota.<sep>Abstract Objective Pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing problem, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We used transcriptomic reporter cell assays to investigate differences in transcriptional signatures induced in hepatocyte reporter cells by the sera of children with and without NAFLD. Methods We studied serum samples from 45 children with NAFLD and 28 children without NAFLD. The sera were used to induce gene expression in cultured HepaRG cells and RNA‐sequencing was used to determine gene expression. Computational techniques were used to compare gene expression patterns. Results Sera from children with NAFLD induced the expression of 195 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in hepatocytes compared to controls with obesity. NAFLD was associated with increased expression of genes promoting inflammation, collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Additionally, there was lower expression of genes involved in endobiotic and xenobiotic metabolism, and downregulation of peroxisome function, oxidative phosphorylation, and xenobiotic, bile acid, and fatty acid metabolism. A 13‐gene signature, including upregulation of TREM1 and MMP1 and downregulation of CYP2C9 , was consistently associated with all diagnostic categories of pediatric NAFLD. Conclusion The extracellular milieu of sera from children with NAFLD induced specific gene profiles distinguishable by a hepatocyte reporter system. Circulating factors may contribute to inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling and impair xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism in pediatric NAFLD.<sep>The soil-dwelling delta-proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus is a model organism to study predation and competition. M. xanthus preys on a broad range of bacteria mediated by lytic enzymes, exopolysaccharides, Type-IV pilus-based motility, and specialized metabolites. Competition between M. xanthus and prey bacterial strains with various specialized metabolite profiles indicates a range of fitness, suggesting that specialized metabolites contribute to prey survival. To expand our understanding of how specialized metabolites affect predator–prey dynamics, we assessed interspecies interactions between M. xanthus and two strains of Bacillus cereus . While strain ATCC 14579 resisted predation, strain T was found to be highly sensitive to M. xanthus predation. The interaction between B. cereus ATCC 14579 and M. xanthus appears to be competitive, resulting in population loss for both predator and prey. Genome analysis revealed that ATCC 14579 belongs to a clade that possesses the biosynthetic gene cluster for production of thiocillins, whereas B. cereus strain T lacks those genes. Further, purified thiocillin protects B. cereus strains unable to produce this specialized metabolite, strengthening the finding that thiocillin protects against predation and contributes to the ecological fitness of B. cereus ATCC 14579. Lastly, strains that produce thiocillin appear to confer some level of protection to their own antibiotic by encoding an additional copy of the L11 ribosomal protein, a known target for thiopeptides. This work highlights the importance of specialized metabolites affecting predator–prey dynamics in soil microenvironments.<sep>Percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation (PENFS) has documented efficacy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) via plausible vagal neuromodulation effects. The vagus nerve may affect gut microbiome composition via brain-gut-microbiome signaling. We aimed to investigate gut microbiome alterations by PENFS therapy in adolescent IBS patients.A prospective study of females with IBS aged 11-18 years receiving PENFS therapy for 4 weeks with pre- and post-intervention stool sampling was conducted. Outcome surveys completed pre-therapy, weekly, and post-therapy included IBS-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI), Functional Disability Inventory (FDI), and the global symptom response scale (SRS). Bacterial DNA was extracted from stool samples followed by 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing. QIIME 2 (version 2022.2) was used for analyses of α and β diversity and differential abundance by group.Twenty females aged 15.6 ± 1.62 years were included. IBS-SSS, VSI, and FDI scores decreased significantly after PENFS therapy (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0003, P = 0.0004, respectively). No intra- or interindividual microbiome changes were noted pre- versus post-therapy or between responders and non-responders. When response was defined by 50-point IBS-SSS score reduction, α diversity was higher in responders compared with non-responders at week 4 (P = 0.033). There was higher abundance of Blautia in excellent responders versus non-responders.There were no substantial microbial diversity alterations with PENFS. Subjects with excellent therapeutic response showed an enrichment of relative abundance of Blautia, which may indicate that patients with specific microbial signature have a more favorable response to PENFS.<sep>Bariatric surgery results in resolution of hypertension in over 50% of patients. While weight loss is a critical component to hypertension resolution after bariatric surgery, there may also be weight loss-independent mechanisms. We hypothesized that sleeve gastrectomy (SG) initiates changes in the gut microbiome which reduce postoperative blood pressure. Male, obese Zucker rats underwent SG, pair-fed sham, or ad-lib-fed sham surgery. Blood pressure measurements were performed 1 week pre-operatively, and at 2 and 6 weeks post-operatively. The stool microbiome composition was determined by 16S rDNA gene at 6 weeks post-operatively. Regression Random Forest modeling was performed to determine an association of the microbial composition with blood pressure. SG and pair-fed rats weighed significantly less than ad-lib-fed sham rats throughout the post-surgical period. At 6 weeks after surgery, SG rats had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure (149.2 ± 1.99 mmHg) than pair-fed (164.7 ± 7.87, p < 0.001) or ad-lib-fed sham rats (167.1 ± 2.41 mmHg, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in multiple measures of beta diversity between SG rats and pair-fed and ad-lib-fed sham rats. 45.11% of the difference in blood pressure variability between samples was explained with the regression Random Forest model. SG in a rat model prevented hypertension progression independent of weight loss with changes in beta diversity and gut bacterial composition associated with the blood pressure outcome. These findings further support the metabolic efficacy of SG in treating hyperglycemia, cardiac dysfunction, and now hypertension, independent of obesity class.<sep>BackgroundHead and neck cancer (HNC) surgery remains an important component of management but is associated with a high rate of surgical site infection (SSI). We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a topical mucosal antiseptic bundle in preventing SSI and evaluate microbial predictors of infection through a genomic sequencing approach.MethodsThis study was an open-label, single-arm, single-center, phase 2 trial of a topical mucosal antiseptic bundle in patients with HNC undergoing aerodigestive tract resection and reconstruction. Patients underwent topical preparation of the oral mucosa with povidone-iodine (PI) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) pre- and intra-operatively followed by oral tetracycline ointment every 6 hours for 2 days post-operatively. The primary outcome was change in bacterial bioburden at the oral surgical site. Secondary outcomes included safety, SSI, and microbial predictors of infection.FindingsOf 27 patients screened between January 8, 2021, and May 14, 2021, 26 were enrolled and 25 completed the study. There were no antiseptic-related adverse events. The topical mucosal antiseptic bundle significantly decreased oral bacterial colony-forming units from pre-operative levels (log10 mean difference 4·03, 95%CI 3·13–4·;92). There were three SSI (12%) within 30 days. In correlative genomic studies, a distinct set of amplicon sequence variants in the post-operative microbiome was associated with SSI. Further, despite no instance of post-operative orocervical fistula, metagenomic sequence mapping revealed the oral cavity as the origin of the infectious organism in two of the three SSI.InterpretationThe bacterial strains which subsequently caused SSI were frequently identified in the pre-operative oral cavity. Accordingly, a topical antiseptic bundle decreased oral bacterial bioburden throughout the peri-operative period and was associated with a low rate of SSI, supporting further study of topical antisepsis in HNC surgery.FundingAlliance Oncology.<sep>Farrowing crates have traditionally been used to reduce occurrence of piglet mortality as a result of sow crushing. However the utilisation of traditional farrowing crates has been suggested to contribute to negative welfare for both the sow and piglets. This study compared mortality rates, weight gain and behaviour of two cohorts, Freedom Farrowing (FF) and Traditional Farrowing (TF), of sows at a commercial farm. Results indicated no significant difference in mortality rates (2-sample t-test, t24 = −0.08, p = 0.761) between systems or in weight gain of piglets (batch 1: 2-sample t-test, t12=−0.01, p = 0.993; batch 2: 2-sample t-test, t12=−0.12, p = 0.904). Behaviour of sows indicated a number of significant differences between FF and TF cohorts including TF sows spending more time lying down, χ2 (2, N = 24) = 5.69, p = 0.017 and FF sows spending more time nursing their piglets χ2 (1, N = 24) = 6.66, p = 0.01, socialising with their piglets χ2 (2, N = 24) = 12, p = 0.001 and exploring the pen χ2 (2, N = 24) = 6, p = 0.014. TF piglets spent more time lying away from the sow (lying elsewhere) χ2 (2, N = 24) = 4.78, p = 0.029 and engaging in agonistic behaviours with other piglets χ2 (2, N = 24) = 4.76, p = 0.029, whilst FF piglets spent more time feeding from the sow χ2 (1, N = 24) = 63.18, p < 0.001 and playing with other piglets χ2 (2, N = 24) = 4.37, p = 0.036. As farmed production animals it is important that management changes to improve welfare consider both economic impacts and effect on production time; the results of this study demonstrate that both mortality rates and weight gain of piglets are comparable between the two systems giving an overall advantage to the implementation of Free Farrowing pens in a pig production environment.<sep>Kidney stone disease in children is rising disproportionate to the general population, representing a disease population with a distinct biological mechanism as compared to adults. Factors influencing recurrent kidney stone disease in children are poorly characterized and the associations of the intestinal microbiome within sub-populations of kidney stone formers, however, are not well described. We evaluated a pilot cohort of children with nephrolithiasis comparing patients based on recurrent kidney stone episodes and abnormal 24-h urinary parameters, with dual aims to compare the microbiome signal in children with initial and recurrent nephrolithiasis and to explore additional associations in microbiome composition and diversity within this population.Children aged 6-18 with a history of nephrolithiasis, without an active ureteral calculus or antibiotic exposure within 30 days of study entry were eligible to participate. All participants had a 24-h urine study within 6 months of study entry and provided a fecal sample. Microbiome samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing techniques for alpha and beta diversity comparing initial and recurrent stone formers as well as microbiome multivariate association (MaAsLin2) to determine differentially abundant taxa. Shotgun sequencing reads were aligned to custom oxidase degradation and butyrate production gene databases (5 databases total). Comparisons for MaAsLin2 and shotgun metagenomics, normalized to sequencing depth, were based on stone recurrence, sex, hypercalcuria (≤4 mg/kg/day), hyperoxaluria (≥45 mg/1.73 m2), and hypocitraturia (<310 mg/1.73 m2 [females] or < 365 mg/1.73 m2 [males]).A total of 16 enrolled children provided samples sufficient for analyses, including 9 girls and 7 boys, of whom 5 had experienced recurrent kidney stone events. Three participants had hypercalcuria, 2 had hyperoxaluria, and 4 had hypocitraturia. Comparisons of Formyl-CoA transferase between index and recurrent urinary stone disease revealed a trend towards higher mean abundance of the gene in initial stone formers (0.166% vs 0.0343%, p = 0.2847) (Summary Figure), while trends toward lower biodiversity were also noted in the recurrent stone cohort on both Faith (p = 0.06) and Shannon (p = 0.05) indices. Exploratory analyses found Eubacterium siraeum to be significantly greater in relative abundance in children with documented hypercalciuria (p = 0.001).Our pilot study demonstrates possible signals in both microbial diversity and oxalate gene expression, both of which are lower in recurrent pediatric kidney stone patients. These findings warrant further investigation as a potential diagnostic marker for future kidney stone events.<sep>The gut microbiome plays an essential role in host energy homeostasis and influences the development of obesity and related conditions. Studies demonstrate that nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation for diet-induced obesity (DIO) reduces weight gain and increases energy expenditure in mice. NR is a vitamin B3 derivative and an NAD+ precursor with potential for treating human diseases arising from mitochondrial degeneration, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Gut bacteria produce vitamin B3 in the colon and are capable of salvaging and metabolizing vitamin B3 and its derivatives. However, it is unknown how dietary supplementation of NR alters the microbiome and if those alterations contribute to deflection of weight gain. In this study, we fed C57BL/6J male mice a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with or without NR and performed a fecal material transfer (FMT) to establish a link between NR-conditioned microbiota and NR-induced deflection of weight gain. FMT from NR-treated donors to naive mice fed a HFD was sufficient to deflect weight gain by increasing energy expenditure. We also investigated the effects of NR on the microbiome by using metagenomics sequencing. We found that NR-treated mice displayed an altered gut microbial composition relative to controls and that fecal transplant resulted in a distinct functional metabolic profile characterized by enrichment of butyrate-producing Firmicutes. NR-treated donors and subsequent FMT recipients share a similar enrichment of metagenomic biomarkers relative to controls. These findings suggest that microbial factors contribute to the beneficial effects of dietary NR supplementation, which may be useful to enhance the therapeutic effects of NR. IMPORTANCE With obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) at epidemic levels, we need to understand the complex nature of these diseases to design better therapeutics. The underlying causes of both obesity and T2D are complex, but both are thought to develop, in part, based on contributions from the gut microbiota. Nicotinamide riboside is a gut-derived vitamin B3 derivative and NAD+ precursor which has the potential to treat and prevent metabolic disorders by ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding how NR affects the gut microbiome and whether NR-conditioned microbiota contributes to weight loss in the host would (i) improve diagnosis and treatments for obesity and other metabolic pathologies, (ii) tailor treatments to satisfy the needs of each individual moving toward the future of precision medicine, and (iii) benefit other scientific fields that currently investigate the effects of NR in other disease pathologies.</abstract>", "<keyword>Ćuk converter<sep>Gesture recognition<sep>Automatic summarization<sep>Fault (geology)<sep>Artificial neural network<sep>Deep learning<sep>Forward secrecy<sep>Switched capacitor<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Demographics<sep>Converters<sep>Low voltage<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Biomaterial<sep>Set (abstract data type)<sep>Liver cancer<sep>Segmentation<sep>Radio-frequency identification<sep>Authentication (law)<sep>Production (economics)<sep>Overcurrent<sep>Scarcity<sep>Testbed<sep>Support vector machine<sep>Agriculture<sep>Voltage multiplier<sep>Desalination<sep>Word2vec<sep>Nexus (standard)<sep>Induction motor<sep>Questions and answers<sep>Pandemic<sep>Feature selection<sep>Voltage<sep>Magnetic resonance imaging<sep>Transceiver<sep>Tin oxide<sep>Forward converter<sep>Tripping<sep>Classifier (UML)<sep>Ripening<sep>Trigram<sep>Network topology<sep>Transformer<sep>High-resolution transmission electron microscopy<sep>Photothermal therapy<sep>Ranking (information retrieval)<sep>Salience (neuroscience)<sep>Total harmonic distortion<sep>Identification (biology)<sep>Melamine<sep>Capacitor<sep>Node (physics)<sep>Pattern recognition (psychology)<sep>Thin film<sep>Body area network<sep>Energy storage<sep>Distributed generation<sep>Wireless sensor network<sep>Liver tumor<sep>Boost converter<sep>Control theory (sociology)<sep>Coating<sep>Topology (electrical circuits)<sep>Smart grid<sep>Relay<sep>Backup<sep>Cryptographic protocol<sep>Cryptography<sep>Solar energy<sep>Cluster analysis<sep>Pose<sep>Electricity<sep>Convolutional neural network<sep>Buck–boost converter<sep>Food security<sep>Circuit breaker<sep>Fouling<sep>Analytics<sep>Gesture</keyword><title>A Voltage Multiplier Circuit Based Quadratic Boost Converter for Energy Storage Application<sep>Generalized Structures for Switched-Capacitor Multilevel Inverter Topology for Energy Storage System Application<sep>A New High Voltage Gain DC to DC Converter with Low Voltage Stress for Energy Storage System Application<sep>Radio-Frequency-Identification-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation Using Knowledge-Level Technique<sep>Liver-Tumor Detection Using CNN ResUNet<sep>Super Hydrophilic Activated Carbon Decorated Nanopolymer Foam for Scalable, Energy Efficient Photothermal Steam Generation, as an Effective Desalination System<sep>Machine Learning Approach for Answer Detection in Discussion Forums: An Application of Big Data Analytics<sep>Low-cost green recyclable biomaterial for energy-dependent electrical switching and intact biofilm with antibacterial properties<sep>A Novel Switched-Capacitor Multilevel Inverter Topology for Energy Storage and Smart Grid Applications<sep>Sustainable production and waste management policies for COVID-19 medical equipment under uncertainty: A case study analysis<sep>Dynamic Key Extraction Technique Using Pulse Signal and Lightweight Cryptographic Authentication Scheme for WBAN<sep>Hand Gesture Recognition with Symmetric Pattern under Diverse Illuminated Conditions Using Artificial Neural Network<sep>A Hybrid Framework of Deep Learning Techniques to Predict Online Performance of Learners during COVID-19 Pandemic<sep>Summarizing Online Movie Reviews: A Machine Learning Approach to Big Data Analytics<sep>Multiple Industrial Induction Motors Fault Diagnosis Model within Powerline System Based on Wireless Sensor Network<sep>Xbee-Based WSN Architecture for Monitoring of Banana Ripening Process Using Knowledge-Level Artificial Intelligent Technique<sep>A Robust Neutrosophic Modeling and Optimization Approach for Integrated Energy-Food-Water Security Nexus Management under Uncertainty<sep>An approach to disparage the blindness of backup protection in grid connected renewable energy sources system by inducing artificial fault current<sep>User-Defined Dual Setting Directional Overcurrent Relays with Hybrid Time Current-Voltage Characteristics-Based Protection Coordination for Active Distribution Network</title><abstract>In this paper, a new transformerless high voltage gain dc-dc converter is proposed for low and medium power application. The proposed converter has high quadratic gain and utilizes only two inductors to achieve this gain. It has two switches that are operated simultaneously, making control of the converter easy. The proposed converter’s output voltage gain is higher than the conventional quadratic boost converter and other recently proposed high gain quadratic converters. A voltage multiplier circuit (VMC) is integrated with the proposed converter, which significantly increases the converter’s output voltage. Apart from a high output voltage, the proposed converter has low voltage stress across switches and capacitors, which is a major advantage of the proposed topology. A hardware prototype of 200 W of the proposed converter is developed in the laboratory to validate the converter’s performance. The efficiency of the converter is obtained through PLECS software by incorporating the switching and conduction losses.<sep>The apparent advantages of Multilevel Inverter (MLI) topologies in handling medium and high power with less loss in switching and lower harmonic distortion in an output voltage waveform makes it better than the conventional inverter. However, the MLI topologies utilize a large number of DC power supplies and power semiconductor devices. They also have a higher value of total standing voltage (TSV). Moreover, capacitor voltage balancing problems, self-voltage boosting inability, and complex control techniques require a relook and improvement in their structure. More recently, Switched-Capacitor Multilevel Inverter (SCMLI) topologies have been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of MLIs. In this paper, a generalized structure for a single-phase switched capacitor multilevel inverter (SCMLI) with self-voltage boosting and self-voltage balancing capability is proposed. A detailed analysis of a general structure of SCMLI is presented. The comparative analysis of the structures is carried out with recently reported topologies to demonstrate superiority. An optimized low-frequency modulation controls the output voltage waveform. The simulation and experimental results are included in the paper for single-unit symmetric (9-level voltage) and asymmetric (17-level voltage) configurations.<sep>Increasing energy demand globally has led to exploring ways of utilizing renewable resources for sustainable development. More recently, the integration of renewable distributed resources in small- and large-scale grid has been seriously researched. Development in renewable power sources and its integration with the grid require voltage level conversion to match the grid/micro-grid level. The voltage level conversion is brought about by employing Direct Current-Direct Current (DC-DC) converters with boosting features. The paper presents a wide gain range DC-DC boost converter with a low-stress on switching devices. The proposed converter’s voltage gain is high compared with the conventional quadratic boost converter and other recently developed high gain boost converters. The topology has been compared with recently proposed topologies, and comparative analysis based on various performance parameters has shown that the topology is suitable for renewable and sustainable energy storage and grid integration. The power loss analysis has been done by incorporating the switching and conduction losses. A hardware prototype of 150 W has been developed to validate the converter’s performance in steady-state as well as in dynamic conditions.<sep>Human pose recognition is a new field of study that promises to have widespread practical applications. While there have been efforts to improve human position estimation with radio frequency identification (RFID), no major research has addressed the problem of predicting full-body poses. Therefore, a system that can determine the human pose by analyzing the entire human body, from the head to the toes, is required. This paper presents a 3D human pose recognition framework based on ANN for learning error estimation. A workable laboratory-based multisensory testbed has been developed to verify the concept and validation of results. A case study was discussed to determine the conditions under which an acceptable estimation rate can be achieved in pose analysis. Using the Butterworth filtering technique, environmental factors are de-noised to reduce the system’s computational cost. The acquired signal is then segmented using an adaptive moving average technique to determine the beginning and ending points of an activity, and significant features are extracted to estimate the activity of each human pose. Experiments demonstrate that RFID transceiver-based solutions can be used effectively to estimate a person’s pose in real time using the proposed method.<sep>Liver tumor is the fifth most occurring type of tumor in men and the ninth most occurring type of tumor in women according to recent reports of Global cancer statistics 2018. There are several imaging tests like Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and ultrasound that can diagnose the liver tumor after taking the sample from the tissue of the liver. These tests are costly and time-consuming. This paper proposed that image processing through deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) ResUNet model that can be helpful for the early diagnose of tumor instead of conventional methods. The existing studies have mainly used the two Cascaded CNNs for liver segmentation and evaluation of Region Of Interest (ROI). This study uses ResUNet, an updated version of U-Net and ResNet Models that utilize the service of Residential blocks. We apply over method on the 3D-IRCADb01 dataset that is based on CT slices of liver tumor affected patients. The results showed the True Value Accuracy around 99% and F1 score performance around 95%. This method will be helpful for early and accurate diagnose of the Liver tumor to save the lives of many patients in the field of Biotechnology.<sep>Clean water scarcity is still an intense, prolonged global issue that needs to be resolved urgently. The solar steam generation has shown great potential with a high energy conversion efficiency for clean water production from seawater and wastewater. However, the high evaporation rate of water cannot be preserved due to the inevitable fouling of solar absorbers. Herein, a self-floatable and super hydrophilic solar-driven steam generator composed of activated carbon coated melamine foam (ACM). The deposited ACM photothermal layer exhibits outstanding solar absorption (92%) and an efficient evaporation rate of 1.27 kg m−2 h−1, along with excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (80%) as compared to commercially available primitive solar stills. The open porous assembly of melamine foam equipped with 80% flexibility (0.8 MPa) enabled smooth water transport and sustain heat accumulation within the matrix. The thermal insulation of ACM is 10 times greater than pure water. Moreover, open porous assembly of designed solar-powered steam generator rejects salt ions as well as volatile organic compounds efficiently. The low-cost and facile fabrication of photothermal based water production presents a potential solution to single step drinking water supply from various resources of the sea, the lakes and mixtures of emulsified oil and industrial<sep>Nowadays, data are flooding into online web forums, and it is highly desirable to turn gigantic amount of data into actionable knowledge. Online web forums have become an integral part of the web and are main sources of knowledge. People use this platform to post their questions and get answers from other forum members. Usually, an initial post (question) gets more than one reply posts (answers) that make it difficult for a user to scan all of them for most relevant and quality answer. Thus, how to automatically extract the most relevant answer for a question within a thread is an important issue. In this research, we treat the task of answer extraction as classification problem. A reply post can be classified as relevant, partially relevant, or irrelevant to the initial post. To find the relevancy/similarity of a reply to the question, both lexical and nonlexical features are used. We proposed to use LinearSVC, a variant of support vector machine (SVM), for answer classification. Two selection techniques such as chi-square and univariate are employed to reduce the feature space size. The experimental results showed that LinearSVC classifier outperformed the other state-of-the-art classifiers in the context of classification accuracy<sep>Abstract A highly cost-effective recycled biomaterial extracted from lime peel has been made biocompatible and has been coated on a commercial fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate of glass using the spin coating method. Structural, morphologic, electronic, and antibacterial measurements were thoroughly characterized as a green biomaterial thin film using X-rays (XRD), PL, FTIR, Raman, SEM, HRTEM, AFM, I–V, and antibacterial diffusion techniques. The comprehensive analysis of structures of recyclable waste in the form of lime peel extract (LPE) as thin films showed the crystalline cellulose structure that corresponds to the lattice fringe (0.342 nm) exposed by HRTEM. The K +1 interstitial active sites or vacancies in LPE/FTO thin films are confirmed by the PL spectra that show important evidence about conduction mechanisms, and hence facilitates Ag +1 ion migration from the top to the bottom electrode. The AFM investigations revealed the minor surface roughness (169.61 nm) of the LPE/FTO film, which controls the current leakage that is associated with surface defects. The designed memory cell (Ag/LPE/FTO) exhibits stable, reproducible electrical switching under low operational voltage and is equipped with excellent retention over 5 × 10 3 s. Furthermore, owing to presence of flavonoids and their superior antioxidant nature,<sep>The recent advancement in the application of the internet of things in the smart grid has led to an industrial revolution in the power industry. The Industry 4.0 revolution has already set in, allowing computers to interact for an efficient and intelligent approach in solving smart grid issues. multilevel inverters (MLIs) are an integral part of the smart grid system for integrating the distributed generation sources and storage energy systems into the smart grid. It attracted attention in industrial applications as they can handle high power and high voltage with an inherent feature of superior output voltage waveform quality. Moreover, its variant, the switched-capacitor MLI (SCMLI), has the added benefit of lesser DC supply requirement. In this paper, a switched-capacitor multilevel inverter topology has been proposed, which can operate in symmetric and asymmetric mode. The proposed SCMLI generate thirteen and thirty-one level output voltages for symmetric and asymmetric selection of DC voltage sources, respectively. The proposed SCMLI has a smaller number of switching devices for a given output voltage level as compared to other recently proposed topologies. A thorough comparison is presented with the recently proposed topologies on several parameters, including cost function. To validate the proposed topology,<sep>Unfortunately, an abrupt corona-virus disease (COVID-19) outbreak brought a drastic change in human lives. Almost every sector of human-beings and their related activities are severely infected and affected by this COVID-19 pandemic. As days are passing, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic is going to be more severe. The fundamental needs for personal protective equipment (PPEs) are rising drastically all over the world. In India, many non-pharmaceutical companies or organizations such as automobile companies are engaged in producing the PPEs at a very marginal rate. Thus this paper proposes a modeling and optimization framework for sustainable production and waste management (SPWM) decision-making model for COVID-19 medical equipment under uncertainty. To quantify the uncertainties among parameter values, we have taken advantage of the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory. A robust ranking function is presented to obtain a crisp version of it. Furthermore, a novel interactive intuitionistic fuzzy programming approach is developed to solve the proposed SPWM model. An ample opportunity to generate the desired solution sets are also depicted. The performance analysis based on multiple criteria such as savings from baseline, co-efficient of variations, and desirability degrees is also introduced. Practical managerial implications are also discussed based on the significant<sep>As a key component of ubiquitous computing, the wireless body area network (WBAN) can be used in a variety of disciplines, including health monitoring. Our everyday routines have been transformed by wearable technology, which has changed the medical industry and made our lives more convenient. However, the openness of the wireless network has raised concerns about the privacy and security of patient’s data because of the latent threat imposed by attackers. Patients’ sensitive data are safeguarded with authentication schemes against a variety of cyberattacks. Using pulse signals and a lightweight cryptographic approach, we propose a hybrid, anonymous, authentication scheme by extracting the binarized stream (bio-key) from pulse signal. We acquired 20 different sample signals to verify the unpredictability and randomness of keys, which were further utilized in an authentication algorithm. Formal proof of mutual authentication and key agreement was provided by the widely known BAN logic, and informal verification was provided by the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The performance results depicted that storage cost on the sensor side was only 640 b, whereas communication cost was 512 b. Similarly, the computation time and energy consumption requirements were 0.005 ms and 0.55 µJ,<sep>This paper investigated the effects of variant lighting conditions on the recognition process. A framework is proposed to improve the performance of gesture recognition under variant illumination using the luminosity method. To prove the concept, a workable testbed has been developed in the laboratory by using a Microsoft Kinect sensor to capture the depth images for the purpose of acquiring diverse resolution data. For this, a case study was formulated to achieve an improved accuracy rate in gesture recognition under diverse illuminated conditions. For data preparation, American Sign Language (ASL) was used to create a dataset of all twenty-six signs, evaluated in real-time under diverse lighting conditions. The proposed method uses a set of symmetric patterns as a feature set in order to identify human hands and recognize gestures extracted through hand perimeter feature-extraction methods. A Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is used in the identification of significant key points of ASL-based images with their relevant features. Finally, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on symmetric patterns under different lighting environments was used to classify hand gestures utilizing selected features for validation. The experimental results showed that the proposed system performed well in diverse lighting effects with multiple pixel<sep>COVID-19’s rapid spread has disrupted educational initiatives. Schools worldwide have been implementing more possibilities for distance learning because of the worldwide epidemic of the COVID-19 virus, and Pakistan is no exception. However, this has resulted in several problems for students, including reduced access to technology, apathy, and unstable internet connections. It has become more challenging due to the rapid change to evaluate students’ academic development in a remote setting. A hybrid deep learning approach has been presented to evaluate the effectiveness of online education in Pakistan’s fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. Through the use of multiple data sources, including the demographics of students, online activity, learning patterns, and assessment results, this study seeks to realize the goal of precision education. The proposed research makes use of a dataset of Pakistani learners that was compiled during the COVID-19 pandemic. To properly assess the complex and heterogeneous data associated with online learning, the proposed framework employs several deep learning techniques, including 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. With the 98.8% accuracy rate for the trained model, it was clear that the deep learning framework could beat the performance of any other models currently in use.<sep>Information is exploding on the web at exponential pace, and online movie review over the web is a substantial source of information for online users. However, users write millions of movie reviews on regular basis, and it is not possible for users to condense the reviews. Classification and summarization of reviews is a difficult task in computational linguistics. Hence, an automatic method is demanded to summarize the vast amount of movie reviews, and this method will permit the users to speedily distinguish between positive and negative features of a movie. This work has proposed a classification and summarization method for movie reviews. For movie review classification, bag-of-words feature extraction technique is used to extract unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as a feature set from given review documents and represent the review documents as a vector. Next, the Na¨ıve Bayes algorithm is employed to categorize the movie reviews (signified as a feature vector) into negative and positive reviews. For the task of movie review summarization, word2vec model is used to extract features from classified movie review sentences, and then semantic clustering technique is used to cluster semantically related review sentences. Different text features are employed to compute the salience score<sep>The voltage supply of induction motors of various sizes is typically provided by a shared power bus in an industrial production powerline network. A single motor’s dynamic behavior produces a signal that travels along the powerline. Powerline networks are efficient at transmitting and receiving signals. This could be an indication that there is a problem with the motor down immediately from its location. It is possible for the consolidated network signal to become confusing. A mathematical model is used to measure and determine the possible known routing of various signals in an electricity network based on attenuation and estimate the relationship between sensor signals and known fault patterns. A laboratory WSN based induction motors testbed setup was developed using Xbee devices and microcontroller along with the variety of different-sized motors to verify the progression of faulty signals and identify the type of fault. These motors were connected in parallel to the main powerline through this architecture, which provided an excellent concept for an industrial multi-motor network modeling lab setup. A method for the extraction of Xbee node-level features has been developed, and it can be applied to a variety of datasets. The accuracy of the real-time data capture<sep>Real-time monitoring of fruit ripeness in storage and during logistics allows traders to minimize the chances of financial losses and maximize the quality of the fruit during storage through accurate prediction of the present condition of fruits. In Pakistan, banana production faces different difficulties from production, post-harvest management, and trade marketing due to atmosphere and mismanagement in storage containers. In recent research development, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are progressively under investigation in the field of fruit ripening due to their remote monitoring capability. Focused on fruit ripening monitoring, this paper demonstrates an Xbee-based wireless sensor nodes network. The role of the network architecture of the Xbee sensor node and sink end-node is discussed in detail regarding their ability to monitor the condition of all the required diagnosis parameters and stages of banana ripening. Furthermore, different features are extracted using the gas sensor, which is based on diverse values. These features are utilized for training in the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) through the Back Propagation (BP) algorithm for further data validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the projected WSN architecture can identify the banana condition in the storage area. The proposed Neural Network (NN) architectural design works well with<sep>Natural resources are a boon for human beings, and their conservation for future uses is indispensable. Most importantly, energy-food-water security (EFWS) nexus management is the utmost need of our time. An effective managerial policy for the current distribution and conservation to meet future demand is necessary and challenging. Thus, this paper investigates an interconnected and dynamic EFWS nexus optimization model by considering the socio-economic and environmental objectives with the optimal energy supply, electricity conversion, food production, water resources allocation, and CO2 emissions control in the multi-period time horizons. Due to real-life complexity, various parameters are taken as intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. A novel method called interactive neutrosophic programming approach (INPA) is suggested to solve the EFWS nexus model. To verify and validate the proposed EFWS model, a synthetic computational study is performed. The obtained solution results are compared with other optimization approaches, and the outcomes are also evaluated with significant practical implications. The study reveals that the food production processes require more water resources than electricity production, although recycled water has not been used for food production purposes. The use of a coal-fired plant is not a prominent electricity conversion source. However, natural gas power plants’ service is also<sep>The renewable energy sources based distributed generation is increasingly penetrating into conventional distribution network . Aside from the technical and economical benefits, distributed generation may incapacitate the sensitivity of backup protection devices , which may face partial blindness in grid-connected, even full blindness in islanded mode of operation and during high impedance faults. This paper proposes a novel stratagem to completely plummet the blindness of backup relay by inducing the artificial fault current. A blindness severity index is developed to induce artificial fault current in a controlled manner according to blindness severity. Two methods are proposed. First, the OCR vulnerable to blindness is provided with an auxiliary current transformer, whose output is tuned in conjunction with blindness severity index and merged with main current transformer’s output to modulate its secondary current responsible for sensitivity. Second, the microprocessor based relay is used and the time current characteristics is modified by augmenting a new variable named as artificial fault current factor to scale the fault current. As, the current is increased by the TCC modification and no external equipment is added here, so named as AFC. To assure that the AFC is induced only in fault event and to prevent<sep>With the penetration of renewable energy sources based distributed generation (RES-DG) in the distribution network (DN), the operating time of protection relays becomes a major concern to avoid the mis-coordination and nuisance tripping of RES-DG. It is due to the bidirectional flow of current, variance in the fault current level, i.e. high fault current in case of Squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) based RES-DG, and low fault current for an inverter-based RES-DGs. This paper proposes a novel User-defined dual setting direction overcurrent relay with hybrid time current-voltage (UDDOR-TCV) characteristics to intensify the proposed scheme’s flexibility without any communication assistance for radial DN. The proposed model is formulated in a constrained non-linear optimization fashion and solved with the MINLP solver of general algebraic modelling system(GAMS) software to determine the optimal relay settings. The propounded protection scheme is simulated on IEEE-33 bus radial distribution system and a local 40-bus system hosting the multiple SCIG and PV based RES-DGs at optimal locations. Detailed numerical studies are carried out to show the performance of the proposed scheme. 66.848% and 68.26% reduction in relay operation time with zero mis-coordination is achieved with SCIG-WTG case and PV-units case for the IEEE-33 bus system and</abstract>"]}

However, running a basic NMF analysis requires the installation of multiple tools and dependencies, along with a steep learning curve and computing time. To mitigate such obstacles, we developed ShinyButchR, a novel R/Shiny application that provides a complete NMF-based analysis workflow, allowing the user to perform matrix decomposition using NMF, feature extraction, interactive visualization, relevant signature identification, and association to biological and clinical variables.

However, comprehensive data resources for cell line-specific transcription factor-to-target gene annotations are currently limited. To address this, we developed a straightforward method to define regulons that capture the cell-specific aspects of TF binding and transcript expression levels. By integrating cellular transcriptome and transcription factor binding data, we generated regulons for four common cell lines comprising both proximal and distal cell line-specific regulatory events. Through systematic benchmarking involving transcription factor knockout experiments, we demonstrated performance on par with state-of-the-art methods, with our method being easily applicable to other cell types of interest. We present case studies using three cancer single-cell datasets to showcase the utility of these cell-type-specific regulons in exploring transcriptional dysregulation. In summary, this study provides a valuable tool and a resource for systematically exploring cell line-specific transcriptional regulations, emphasizing the utility of network analysis in deciphering disease mechanisms.<sep>Background: Heart failure represents the end-stage of a range of diseases which adversely impact the heart muscle. The extent by which cellular and molecular mechanisms differ between myocardial diseases in heart failure remains incompletely understood. Methods: We performed isolation and droplet-based RNA-sequencing of 394 247 single nuclei from 103 explanted hearts from transplant and ventricular assist device recipients and 7 unused donor hearts without heart disease. After sample and nuclei level quality control, doublet removal and sample integration; principal component analysis and shared nearest neighbor clustering were used to identify distinct cell populations. Cell type composition and transcriptomic profiles were compared across donor hearts and 10 myocardial diseases (hypertrophic, dilated, ischemic, restrictive, arrythmogenic and non-compaction cardiomyopathy; rheumatic and congenital heart disease; cardiac amyloidosis and graft rejection; n=1-45/group). Results: We identified and manually annotated 14 distinct cell populations that were present across controls and myocardial diseases, including transcriptionally diverse subgroups of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes. Compared to controls, we observed disease-specific differences in cell populations with regards to composition, heterogeneity, and specific transcriptional profiles. Conclusions: Our results reveal differences in single cell profiles of individual heart muscle diseases compared to controls without heart disease.<sep>Splicing of genomic exons into mRNAs is a critical prerequisite for the accurate synthesis of human proteins. Genetic variants impacting splicing underlie a substantial proportion of genetic disease, but are challenging to identify beyond those occurring at donor and acceptor dinucleotides. To address this, various methods aim to predict variant effects on splicing. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achieve better results in predicting splice variants than other strategies.It has been unclear how best to integrate such process-specific scores into genome-wide variant effect predictors. Here, we use a recently published experimental data set to compare several machine learning methods that score variant effects on splicing. We integrate the best of those approaches into general variant effect prediction models and observe the effect on classification of known pathogenic variants.We integrate two specialized splicing scores into CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion; cadd.gs.washington.edu ), a widely used tool for genome-wide variant effect prediction that we previously developed to weight and integrate diverse collections of genomic annotations. With this new model, CADD-Splice, we show that inclusion of splicing DNN effect scores substantially improves predictions across multiple variant categories, without compromising overall performance.While splice effect scores show superior performance on splice variants, specialized predictors cannot compete with other variant scores in general variant interpretation, as the latter account for nonsense and missense effects that do not alter splicing. Although only shown here for splice scores, we believe that the applied approach will generalize to other specific molecular processes, providing a path for the further improvement of genome-wide variant effect prediction.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Germplasm<sep>Quantitative trait locus<sep>Phenology<sep>Fusarium<sep>Hyperspectral imaging<sep>Single-nucleotide polymorphism<sep>Phenome<sep>Genomic information<sep>Trait<sep>Cultivar<sep>Scale (ratio)<sep>Selection (genetic algorithm)<sep>Genotype<sep>Resistance (ecology)<sep>Linear regression<sep>Marker-assisted selection<sep>Phenomics<sep>Genome<sep>Predictive modelling<sep>Genomic selection<sep>Population<sep>Variation (astronomy)<sep>Plant biochemistry<sep>Common wheat<sep>Race (biology)<sep>Yield (engineering)<sep>Gluten<sep>Hardiness (plants)<sep>Genetic diversity<sep>Rust (programming language)<sep>Set (abstract data type)<sep>Genetic gain<sep>Plant breeding<sep>Genome-wide association study<sep>Plant disease resistance<sep>Genotyping<sep>Frost (temperature)<sep>Genomics<sep>Line (geometry)<sep>Resource (disambiguation)<sep>Protein quality<sep>Gene</keyword><title>Genomic signatures of selection for resistance to stripe rust in Austrian winter wheat<sep>Balancing selection gain and genetic diversity in the genomic planning of crosses<sep>Mitigating the impact of selective phenotyping in training populations on the prediction ability by multi‐trait pedigree and genomic selection models<sep>Dissecting the Contribution of Environmental Influences, Plant Phenology, and Disease Resistance to Improving Genomic Predictions for Fusarium Head Blight Resistance in Wheat<sep>Multi-Year Dynamics of Single-Step Genomic Prediction in an Applied Wheat Breeding Program<sep>Genomic selection of parents and crosses beyond the native gene pool of a breeding program<sep>Genetic dissection of resistance to stripe rust in current Central and Northern European winter wheat germplasm<sep>Improving the efficiency of multi-location field trials with complete and incomplete relationship information<sep>Improving and Maintaining Winter Hardiness and Frost Tolerance in Bread Wheat by Genomic Selection<sep>Simultaneous selection for grain yield and protein content in genomics-assisted wheat breeding<sep>Genome-wide association study and genomic prediction of resistance to stripe rust in current Central and Northern European winter wheat germplasm<sep>Genome‐wide association mapping for pre‐harvest sprouting in European winter wheat detects novel resistance QTL, pleiotropic effects, and structural variation in multiple genomes<sep>Predictor bias in genomic and phenomic selection<sep>Toward combining qualitative race-specific and quantitative race-nonspecific disease resistance by genomic selection<sep>Genotyping crossing parents and family bulks can facilitate cost-efficient genomic prediction strategies in small-scale line breeding programs<sep>Combining grain yield, protein content and protein quality by multi-trait genomic selection in bread wheat</title><abstract>We combined quantitative and population genetic methods to identify loci under selection for adult plant resistance to stripe rust in an Austrian winter wheat breeding population from 2008 to 2018. Resistance to stripe rust, a foliar disease caused by the fungus P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is both qualitatively and quantitatively controlled. Resistance genes confer complete, race-specific resistance but are easily overcome by evolving pathogen populations, while quantitative resistance is controlled by many small- to medium-effect loci that provide incomplete yet more durable protection. Data on resistance loci can be applied in marker-assisted selection and genomic prediction frameworks. We employed genome-wide association to detect loci associated with stripe rust and selection testing to identify regions of the genome that underwent selection for stripe rust resistance in an Austrian winter wheat breeding program from 2008 to 2018. Genome-wide association mapping identified 150 resistance loci, 62 of which showed significant evidence of selection over time. The breeding population also demonstrated selection for resistance at the genome-wide level.<sep>Abstract Creating new genetic variation by crossing two or more parents is the initial and often most important step when developing new crop varieties. Hence, several mate selection indices have been suggested to support the planning of crosses in genomic breeding pipelines that have been established in many breeding programmes in recent years. The corresponding index weights are however difficult to determine objectively, and these indices often feature weights determined by laborious grid searches or rules of thumb. The aim of this study was to compare methods that employ the latter approach with mate selection indices based on desired gains in simulations and an empirical Fusarium head blight experiment for winter wheat. The results indicated that the suggested desired gain indices outperform routinely used methods in terms of reaching a favourable balance between the short‐term selection gain, long‐term selection gain, as well as the genetic diversity. They might have beyond that a high prospect for making a broader spectrum of genetic diversity accessible in the framework of germplasm exchange between breeding programmes.<sep>Abstract Training populations for pedigree and genomic prediction in plant breeding programmes are largely updated with superior genotypes from multi‐environment trials, where they are tested with the goal of variety development. Such a selective phenotyping has, however, a negative impact on prediction abilities, especially when only a subset of breeding lines can be tested, as for laborious and costly to phenotype traits. This study focused, thus, on investigating the impact of selective phenotyping in the training population of an applied wheat breeding programme, and assessing the potential to mitigate this impact by pedigree and genomic multi‐trait prediction models as well as bi‐directionally selected training populations for several baking quality parameters. Combining both pedigree and genomic information in multi‐trait prediction models with pre‐existing phenotypic information for protein content and sedimentation value compensated for the observed loss in prediction ability, while entering few inferior breeding lines into the training population further mitigated the impact of selective phenotyping and even led to a slight increase of prediction ability in comparison to a randomly chosen training population.<sep>Environmental factors like temperature and humidity are presumed to greatly influence Fusarium head blight FHB infections in wheat. Anther retention AR, on the other hand, is a morphologically neutral trait that shares a common genetic basis with FHB resistance. In this study, our aims were to: (i) Evaluate two types of corrections of FHB severity scores, namely method-1 via linear regression on flowering time (FT), and method-2 via a best-subset multiple linear regression analysis comprising FT plus accumulated thermal time variables; and (ii) assess the performance of multi-trait genomic selection (MT.GS) models for FHB severity assisted by AR. The forward prediction scenarios where GS models were trained with data from the previous years revealed average prediction accuracies (PA) of 0.28, 0.33, and 0.36 for FHB severity scores that were uncorrected or corrected by method-1 and method-2, respectively. FHB severity scores free from the influences of both environment and phenology seemed to be the most efficient trait to be predicted across different seasons. Average PA increments up to 1.9-fold were furthermore obtained for the MT.GS models, evidencing the feasibility of using AR as an assisting trait to improve the genomic selection of FHB resistance breeding lines.<sep>The availability of cost-efficient genotyping technologies has facilitated the implementation of genomic selection into numerous breeding programs. However, some studies reported a superiority of pedigree over genomic selection in line breeding, and as, aside from systematic record keeping, no additional costs are incurring in pedigree-based prediction, the question about the actual benefit of fingerprinting several hundred lines each year might suggest itself. This study aimed thus on shedding some light on this question by comparing pedigree, genomic, and single-step prediction models using phenotypic and genotypic data that has been collected during a time period of ten years in an applied wheat breeding program. The mentioned models were for this purpose empirically tested in a multi-year forward prediction as well as a supporting simulation study. Given the availability of deep pedigree records, pedigree prediction performed similar to genomic prediction for some of the investigated traits if preexisting information of the selection candidates was available. Notwithstanding, blending both information sources increased the prediction accuracy and thus the selection gain substantially, especially for low heritable traits. Nevertheless, the largest advantage of genomic predictions can be seen for breeding scenarios where such preexisting information is not systemically available or difficult and costly to obtain.<sep>Genomic selection has become a valuable tool for selecting cultivar candidates in many plant breeding programs. Genomic selection of elite parents and crossing combinations with germplasm developed outside a breeding program has, however, hardly been explored until now. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of this method for commonly ranking and selecting elite germplasm developed within and beyond a given breeding program. A winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) population consisting of 611 in-house and 87 externally developed lines was used to compare training population compositions and statistical models for genomically predicting baking quality in this framework. Augmenting training populations with lines from other breeding programs had a larger influence on the prediction ability than adding in-house generated lines when aiming to commonly rank both germplasm sets. Exploiting preexisting information of secondary correlated traits resulted likewise in more accurate predictions both in empirical analyses and simulations. Genotyping germplasm developed beyond a given breeding program is moreover a convenient way to clarify its relationships with a breeder's own germplasm because pedigree information is oftentimes not available for this purpose. Genomic predictions can thus support a more informed diversity management, especially when integrating simply to phenotype correlated traits to partly circumvent resource reallocations for a costly phenotyping of germplasm from other programs.<sep>Abstract Stripe or yellow rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici , is one of the most destructive wheat diseases. Sustainable management of wheat stripe rust can be achieved through the deployment of rust resistant cultivars. To detect effective resistance loci for use in breeding programs, an association mapping panel of 230 winter wheat cultivars and breeding lines from Northern and Central Europe was employed. Genotyping with the Illumina ® iSelect ® 25 K Infinium ® SNP genotyping array yielded 8,812 polymorphic markers. Structure analysis revealed two subpopulations with 92 Austrian breeding lines and cultivars separated from the other 138 genotypes. A genome-wide association study for adult plant stripe rust resistance identified 12 SNP markers on six wheat chromosomes which showed consistent effects over several testing environments. Among these, two marker loci on chromosomes 2BS ( RAC875_c1226_652 ) and 6AL ( Tdurum_contig29607_413 ) were found highly predictive in three independent validation populations of 1065, 1001, and 175 breeding lines. Lines showing the resistant haplotype at both loci were found nearly free of stipe rust symptoms. Using linear models with these markers as fixed effects, we could increase predictive ability in the three populations by 0.13–0.46 compared to a standard genomic best linear unbiased prediction approach. The obtained results facilitate an efficient selection for stripe rust resistance against the current pathogen population in the Northern and Central European winter wheat gene pool.<sep>Abstract The increasingly cost-efficient availability of ‘omics’ data has led to the development of a rich framework for predicting the performance of non-phenotyped selection candidates in recent years. The improvement of phenotypic analyses by using pedigree and/or genomic relationship data has however received much less attention, albeit it has shown large potential for increasing the efficiency of early generation yield trials in some breeding programs. The aim of this study was accordingly to assess the possibility to enhance phenotypic analyses of multi-location field trials with complete relationship information as well as when merely incomplete pedigree and/or genomic relationship information is available for a set of selection candidates. For his purpose, four winter bread wheat trial series conducted in Eastern and Western Europe were used to determine the experimental efficiency and accuracy of different resource allocations with a varying degree of relationship information. The results showed that modelling relationship between the selection candidates in the analyses of multi-location trial series was up to 20% more efficient than employing routine analyses, where genotypes are assumed to be unrelated. The observed decrease in efficiency and accuracy when reducing the testing capacities was furthermore less pronounced when modelling relationship information, even in cases when merely partial pedigree and/or genomic information was available for the phenotypic analyses. Exploiting complete and incomplete relationship information in both preliminary yield trials and multi-location trial series has thus large potential to optimize resource allocations and increase the selection gain in programs that make use of various predictive breeding methods.<sep>Winter hardiness is a major constraint for autumn sown crops in temperate regions, and thus an important breeding goal in the development of new winter wheat varieties. Winter hardiness is though influenced by many environmental factors rendering phenotypic selection under field conditions a difficult task due to irregular occurrence or absence of winter damage in field trials. Controlled frost tolerance tests in growth chamber experiments are, on the other hand, even with few genotypes, often costly and laborious, which makes a genomic breeding strategy for early generation selection an attractive alternative. The aims of this study were thus to compare the merit of marker-assisted selection using the major frost tolerance QTL Fr-A2 with genomic prediction for winter hardiness and frost tolerance, and to assess the potential of combining both measures with a genomic selection index using a high density marker map or a reduced set of pre-selected markers. Cross-validation within two training populations phenotyped for frost tolerance and winter hardiness underpinned the importance of Fr-A2 for frost tolerance especially when upweighting its effect in genomic prediction models, while a combined genomic selection index increased the prediction accuracy for an independent validation population in comparison to training with winter hardiness data alone. The prediction accuracy could moreover be maintained with pre-selected marker sets, which is highly relevant when employing cost reducing fingerprinting techniques such as targeted genotyping-by-sequencing. Genomic selection showed thus large potential to improve or maintain the performance of winter wheat for these difficult, costly, and laborious to phenotype traits.<sep>Large genetic improvement can be achieved by simultaneous genomic selection for grain yield and protein content when combining different breeding strategies in the form of selection indices. Genomic selection has been implemented in many national and international breeding programmes in recent years. Numerous studies have shown the potential of this new breeding tool; few have, however, taken the simultaneous selection for multiple traits into account that is though common practice in breeding programmes. The simultaneous improvement in grain yield and protein content is thereby a major challenge in wheat breeding due to a severe negative trade-off. Accordingly, the potential and limits of multi-trait selection for this particular trait complex utilizing the vast phenotypic and genomic data collected in an applied wheat breeding programme were investigated in this study. Two breeding strategies based on various genomic-selection indices were compared, which (1) aimed to select high-protein genotypes with acceptable yield potential and (2) develop high-yielding varieties, while maintaining protein content. The prediction accuracy of preliminary yield trials could be strongly improved when combining phenotypic and genomic information in a genomics-assisted selection approach, which surpassed both genomics-based and classical phenotypic selection methods both for single trait predictions and in genomic index selection across years. The employed genomic selection indices mitigated furthermore the negative trade-off between grain yield and protein content leading to a substantial selection response for protein yield, i.e. total seed nitrogen content, which suggested that it is feasible to develop varieties that combine a superior yield potential with comparably high protein content, thus utilizing available nitrogen resources more efficiently.<sep>We found two loci on chromosomes 2BS and 6AL that significantly contribute to stripe rust resistance in current European winter wheat germplasm. Stripe or yellow rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive wheat diseases. Sustainable management of wheat stripe rust can be achieved through the deployment of rust resistant cultivars. To detect effective resistance loci for use in breeding programs, an association mapping panel of 230 winter wheat cultivars and breeding lines from Northern and Central Europe was employed. Genotyping with the Illumina® iSelect® 25 K Infinium® single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array yielded 8812 polymorphic markers. Structure analysis revealed two subpopulations with 92 Austrian breeding lines and cultivars, which were separated from the other 138 genotypes from Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, and Switzerland. Genome-wide association study for adult plant stripe rust resistance identified 12 SNP markers on six wheat chromosomes which showed consistent effects over several testing environments. Among these, two marker loci on chromosomes 2BS (RAC875_c1226_652) and 6AL (Tdurum_contig29607_413) were highly predictive in three independent validation populations of 1065, 1001, and 175 breeding lines. Lines with the resistant haplotype at both loci were nearly free of stipe rust symptoms. By using mixed linear models with those markers as fixed effects, we could increase predictive ability in the three populations by 0.13-0.46 compared to a standard genomic best linear unbiased prediction approach. The obtained results facilitate an efficient selection for stripe rust resistance against the current pathogen population in the Northern and Central European winter wheat gene pool.<sep>Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), germination of seeds before harvest, is a major problem in global wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production, and leads to reduced bread-making quality in affected grain. Breeding for PHS resistance can prevent losses under adverse conditions. Selecting resistant lines in years lacking pre-harvest rain, requires challenging of plants in the field or in the laboratory or using genetic markers. Despite the availability of a wheat reference and pan-genome, linking markers, genes, allelic, and structural variation, a complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying various sources of PHS resistance is still lacking. Therefore, we challenged a population of European wheat varieties and breeding lines with PHS conditions and phenotyped them for PHS traits, grain quality, phenological and agronomic traits to conduct genome-wide association mapping. Furthermore, we compared these marker-trait associations to previously reported PHS loci and evaluated their usefulness for breeding. We found markers associated with PHS on all chromosomes, with strong evidence for novel quantitative trait locus/loci (QTL) on chromosome 1A and 5B. The QTL on chromosome 1A lacks pleiotropic effect, for the QTL on 5B we detected pleiotropic effects on phenology and grain quality. Multiple peaks on chromosome 4A co-located with the major resistance locus Phs-A1, for which two causal genes, TaPM19 and TaMKK3, have been proposed. Mapping markers and genes to the pan-genome and chromosomal alignments provide evidence for structural variation around this major PHS-resistance locus. Although PHS is controlled by many loci distributed across the wheat genome, Phs-A1 on chromosome 4A seems to be the most effective and widely deployed source of resistance, in European wheat varieties.<sep>NIRS of wheat grains as phenomic predictors for grain yield show inflated prediction ability and are biased toward grain protein content. Estimating the breeding value of individuals using genome-wide marker data (genomic prediction) is currently one of the most important drivers of breeding progress in major crops. Recently, phenomic technologies, including remote sensing and aerial hyperspectral imaging of plant canopies, have made it feasible to predict the breeding value of individuals in the absence of genetic marker data. This is commonly referred to as phenomic prediction. Hyperspectral measurements in the form of near-infrared spectroscopy have been used since the 1980 s to predict compositional parameters of harvest products. Moreover, in recent studies NIRS from grains was used to predict grain yield. The same studies showed that phenomic prediction can outperform genomic prediction for grain yield. The genome is static and not environment dependent, thereby limiting genomic prediction ability. Gene expression is tissue specific and differs under environmental influences, leading to a tissue- and environment-specific phenome, potentially explaining the higher predictive ability of phenomic prediction. Here, we compare genomic prediction and phenomic prediction from hyperspectral measurements of wheat grains for the prediction of a variety of traits including grain yield. We show that phenomic predictions outperform genomic prediction for some traits. However, phenomic predictions are biased toward the information present in the predictor. Future studies on this topic should investigate whether population parameters are retained in phenomic prediction as they are in genomic prediction. Furthermore, we find that unbiased phenomic prediction abilities are considerably lower than previously reported and recommend a method to circumvent this issue.<sep>A novel genomic selection strategy offers the unique opportunity to develop qualitative race-specific resistant varieties that possess high levels of the more durable quantitative race-nonspecific resistance in their genetic background. Race-specific qualitative resistance genes (R-genes) are conferring complete resistance in many pathosystems, but are frequently overcome by new virulent pathogen races. Once the deployed R-genes are overcome, a wide variation of quantitative disease resistance (QDR) can be observed in a set of previously race-specific, i.e., completely resistant genotypes-a phenomenon known as \"vertifolia effect.\" This race-nonspecific QDR is considered to be more durable in the long term, but provides merely a partial protection against pathogens. This simulation study aimed to detangle race-specific R-gene-mediated resistance of pending selection candidates and the QDR in their genetic background by employing different genomic selection strategies. True breeding values that reflected performance data for rust resistance in wheat were simulated, and used in a recurrent genomic selection based on several prediction models and training population designs. Using training populations that were devoid of race-specific R-genes was thereby pivotal for an efficient improvement of QDR in the long term. Marker-assisted preselection for the presence of R-genes followed by a genomic prediction for accumulating the many small to medium effect loci underlying QDR in the genetic background of race-specific resistant genotypes appeared furthermore to be a promising approach to select simultaneously for both types of resistance. The practical application of such a knowledge-driven genomic breeding strategy offers the opportunity to develop varieties with multiple layers of resistance, which have the potential to prevent intolerable crop losses under epidemic situations by displaying a high level of QDR even when race-specific R-genes have been overcome by evolving pathogen populations.<sep>Abstract Key message Genomic relationship matrices based on mid-parent and family bulk genotypes represent cost-efficient alternatives to full genomic prediction approaches with individually genotyped early generation selection candidates. Abstract The routine usage of genomic selection for improving line varieties has gained an increasing popularity in recent years. Harnessing the benefits of this approach can, however, be too costly for many small-scale breeding programs, as in most genomic breeding strategies several hundred or even thousands of lines have to be genotyped each year. The aim of this study was thus to compare a full genomic prediction strategy using individually genotyped selection candidates with genomic predictions based on genotypes obtained from pooled DNA of progeny families as well as genotypes inferred from crossing parents. A population of 722 wheat lines representing 63 families tested in more than 100 multi-environment trials during 2010–2019 was for this purpose employed to conduct an empirical study, which was supplemented by a simulation with genotypic data from further 3855 lines. A similar or higher prediction ability was achieved for grain yield, protein yield, and the protein content when using mid-parent or family bulk genotypes in comparison with pedigree selection in the empirical across family prediction scenario. The difference of these methods with a full genomic prediction strategy became furthermore marginal if pre-existing phenotypic data of the selection candidates was already available. Similar observations were made in the simulation, where the usage of individually genotyped lines or family bulks was generally preferable with smaller family sizes. The proposed methods can thus be regarded as alternatives to full genomic or pedigree selection strategies, especially when pedigree information is limited like in the exchange of germplasm between breeding programs.<sep>Simultaneous genomic selection for grain yield, protein content and dough rheological traits enables the development of resource-use efficient varieties that combine superior yield potential with comparably high end-use quality. Selecting simultaneously for grain yield and baking quality is a major challenge in wheat breeding, and several concepts like grain protein deviations have been developed for shifting the undesirable negative correlation between both traits. The protein quality is, however, not considered in these concepts, although it is an important aspect and might facilitate the selection of genotypes that use available resources more efficiently with respect to the quantity and quality of the final end products. A population of 480 lines from an applied wheat breeding programme that was phenotyped for grain yield, protein content, protein yield and dough rheological traits was thus used to assess the potential of using integrated genomic selection indices to ease selection decisions with regard to the plethora of quality traits. Additionally, the feasibility of achieving a simultaneous genetic improvement in grain yield, protein content and protein quality was investigated to develop more resource-use efficient varieties. Dough rheological traits related to either gluten strength or viscosity were combined in two separate indices, both of which showed a substantially smaller negative trade-off with grain yield than the protein content. Genomic selection indices based on regression deviations for the two latter traits were subsequently extended by the gluten strength or viscosity indices. They revealed a large merit for identifying resource-use efficient genotypes that combine both superior yield potential with comparably high end-use quality. Hence, genomic selection opens up the opportunity for multi-trait selection in early generations, which will most likely increase the efficiency when developing new and improved varieties.</abstract>", "<keyword>Germplasm<sep>Follicle<sep>Metabolomics<sep>Zygote<sep>Legume<sep>Chemically defined medium<sep>Toolbox<sep>Stroke (engine)<sep>Field (mathematics)<sep>Sugar<sep>Mass spectrometry<sep>Glycosphingolipid<sep>Soft tissue<sep>Cultivar<sep>Best linear unbiased prediction<sep>Ethyl carbamate<sep>Spectral line<sep>Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry<sep>Food products<sep>Standardization<sep>Function (biology)<sep>Vancomycin<sep>Embryo<sep>Distillers grains<sep>Mitochondrial DNA<sep>Collision-induced dissociation<sep>Sarcomere<sep>Synechocystis<sep>Proportional hazards model<sep>Ethanol<sep>Chemometrics<sep>Cannabidiol<sep>Visualization<sep>Mass spectrum<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Gibberellin<sep>Oocyte<sep>Dissolved organic carbon<sep>Fragmentation (computing)<sep>Meal<sep>Ion<sep>Anthesis<sep>Annotation<sep>Sugar beet<sep>Diabetes mellitus<sep>Hyperspectral imaging<sep>Follicular phase<sep>Plant defense against herbivory<sep>Avena<sep>Heart failure<sep>Phaseolus<sep>Cancer<sep>Produced water<sep>Ion suppression in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry<sep>Sphingomyelin<sep>Trait<sep>Staphylococcus aureus<sep>Plant virus<sep>Fermentation<sep>Flucloxacillin<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Sawfly<sep>Cefuroxime<sep>Graph<sep>Data processing<sep>Hydrophilic interaction chromatography<sep>Type 2 diabetes<sep>Nutrient<sep>SWEAT<sep>Body mass index<sep>Prospective cohort study<sep>Data quality<sep>Sample (material)<sep>Lactobacillus<sep>Cefepime<sep>Sample size determination<sep>Quality assurance<sep>Genomics<sep>Scripting language<sep>Hazard ratio<sep>White adipose tissue<sep>Blood pressure<sep>Biomarker<sep>Bioavailability<sep>Glacier<sep>Atrial fibrillation<sep>Workflow<sep>Surrogate endpoint<sep>Rhizosphere<sep>Single-nucleotide polymorphism<sep>Detection limit<sep>Metabolism<sep>Identification (biology)<sep>Prostate cancer<sep>Gas chromatography<sep>Germinal vesicle<sep>Organic matter<sep>Embryo culture<sep>Construct (python library)<sep>Adaptation (eye)<sep>Metabolite profiling<sep>Sorghum<sep>Cyanobacteria<sep>Genome<sep>Therapeutic drug monitoring<sep>Population<sep>Follicular fluid<sep>Ion-mobility spectrometry<sep>Longissimus<sep>Leverage (statistics)<sep>Virus<sep>Abiotic component<sep>Omics<sep>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry<sep>Plant breeding<sep>Lipidomics<sep>Abscisic acid<sep>Proteome<sep>Glycoalkaloid<sep>Auxin<sep>Water quality<sep>Instrumentation (computer programming)<sep>Urine<sep>Akkermansia<sep>Antibiotics<sep>Reverse osmosis<sep>Profiling (computer programming)<sep>Cheminformatics<sep>Metabolome<sep>Cannabinoid<sep>Vigna<sep>Metabolite<sep>Drought stress<sep>Probabilistic logic<sep>Exudate<sep>Rock glacier<sep>Nanofiltration<sep>Composition (language)<sep>Cajanus<sep>Glacial period<sep>Estrous cycle<sep>Jasmonic acid<sep>Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry<sep>Sphingolipid<sep>Ecosystem<sep>Aphid<sep>CATS<sep>Reuse<sep>Bioconductor<sep>Blastocyst<sep>Tenderness<sep>Analyte<sep>Loin<sep>Obesity</keyword><title>Data Processing for GC-MS- and LC-MS-Based Untargeted Metabolomics<sep>Mining the NIST Mass Spectral Library Reveals the Extent of Sodium Assisted Inductive Cleavage in Collision-Induced Fragmentation<sep>Metabolic disturbances in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) during infection with Beet necrotic yellow vein virus<sep>Recent advances in mass spectrometry-based computational metabolomics<sep>Application of Predicted Collisional Cross Section to Metabolome Databases to Probabilistically Describe the Current and Future Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry<sep>Quantitative Analysis of Ethyl Carbamate in Distillers Grains Co-products and Bovine Plasma by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry<sep>Non-targeted metabolomics of cooked cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) from Ghana using two distinct and complementary analytical platforms<sep>Multielement Profiling of Diverse Food Samples<sep>Quantitative Analysis of Ethyl Carbamate in Distillers Grains Co-products and Bovine Plasma by GC-MS<sep>Non-targeted urine metabolomics and associations with prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes<sep>White Kidney Bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris L.)

The emerging ‘Data-to-Deal’ approach is a collaborative effort by 60 specialists, which aims to address this by providing a flexible framework of options, tailored to individual country circumstances, aiming to enhance core functions and capabilities; it serves as a basis for concrete action, informing capacity building, technical assistance, and research. This paper argues for the mainstreaming of a holistic approach to accessing climate finance by outlining the components of the Data-to- Deal pipeline and showing the effectiveness of Data-to-Deal through the demonstration of its successful implementation in Costa Rica.<sep>Motivated by foreseeable changes in the Earth's systems, governments across the world learn to anticipate the consequences. Understanding how such anticipation comes about should ease its further development. We therefore explore the central capacity within anticipatory governance: the capacity to infer future consequences. Such inferential capacity consists of tools, techniques, and practices increasing an agent's options to infer consequences. We examine the development of this capacity for two Southeast Asian deltas, using data from a multi-sited ethnography and a social network analysis. These methods combine the small-scale ‘lived’ perspective of agents and the multiscale network in which these agents deploy strategies to entrench tools, techniques, and practices for inferential capacity. Strategic choices in positioning for network effects and fostering reciprocity matter, while values and historical contingencies cannot be brushed aside.<sep>Although public sector organizations (municipalities, regulatory agencies, publicly controlled utilities, etc.), are pivotal in green sustainability transitions, a conceptualization of their transformative capacity is underdeveloped. Several strands of literature pay attention to the concept of ‘capacity’, but these remain disjointed. Conducting a literature review, the present paper identifies variations and understudied aspects of the concept. It proposes a holistic conceptual framework based on three elements: organizational roles, resources, and (cap)abilities. The transformative capacity of a public sector organization is defined by the interaction between the organization’s purposeful enactment of various roles when exercising path-breaking change agency, and its deployment and development of dynamic (cap)abilities when mobilizing the internal and external resources at its disposal. This framework offers a granular analytical approach for future empirical studies of highly diverse public sector organizations and sustainability transitions, with the potential to offer practical clues for more targeted transformative capacity-building efforts.<sep>The climate crisis requires developing countries to urgently decarbonize energy systems and mobilize finance while balancing competing priorities such as economic growth, energy security, environmental sustainability, and social development. However, many developing countries face challenges in developing long-term energy planning strategies, including limited capacity and reliance on external consultants. To address these issues, 21 international organizations and research institutions have developed five strategic principles for energy planning: national ownership, coherence and inclusivity, human capacity development, analysis robustness, and transparency and accessibility of data and tools. This paper discusses joint efforts to promote and apply these principles using science-based evidence and analytical modelling tools, such as the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) and the power system IRENA FlexTool. These tools are part of a suite of emerging modelling tools to support climate-compatible development policies and have been included in accessible teaching material, online courses, summer schools, and capacity development programs.<sep>Innovations and efficiencies in digital technology have lately been depicted as paramount in the green transition to enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, both in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector and the wider economy. This, however, fails to adequately account for rebound effects that can offset emission savings and, in the worst case, increase emissions. In this perspective, we draw on a transdisciplinary workshop with 19 experts from carbon accounting, digital sustainability research, ethics, sociology, public policy, and sustainable business to expose the challenges of addressing rebound effects in digital innovation processes and associated policy. We utilize a responsible innovation approach to uncover potential ways forward for incorporating rebound effects in these domains, concluding that addressing ICT-related rebound effects ultimately requires a shift from an ICT efficiency-centered perspective to a “systems thinking” model, which aims to understand efficiency as one solution among others that requires constraints on emissions for ICT environmental savings to be realized.<sep>Aligning development and climate goals means Africa’s energy systems will be based on clean energy technologies in the long term, but pathways to get there are uncertain and variable across countries. Although current debates about natural gas and renewables in Africa are heated, they largely ignore the substantial context specificity of the starting points, development objectives and uncertainties of each African country’s energy system trajectory. Here we—an interdisciplinary and majority African group of authors—highlight that each country faces a distinct solution space and set of uncertainties for using renewables or fossil fuels to meet its development objectives. For example, Ethiopia is headed for an accelerated green-growth pathway, but Mozambique is at a crossroads of natural gas expansion with implicit large-scale technological, economic, financial and social risks and uncertainties. We provide geopolitical, policy, finance and research recommendations to create firm country-specific evidence to identify adequate energy system pathways for development and to enable their implementation. Discussions abound regarding the future of African energy systems, yet they typically overlook the different starting points and development objectives of each country. This Perspective highlights these differences and calls for more context-specific attention to define low-carbon energy pathways.<sep>Artificial Intelligence and associated digital technologies (DTs) have environmental impacts. These include heavy carbon dioxide emissions linked to the energy consumption required to generate and process large amounts of data; extracting minerals for, and manufacturing of, technological components; and e-waste. These environmental impacts are receiving increasing policy and media attention through discourses of environmental sustainability. At the same time, ‘sustainability’ is a complex and nebulous term with a multiplicity of meanings and practices. This paper explores how experts working with DTs understand and utilise the concept of environmental sustainability in their practices. Our research question was how do stakeholders researching, governing or working on the environmental impacts of DTs, utilise environmental sustainability concepts? We applied a combination of bibliometric analysis and 24 interviews with key stakeholders from the digital technology sector. Findings show that, although stakeholders have broad conceptual understandings of the term sustainability and its relation to the environmental impacts of DTs, in practice, environmental sustainability tends to be associated with technology based and carboncentric approaches. While narrowing conceptual understandings of environmental sustainability was viewed to have a practical purpose, it hid broader sustainability concerns. We urge those in the field not to lose sight of the wider ‘ethos of sustainability’.<sep>Building capacity for governments to make inferences about future developments enhances their ability to anticipate and plan for climate change adaptation. This study examines the question: how do networked organisations build capacity for anticipatory governance through project-based interactions? We analyse a global network of organisations that mobilise climate and hydrological modelling technologies into the Chao Phraya and Ayeyarwaddy deltas. The methodology innovatively combines ethnographic data with policy analysis and social network analysis. Findings suggest that organisations consolidate technology and knowledge transfer through a global network. However, their governance effect in enhancing anticipatory decision making is found to be marginal at the local level. We argue that anticipatory governance practices need a balancing of foresight tools and techniques with local institutional arrangements in order to be effective. We further demonstrate that technology transfer projects need to be backed up with social and strategic capacity building in order to nurture consistent anticipatory governance in different cultural contexts. We conclude that preventive actions, together with transparent operational response frameworks, could significantly improve resilience and adaptability of local knowledge systems and institutions dealing with climate change adaptation. Such integration could enable anticipatory response measures to better manage risk, as well as increase institutional cooperation for long term environmental planning.<sep>Climate change adds pressure to the international community to work cooperatively, find ways to govern technologies and expert knowledge, develop better policies, and mobilise resources, tools, and practices to deal with potential consequences and impacts. The institutional drivers underpinning current knowledge applications in globally connected spaces of sustainable development practice are increasingly complex, intertwined, and empirically understudied. In this context, this PhD thesis aims to advance our empirical understanding of why and how formal cooperation networks form, negotiate, mobilise and utilise particular technologies and expert knowledge and attempt to steer visions and pathways for change. This research combines multi-sited ethnography with social network analysis and policy analysis and investigates formal contexts of global connection. This thesis examines practices of science and technology policy through technology-driven networks in multiple locations in Europe and Southeast Asia. In particular, this thesis analyses the processes and conditions through which tools (e.g. modelling technologies), practices (e.g. climate negotiations, technology transfer activities, risk management, and environmental planning), and ways of dealing with climate-related uncertainties are implemented in a global knowledge network articulated under the UN system. The participant observation that is applied in the research is grounded in mobile contexts of project-based interactions, intergovernmental negotiations, international expert meetings, high-level advisory boards, technology assessments, implementation of technology transfer programmes, capacity-building workshops, expert discussions on anticipation and uncertainty, and the production of reports, climate policies, and procurement systems. This thesis examines how the artefacts of transfer interact in the implementation of the Technology Mechanism under the UNFCCC, drawing on cases of climate and hydrological modelling ranging from the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) to Thailand and Myanmar. It maps and analyses the global response of networked organisations, with special attention to persistent North South power dynamics imposed by global environmental governance regimes and their emergent ‘transformational claims’. This thesis delves into a critical evaluation of transformational change narratives in institutionalised knowledge systems, practices of technology transfer, and science policy spaces inside the United Nations. It contributes to a better foundational understanding of knowledge governance relating to critical social and environmental challenges, and rethinks futures of collective climate action in light of sustainability transformations theory and practice.<sep>This paper presents an innovative approach to addressing critical global challenges in long-term energy planning for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The paper proposes and tests an international enabling environment, a delivery ecosystem, and a community of practice. These components are integrated into workflows that yield four self-sustaining capacity-development outcomes. Planning long-term energy strategies in LMICs is particularly challenging due to limited national agency and poor international coordination. While outsourcing energy planning to foreign experts may appear to be a viable solution, it can lead to a reduction in government agency (the ability of a government to make its own informed analysis and decisions). Additionally, studies commissioned by external experts may have conflicting terms of reference, and a lack of familiarity with local conditions can result in misrepresentations of on-the-ground realities. It is argued here that enhancing national agency and analytical capacity can improve coordination and lead to more robust planning across line ministries and technical assistance (TA) providers. Moreover, the prevailing consulting model hampers the release and accessibility of underlying analytics, making it difficult to retrieve, reuse, and reconstruct consultant outputs. The absence of interoperability among outputs from various consultants hinders the ability to combine and audit the insights they provide. To overcome these challenges, five strategic principles for energy planning in LMICs have been introduced and developed in collaboration with 21 international and research organizations, including the AfDB, IEA, IRENA, IAEA, UNDP, UNECA, the World Bank, and WRI. These principles prioritize national ownership, coherence and inclusivity, capacity, robustness, transparency and accessibility. In this enabling environment, a unique delivery ecosystem consisting of knowledge products and activities is established. The paper focuses on two key knowledge products as examples of this ecosystem: the open-source energy modeling system (OSeMOSYS) and the power system flexibility tool (IRENA FlexTool). These ecosystem elements are designed to meet user-friendliness, retrievability, reusability, reconstructability, repeatability, interoperability, and audibility (U4RIA) goals. To ensure the sustainability of this ecosystem, OpTIMUS is introduced—a community of practice dedicated to maintaining, supporting, expanding, and nurturing the elements within the ecosystem. Among other ecosystem elements, training and research initiatives are introduced, namely the Energy Modelling Platform for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia-Pacific as well as the ICTP Joint Summer School on Modelling Tools for Sustainable Development. Once deployed via workflows, the preliminary outcomes of these capacity-development learning pathways show promise. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate their long-term impacts, scalability, replication, and deployment costs.</abstract>", "<keyword>Positron<sep>Linear actuator<sep>Gesture

The design of the proposed monolithic soft gripper includes a middle bellow and two side bellows (i.e., fingers). The positions of the fingers are regulated by adjusting the negative pressure in the middle bellow actuator via an on-off controller. The stiffness of the soft gripper is modulated by controlling the positive pressure in the fingers through the use of a proportional air-pressure regulator. It is experimentally shown that the proposed soft gripper can modulate its stiffness by 125% within 250ms. It is also shown that the variable stiffness soft gripper can help improve the safety and performance of grasping tasks in<sep>Hand gesture, one of the essential ways for a human to convey information and express intuitive intention, has a significant degree of differentiation, substantial flexibility, and high robustness of information transmission to make hand gesture recognition (HGR) one of the research hotspots in the fields of human–human and human–computer or human–machine interactions. Noninvasive, on‐body sensors can monitor, track, and recognize hand gestures for various applications such as sign language recognition, rehabilitation, myoelectric control for prosthetic hands and human–machine interface (HMI), and many other applications. This article systematically reviews recent achievements from noninvasive upper‐limb sensing techniques for HGR, multimodal sensing fusion to gain additional user information, and wearable gesture recognition algorithms to obtain more reliable and robust performance. Research<sep>Older adults walk with a shorter stride length, reduced hip range of motion (ROM) and higher cadence. These are signs of reductions in walking ability. This study investigated whether using a wireless smart insole system that monitored and provided biofeedback to encourage an extension of swing time could increase stride length and hip flexion, while reducing the cadence. Seven older adults were tested in this study, with and without the biofeedback device, in an outdoor environment. Gait analysis was performed by using GaitRite system and Xsens MVN. Repeated measures analysis demonstrated that with biofeedback, the swing time increased by 6.45%, stride length by 4.52% and hip flexion by 14.73%, with statistical significance. It also decreased the cadence significantly<sep>In this paper, a model-free control framework is proposed to control the tip force of a cantilevered trilayer CPA and similar cantilevered smart actuators. The proposed control method eliminates the requirement of modeling the CPAs in controller design for each application, and it is based on the online local estimation of the actuator dynamics. Due to the fact that the controller has few parameters to tune, this control method provides a relatively easy design and implementation process for the CPAs as compared to other model-free controllers. Although it is not vital, in order to optimize the controller performance, a meta-heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which utilizes an initial baseline model that approximates the CPAs dynamics, is used.<sep>Enabling the robotic ability to sense tactile interactions is a complex and interdisciplinary challenge, as traditional pressure sensors made of hard and rigid materials struggle to replicate the soft and compliant interactions of mammalian somatosensory networks. This study investigates a novel matrixed contact sensor designed for use in soft robotics and biomedical prosthesis applications. The sensor is a coupled piezocapacitive-piezoresistive tactile sensor, optimized for scalability over various mechanical stimuli, including touch, pressure, bend, stretch, and proximity. By modifying the bulk geometry to include dielectric artifacts and integrating electroactive elastomeric composites, the soft and flexible sensor is fully mechanically compliant and conforms to skin behavior. The sensor has a maximum sensitivity of 0.028kPa <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup> , a resolution<sep>This paper explores the design process of robotics and autonomous systems using a co-design approach, applied ethics, and values-driven methods. Specifically, the approach seeks to move beyond traditional risk assessment toward a greater consideration of end-user exposure. The goal of the ethics-based co-design approach is to identify end-user and stakeholder values that guide the minimization of end-user vulnerability associated with the employment of autonomous systems. This design process is also used to identify positive consequences that probably increase human well-being as opposed to simply avoiding harm. We argue that biomedical autonomous systems design, during the preclinical phase, should bring together diverse stakeholders that would not traditionally be involved in design. We also argue that embedding ethical considerations in<sep>Abstract Soft pneumatic actuators are ideal for soft robotic applications due to their innate compliance and high power‐weight ratios, but their design is limited by the lack of suitable stretchable materials. In this study, a new highly elastic resin for digital light projection 3D printers, designated ElastAMBER, is prepared from a di‐functional polyether urethane acrylate oligomer, and a blend of two different diluent monomers. ElastAMBER exhibits a viscosity of 1000 mPa s at 40°C, outperforming previously synthesized elastic resins and allowing easy printing at near room temperatures. The 3D‐printed components present an elastomeric behavior with a maximum extension ratio ( λ ) of 4.02 ± 0.06, ultimate tensile strength of 1.23 ± 0.09 MPa, low hysteresis, and negligible<sep>Ultra-stretchable sensors are highly desirable for wearable electronic applications. In this paper, we manufactured self-standing piezoresistive sensors using a simple method based on blending multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a stretchable elastomeric matrix (Ecoflex). The sensors showed a low electrical percolation threshold of 0.3 wt%, with an elastic modulus as soft as the human skin in the forearm and palm dermis. An increase in the cross-linking degree of the matrix from 17.43 ± 0.20 mol/m3 up to 28.55 ± 2.07 mol/m3 was observed with the incorporation of MWCNTs, revealing that the conductive filler is covalently bonded to the elastomeric matrix. The piezoresistive sensors showed high stretchability with an outstanding linearity between the resistance change with the applied strain,<sep>In this study, a novel magnetically actuated robotic capsule (patent-filed, Alici and Zhou, 2019) is proposed for site-specific drug delivery inside the gastrointestinal tract. Retractable needles are equipped into the capsule-like robot to inject the drug directly into intended tissues, which will contribute to the full and fast absorption of the medication and consequently increase the efficacy of drug delivery. The needle is concealed inside the capsule initially and can be actively protruded and retracted by a magnetic membrane. A second magnetic membrane is employed to discharge the drug out of the reservoir and inject it into the targeted tissue through the needle. Besides active drug releasing, the robotic capsule is able to perform active locomotion controlled by<sep>The modeling of soft structures, actuators, and sensors is challenging, primarily due to the high nonlinearities involved in such soft robotic systems. Finite element modeling (FEM) is an effective technique to represent soft and deformable robotic systems containing geometric nonlinearities due to large mechanical deformations, material nonlinearities due to the inherent nonlinear behavior of the materials (i.e., stress-strain behavior) involved in such systems, and contact nonlinearities due to the surfaces that come into contact upon deformation. Prior to the fabrication of such soft robotic systems, FEM can be used to predict their behavior efficiently and accurately under various inputs and optimize their performance and topology to meet certain design and performance requirements. In this article, we present the<sep>Equipping prosthetic devices with sensory feedback capability is a continuing research challenge to increase their control and embodiment, and to decrease their rejection by their users. Electrotactile stimulation is one of the non-invasive sensory feedback techniques with a low power, light-weight and relatively easy to control stimulation mechanism to provide the feedback. Currently, there are two electrode setups used in the literature, concentric electrodes and separated electrodes, to apply the electrotactile stimulation to deliver tactile feedback. There is minimal data available in the literature to compare the two electrode setups. This study compares the impact of the electrode arrangements on the dynamic range, just noticeable difference (JND), comfort level, degree of localisation, intensity and type of sensation induced,<sep>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) are useful within a variety of situations where it is not efficient or wise for a manned aerial vehicle to be used. One problem facing the use of UAV’s within a wide variety of circumstances is the need for an efficient gripper. In this paper, we explore current gripping designs as well as the biological design of an eagle’s claw to develop an efficient gripping system capable of being used with UAV’s. The 3D design and development of a tendon locking mechanism has been iterated and tested to display an efficient, constant lock. A gripper was developed and integrated with the locking mechanism that validates the locking mechanism’s capability.

Different combinations of the sensors are investigated. As sEMG is dominant in the applications of externally powered prosthetic hands, it is involved in most hybrid sensor combinations. The combined use of sEMG and IMU is most studied in the literature as IMU is easy to be integrated. Though limited, the investigation on other hybrid modalities has been drawing more and more research attention and efforts, especially those with FMG and NIRS. For all the reported hybrid sensors, it is verified that this strategy can enrich the information of user intention and help the pattern recognition and/or<sep>This present review includes a systematic search for peer-reviewed articles published between March 2009 and March 2020 that evaluated the effects of wearable devices with biofeedback on the biomechanics of running. The included articles did not focus on physiological and metabolic metrics. Articles with patients, animals, orthoses, exoskeletons and virtual reality were not included. Following the PRISMA guidelines, 417 articles were first identified, and nineteen were selected following the removal of duplicates and articles which did not meet the inclusion criteria. Most reviewed articles reported a significant reduction in positive peak acceleration, which was found to be related to tibial stress fractures in running. Some previous studies provided biofeedback aiming to increase stride frequencies. They produced some positive<sep>Using positron emission markers for the localization of a robotic capsule endoscope is promising because it does not require onboard space or built-in battery for operation. Further, its compatibility with magnetic actuation is another significant advantage compared with conventional magnetic localization methods reported in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new tracking algorithm based on rigid-body transformation and gamma rays emitted from three positron emission markers onboard to localize an endoscopic capsule operating within the gastrointestinal tract of the human body. Different from traditional rigid-body transformation based on datasets of 3-D points, our method estimates the transformation parameters (e.g., translation vector and rotation angle) from several groups of 3-D lines in order to determine the locations<sep>Numerous soft grippers have been developed based on smart materials, pneumatic soft actuators, and underactuated compliant structures. In this article, we present a three-dimensional (3-D) printed omni-purpose soft gripper (OPSOG) that can grasp a wide variety of objects with different weights, sizes, shapes, textures, and stiffnesses. The soft gripper has a unique design that incorporates soft fingers and a suction cup that operate either separately or simultaneously to grasp specific objects. A bundle of 3-D-printable linear soft vacuum actuators (LSOVA) that generate a linear stroke upon activation is employed to drive the tendon-driven soft fingers. The support, fingers, suction cup, and actuation unit of the gripper were printed using a low-cost and open-source fused deposition modeling 3-D printer.<sep>Sensory feedback is a highly researched area for upper limb prosthetics, for which the stimulation is applied to either the upper arm or lower arm with minimal justification for the chosen site. In this study, we compare the recognition of three stimulation sites and their sensitivities to the stimulation applied to the upper and lower arm sites from a mechanotactile stimulation device. Our stimulation device is a crank-based mechanotactile feedback system, which applies a combination of a pressure applied in the normal direction and tangential direction to the skin at the stimulation sites on the lower arm and upper arm. The recognition rate for six grip patterns was found to be not statistically different between the upper and<sep>The thumb of a natural hand or a prosthetic hand plays a significant role in realizing a hand's grasping and manipulation activities. This requires that mechanical design of a prosthetic hand should allow its thumb to perform both abduction/adduction and flexion/extension in order to mimic a natural hand's grasping and manipulation abilities with a minimum number of actuators. In this letter, we propose a novel monolithic soft robotic thumb for an anthropomorphic and transradial prosthetic hand. The thumb and the whole prosthetic hand were fabricated using a low-cost three-dimensional printing technology, with sizes comparable to those of real human ones but with much lighter weights.

The fingers of the soft gripper were 3D printed simultaneously along with the pTSC, without requiring support materials, using an inexpensive fused deposition modeling 3D printer. The pTSCs embedded in the fingers have numerous advantages, including fast response, repeatability, reliability, negligible hysteresis, stability over time, durability, and very low power consumption.

The monolithic finger was fabricated using a low-cost and open-source fused deposition modeling 3-D printer that employs an off-the-shelf soft and flexible commercially available thermoplastic polyurethane. A single soft hinge with an embedded PSC was optimized using finite element modeling and a hyperelastic material model to obtain a linear relationship between the internal change in the volume of its PSC and the corresponding input mechanical modality, to minimize its bending stiffness and to maximize its internal volume. The soft hinges with embedded PSCs have several advantages, such as fast response to very small changes in<sep>Soft pneumatic actuators can produce a range of motions and deliver a high force-to-mass ratio whilst offering intrinsic compliance. Presently, the majority of soft pneumatic actuators are used to create bending motions, with very few able to produce significant linear movements.

However, existing soft prosthetic hands design were often not geared towards addressing some of the practical requirements highlighted in prosthetics research. The gap between the existing designs and the practical requirements significantly hampers the potential to transfer these designs to real-world applications. This work addressed these requirements with the consideration of the trade-off between practicality and performance.

The VBR employs a single-end Dickson type charge-pump topology, and the circuit would be realized as a monolithic chip. The evaluation results obtained by multi-physics simulations on a circuit simulator reveal that the proposed circuit can deliver boosted DC voltage from the input of sub-threshold AC voltage.<sep>We report an energy harvesting technique that generates electrical power from non -stational environmental vibrations. To utilize weak vibrations that are wasted by conventional rectifiers, we employ a voltage-boost rectifier (VBR) circuit. The VBR can convert small AC voltage from vibrational energy harvesters (VEHs) to a DC output voltage for driving a latter circuity, as reported in PowerMEMS 2018. A VBR chip is implemented by the complementary metal -oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and experimentally evaluated with an electret-based MEMS VEH. The measurement results reveal that the proposed technique can generate effective DC voltage from weak non-stational vibrations.<sep>This paper presents an energy harvesting technique that generates effective DC power from non-stationary weak environmental vibrations. We employ a voltage-boost rectifier (VBR) circuit utilizing small output from a vibrational energy harvester under non-stationary vibrations, which cannot be utilized by conventional rectifiers. A VBR circuit is fabricated by the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and packaged as a chip. The VBR chip is combined with an electret-based MEMS vibrational energy harvester and experimentally evaluated under non-stationary vibration. Measurement results show that the proposed system can deliver an effective DC voltage over 5.6 V from non-stationary vibrations (0.3 m/s2RMS) while a conventional diode rectifier delivered 0.3 V or lower.<sep>A real-time dynamic Brillouin optical time domain reflectometry (BOTDR)-based system is introduced by using small gain stimulated Brillouin scattering with fast data managing and saving method. The system achieves 2-cm read-out interval, 2-m spatial resolution, and about 7-με accuracy with about 7 Hz or even faster with 23 Hz continuous monitoring. A movement response on a polymer mat made pavement was successfully monitored by the proposed system. For example, the pace distance at each walking step was detected to be 0.62 m. In addition, the minimum strain difference measured after several human loads is about 10 με with 7-με uncertainty and 3-με repeatability, indicating the possibility of real-time strain monitoring and the movement or trajectory detection by distributed fiber optic strain sensing.<sep>Live load-induced deformation is a significant evaluation index for bridge maintenance. To measure a structural displacement response, a method using several MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) accelerometers has previously been developed. However, this method requires several sensors, and for improved practicality, a reduction in the number of sensors is desired. Therefore, in this article, a simple displacement monitoring method is proposed that uses only one MEMS accelerometer, which is installed at the longitudinal center of the target bridge. A wavelet transform-based method is applied to the acceleration records to identify the integration range for displacement estimation. The accuracy was evaluated on an actual in-service bridge. The result indicates high accuracy of displacement measurements, with only 5% error when compared with the values recorded by a contact displacement gauge.<sep>About 95% of all fatigue damage to plate girder bridges occurs at the front of soleplates, the edge of gusset plates, and the upper end of vertical stiffeners. In the present study, the changes in vibration frequency and main-girder deflection that are generally used as indices to monitor the condition of a bridge were analytically investigated to determine their effectiveness, using a model that considered the influence of the types of fatigue cracks present in a real bridge. The results of a natural vibration analysis and a dynamic analysis that considered a vehicle traveling on the bridge showed that the dynamic deflection response and the vibration characteristics of the bridge changed as damage progressed. It was found to be possible to identify the conditions leading up to serious fracture of the main member and total bridge collapse. However, it was more difficult to detect incipient fatigue cracks and fracture of secondary members.<sep>For effective maintenance of infrastructure such as bridges and shield tunnels, in addition to visual inspection, it is important to measure responses to external loads such as strain and displacement, which allows engineers to evaluate the condition of such structures. Furthermore, in order to implement appropriate repair and reinforcement procedures for unanticipated displacement induced damage, it is essential to determine the deformation caused by external loads that lead to high strain. In this study, in order to determine the dynamic deformations of a shield tunnel under the load of a passing train, field measurements were first conducted using eight microelectromechanical systems accelerometers. A method was proposed to determine the displacement response from measured acceleration data that include the vibration rectification error. Finally, the deformations of the shield tunnel due to train load were visualized based on the displacement responses. The results allowed the deformations of the shield tunnel during train passage to be perceived visually.<sep>Many researchers have developed bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM) technology, mainly focusing on the representative value of the estimated axle weights. However, the estimation of the probabilistic distribution of axle weights is also important for understanding the ill conditioning of BWIM formulations and the uncertainty of estimation. Bayesian updating provides a coherent framework for assimilating data into models. Here, Bayesian bridge weigh-in-motion (BBWIM), which combines Bayesian updating and BWIM, is proposed. BBWIM can estimate not only the representative value of axle weights but also the uncertainty of the estimated value and the correlation among estimates. Uncertainties in estimated axle weight are quantitatively discussed with a simple two-axle problem. It is shown that the estimated weights of closely spaced axles have large uncertainty. BBWIM is applied to the measured data for an actual bridge. It is shown that additional information, in the form of a weak constraint on axle weight, namely, that closely spaced axles have similar weights, can reduce the uncertainty of estimated axle weights.<sep>An automatic vehicle monitoring system can provide supports not only for intelligent transportation systems, but also for bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM) systems, which use structural response to identify vehicle weights. In this paper, we provide a vehicle monitoring solution for acceleration-based BWIM system, utilizing deep learning and wavelet transform methods. The monitoring task is divided into three subtasks, including valid sequence detection, valid axle location, and driving lane identification. In first procedure, a shallow convolutional neural network is trained using time-frequency spectrograms to discover valuable time series. After that, an adaptive wavelet transform method is employed to locate axles from each valid sequence. Finally, the driving lane can be determined by cross-comparing vibration responses. Comparing with solutions based on all-in-one deep networks, the proposed method is computationally efficient and has improved generalization capability owing to the three-step division of the task. Evaluation is conducted on a multi-lane highway bridge located in Tokyo. Results show that 97% of vehicles can be identified correctly. For all recognized vehicles, the accuracy of driving lane detection is 100%.<sep>This study explored the feasibility of using an embedded distributed optical-fiber sensors (DOFS) for providing a fully-distributed measurement in pavement structures, in particular that uses Rayleigh-scattering-based optical frequency-domain reflectometry (OFDR). Due to the novelty of this technology, and inherent heterogeneity, roughness and flexibility of pavements, the application of DOFS to asphalt pavements presents several uncertainties in terms of their durability, robustness and long-term stability. Therefore, a series of laboratory tests were performed to examine the performance of a packaged DOFS for measuring the responses under static loads for two types of pavement with different stiffnesses. The packaged DOFS uses a single-mode polyimide-coated optical fiber that is protected by a sheet-type sealing material and covered by a flexible smart mortar. The sensitivity of embedded DOFS was also assessed for three embedment depths (5, 10 and 20 mm). Although the raw data obtained from the DOFS contained a few outliers in some cases, it could obtain the full strain distribution with a high spatial resolution of 0.65 mm, and with a sensitivity similar to that of the traditional strain gauges. Moreover, the location of a load and the time-dependent strain response of the pavement could also be identified.<sep>The method to obtain an accurate influence line (IL) from the direct measurement is an important research topic for structural condition assessment, model correction and bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM) system. The two most common approaches used for the identification of IL are the time-domain (TD) method and the frequency-domain (FD) method. Despite having a similar mathematical framework, the TD and the FD methods are treated as two different methods by the researchers working on this field. This paper presents a detailed theoretical demonstration to show that the two methods discussed above are nothing but the same. The two methods were compared experimentally by using field measurement data on an existing steel girder bridge which were obtained by using three calibration trucks (CTs) with different axle weights and axle configurations. Although the ILs identified by the two methods were apparently different, but a theoretical insight into the frameworks revealed that the TD and FD methods are basically the same and a seeming difference between the two methods is due to the inherent assumptions involved in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) such as the assumption of cyclic nature of analysis interval. Finally, a method to obtain an accurate influence line has been outlined.<sep>Because fatigue damage considerably reduces the service life of steel bridges, maintenance for fatigue damage should be performed properly. For the effective maintenance of fatigue damage, it is important to monitor traffic loads over long periods of time because fatigue damage is caused by repeated high stresses due to the weight of traveling vehicles. This study verified the long-term effectiveness of a portable weigh-in-motion (pBWIM) system through 1-year field measurements conducted on an actual in-service bridge. The pBWIM consists only of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers and MEMS inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are ideal for field measurements because they can be easily attached and detached using a magnetic jig. Furthermore, because MEMS accelerometers and MEMS IMUs are low-power-consumption devices, they are suitable for long-term field measurements. Field measurements were performed using a test truck in winter, summer, and autumn. The results indicate that regardless of the ambient temperature, the pBWIM system can estimate gross vehicle weights (GVWs) within an error of ±10.6% over a 1-year period compared with static weights measured using a truck weighing scale. Furthermore, it is found to be important to determine the dependence of the influence line on ambient temperature to estimate GVWs with high accuracy.<sep>In planning a bridge health monitoring with minimum sensors for long-term monitoring, it is necessary to accurately predict the bridge behavior including its nonlinearity and identify the damaged bridge components when a strong earthquake strikes. This article presents a methodology for the selection of sensors and their arrangement for detecting seismic damage in an in-service steel plate girder bridge system. In this study, a detailed span-based model was developed for the finite element simulation including the effect of the rubber bearing and piers, and the damage control by the side blocks. The finite element dynamic simulation was carried out with input earthquake acceleration to investigate the seismic behavior and grasp the damageable parts during an earthquake. Based on the results of finite element dynamic simulation, a fault tree analysis was carried out to reveal more about the bridge behavior, the failure modes, and the occurrence of damage. It was found that the side block, the bearing stiffener, and the horizontal bracing on the fixed side of the bridge are most important to be monitored for the evaluation of soundness of a plate girder bridge immediately after an earthquake. Finally, a sensor arrangement for the bridge was proposed based on the analysis results.<sep>This paper presents a systematic method for the evaluation of fatigue damage in an existing girder bridge, utilizing the response induced by a moving vehicle. At first, a detailed and accurate finite element model was developed through a two-steps validation process using extracted modal parameters from measured accelerations and bridge displacement responses due to a moving vehicle with known axle weights. Considering real damage scenarios, three commonly found fatigue damages at the welded connections of the gusset plates, soleplates and the crossbeams were numerically simulated including their initiations and subsequent propagations. The effects of these fatigue damage were evaluated through a dynamic analysis and measuring the bridge displacement responses to a moving vehicle thus, portraying the actual in-situ measurement conditions. The static displacement influence lines (DILs) obtained from the measured signals were used as a potential damage indicator against these fatigue damages. A minimal change was observed in DILs due to incipient fatigue cracks; however, significant changes were observed when they propagated substantially, leading to fracture of the main members. For the localization of fatigue cracks, a damage index was defined by estimating the changes in DILs. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed damage detection scheme was checked with respect to the number of sensors and their locations.<sep>There has been a growing demand for early detection of fatigue cracks in gusset plate joints in steel bridges. The present study develops a robust method for crack detection using the concept of transfer learning as an alternative to training an original neural network. Three standard deep learning methods of training a crack classifier using 1) a shallow convolutional neural network built from scratch, 2) the output features of the VGG16 network architecture previously trained on the general ImageNet dataset, and 3) the fine-tuned top layer of VGG16 are investigated. Data augmentation is used to reduce overfitting caused by the limited and imbalanced training dataset. The image dataset includes both fatigue test photographs and actual inspection photographs captured under uncontrolled distance, lighting, angle, and blurriness conditions. Data augmentation increased the accuracy index by 5%, 2%, and 5%, respectively, for the three methods. The fine-tuning methods achieved the best precision and recall scores and the best robustness. Slightly fine-tuning a well-trained fully connected layer together with the top convolutional layer of the VGG16 model in combination with data augmentation achieved the best performance for crack detection in gusset plate joints of steel bridges. Transfer learning methods using the output features of VGG16 achieved both improved accuracy and robustness and, therefore, are recommended for training a crack classifier.<sep>The static bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM) systems are mostly based on strain measurements and are particularly suited for stiff short-span bridges. Recently, the BWIM systems based on acceleration measurements are developed for long-span bridges because of the portability and low-cost of accelerometers as compared to strain gauges. Although, these BWIM systems can estimate the gross vehicle weights (GVWs) with high accuracy, but they fail to identify the weights of individual axles accurately especially for vehicles with closely spaced axles. In this paper, an iterative linear optimization problem (ILOP) was proposed to accurately identify the individual axle weights and GVWs of vehicles traversing a bridge. A BWIM system consisting of only microelectromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometers was employed in an in-service steel girder bridge having multiple lanes. The proposed method used the bridge displacement responses as the measured responses which were determined from the recorded acceleration data. The information about the vehicle speed, number of axles and axle spacings were obtained by identifying the peaks in the recorded acceleration data. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method were demonstrated through field tests using the four-axle test vehicles with closely spaced axles. The results showed that the axle weights of vehicles with closely spaced axles could be identified with much better accuracy by the proposed method as compared to classic BWIM systems which are based on Moses’ original algorithm.<sep>It is important to predict the fatigue conditions of in-service roads for monitoring the state of internal pavement layers, planning the routine maintenance services and for ensuring the safety of travelling vehicles. Among various factors, the frictional heat generated by the tires of moving vehicles is considered to be an important factor causing such a distress in in-service roads. Because of this frictional heat, the temperature of wheel tracks is slightly warmer than other parts of the pavement, thereby, causing a non-uniform distribution of road surface temperature (RST) that may be responsible for developing cracks and subsequent increase in permeability of existing roads. In this study, the effect of travelling vehicles on the RST was investigated by using an infrared (IR) camera in an in-service road. In order to know the actual distribution of temperature, the RSTs were compared between the wheel track of each lane and in-between lanes. Then, the effect of speeds and weights of travelling vehicles on the RST was investigated. A bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM) system using MEMS accelerometers was utilized to identify the speed and weight of a travelling vehicle. A strong correlation was observed between the rise of RST of wheel tracks due to the friction with the speeds and weights of travelling vehicles. The rate of increase in surface temperature was observed to be higher for the higher axle vehicles. Additionally, an influence of ambient air temperature was observed on the relationship between the rise of RST with the speeds and weights of travelling vehicles.<sep>This paper describes field applications of distributed optical fiber sensors (DOFS) for monitoring the traffic load on an existing road. To investigate the optimal embedment depth for DOFS for pavement monitoring, a series of field tests was conducted by considering three embedment depths (10, 30, and 40 mm) and three moving loads (pedestrian, car and truck). The main objectives were to examine the performance of DOFS embedded in the pavement and investigate its suitability and sensitivity for obtaining information about moving loads at various depths from the road surface. Among the existing backscattering light technology, Rayleigh scattering-based Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) was chosen in order to achieve a measurement of high-speed, high range, and good repeatability with a very high spatial resolution of 2.56 mm, all of which are necessary for monitoring dynamic responses due to moving loads. In addition, a data-processing method was developed based on a combination of a Hampel identifier and a low-pass filter, which proved to be effective in removing outliers and high-frequency noise from the raw measurement data, respectively. The results showed that it is not only possible to detect a moving load on a road, but that a wide range of information can also be obtained from the strains measured by DOFS, including the type of load, its speed, its weight, the number of axles, the axle spacings (in the case of a vehicle) and the traffic flow. With low maintenance costs, DOFS based on Rayleigh scattering OFDR could be used for collection of accurate and reliable traffic data when embedded in a pavement.<sep>In addition to causing a static response when traversing a bridge, moving vehicles also produce a dynamic response, which is thought to be one of the factors adversely affecting the accuracy of bridge weigh-in-motion approaches. This paper proposes a novel method for improving the accuracy of such approaches. Rather than modeling the dynamic response directly, the proposed model considers it as noise with autocorrelation. A Bayesian inference approach is considered as it allows a rational way of assimilating data into the model. Here, the dynamic response is considered in the form of a covariance matrix of observation noise, composed of the residuals of the measured and calculated responses, in a Bayesian framework. In a validation study using actual measured data, it was confirmed that the estimation of axle weights in the presence of multiple vehicles was significantly improved. From the result, it can be concluded that proper modeling of the dynamic response in observation data leads to more accurate weigh-in-motion estimates of axle weights and GVW, particularly when complicated vehicle travel is involved. A comparison of static and dynamic influence lines is also discussed using actual measured data. It is shown that the weights estimated by the dynamic influence line are generally more accurate than those by the static influence line when correlation of noise is not considered. The dynamic component in influence line can be interpreted as a regularization term. The proposed method, which uses static influence line and covariance matrix considering correlation of noise, is more accurate than the method with dynamic influence line and also, it does not cause any bias.</abstract>", "<keyword>Programmed cell death<sep>Ex vivo<sep>In vivo<sep>Usual interstitial pneumonia<sep>Cancer cell<sep>Potency<sep>Mesoporous silica<sep>CRISPR<sep>Excipient<sep>Dosage form<sep>Cancer<sep>Genome editing<sep>Drug<sep>Extracellular matrix<sep>KEAP1<sep>DNA damage<sep>Controlled release<sep>Bleomycin<sep>Transfection<sep>Messenger RNA<sep>Antibody<sep>Absorption (acoustics)<sep>Immune system<sep>Dosing<sep>Cmax<sep>Lung<sep>Immunogenic cell death<sep>Stomach<sep>Magnetic resonance imaging<sep>Pulmonary fibrosis<sep>Prodrug<sep>Aerosolization<sep>Synthetic lethality<sep>Aptamer<sep>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis<sep>Nanoparticle<sep>Peptide<sep>Cytotoxic T cell<sep>Dry-powder inhaler<sep>Inhalation exposure<sep>Pharmacokinetics<sep>Tolerability<sep>Inhalation<sep>Carbene<sep>CD8<sep>Redox<sep>Niclosamide<sep>Albumin<sep>Conjugate<sep>Swelling</keyword><title>Rationally Designed Redox-Active Au(I) N-Heterocyclic Carbene: An Immunogenic Cell Death Inducer<sep>In vivo pharmacokinetic study of remdesivir dry powder for inhalation in hamsters<sep>In<i>Vivo</i>Pharmacokinetic Study of Remdesivir Dry Powder for Inhalation in Hamsters<sep>CRISPR metabolic screen identifies ATM and KEAP1 as targetable genetic vulnerabilities in solid tumors<sep>Development of an Excipient-Free Peptide Dry Powder Inhalation for the Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis<sep>Niclosamide inhalation powder made by thin-film freezing: Multi-dose tolerability and exposure in rats and pharmacokinetics in hamsters<sep>Dual Nanoparticle Conjugates for Highly Sensitive and Versatile Sensing Using <sup>19</sup>F Magnetic Resonance Imaging<sep>Hydrophilic Poly(urethanes) Are an Effective Tool for Gastric Retention Independent of Drug Release Rate<sep>Immunogenic cell death-inducing metal complexes: From the benchtop to the clinic<sep>Late Breaking Abstract - Caveolin-1 derived peptide LTI-03 promotes epithelial cell survival and attenuates pulmonary fibrosis<sep>Optimization of ionizable lipids for aerosolizable <scp>mRNA</scp> lipid nanoparticles<sep>Inhaled JAK Inhibitor GDC-0214 Nanoaggregate Powder Exhibits Improved Pharmacokinetic Profile in Rats Compared to the Micronized Form: Benefits of Thin Film Freezing<sep>Electrostatic-driven Interactions Enhance Intratumoral Retention and Antitumor Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Blockade Antibodies<sep>Niclosamide Inhalation Powder Made by Thin-Film Freezing: Pharmacokinetic and Toxicology Studies in Rats and Hamsters<sep>Controlled loading of albumin-drug conjugates ex vivo for enhanced drug delivery and antitumor efficacy</title><abstract>Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a way of reengaging the tumor-specific immune system. ICD can be induced by treatment with chemotherapeutics. However, only a limited number of drugs and other treatment modalities have been shown to elicit the biomarker responses characteristic of ICD and to provide an anticancer benefit in vivo. Here, we report a rationally designed redox-active Au(I) bis-N-heterocyclic carbene that induces ICD both in vitro and in vivo. This work benefits from a synthetic pathway that allows for the facile preparation of asymmetric redox-active Au(I) bis-N-heterocyclic carbenes.<sep>Remdesivir dry powder for inhalation was previously developed using thin film freezing (TFF). A single-dose 24-h pharmacokinetic study in hamsters demonstrated that pulmonary delivery of TFF remdesivir can achieve plasma remdesivir and GS-441524 levels higher than the reported EC50s of both remdesivir and GS-441524 (in human epithelial cells) over 20 h. The half-life of GS-4412524 following dry powder insufflation was about 7 h, suggesting the dosing regimen would be twice-daily administration. Although the remdesivir-Captisol® (80/20 w/w) formulation showed faster and greater absorption of remdesivir and GS-4412524 in the lung, remdesivir-leucine (80/20 w/w) exhibited a greater Cmax with shorter Tmax and lower AUC of GS-441524, indicating lower total drug exposure is required to achieve a high effective concentration against SAR-CoV-2. In conclusion, remdesivir dry powder for inhalation would be a promising alternative dosage form for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.<sep>Abstract Remdesivir dry powder for inhalation was previously developed using thin film freezing (TFF).

To identify such alternative pathways, we screened for metabolic pathways exhibiting synthetic lethality with inhibition of the DNA damage response kinase Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) using a metabolism-centered Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 library. Our data revealed Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) as a key factor involved in desensitizing cancer cells to ATM inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Cells depleted of KEAP1 exhibited an aberrant overexpression of the cystine transporter SLC7A11, robustly accumulated cystine inducing disulfide stress, and became hypersensitive to ATM inhibition. These hallmarks were reversed in a reducing cellular environment indicating that disulfide stress was a crucial factor. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer datasets, we found that ATM levels negatively correlated with KEAP1 levels across multiple solid malignancies. Together, our results unveil ATM and KEAP1 as new targetable vulnerabilities in solid tumors.<sep>The caveolin scaffolding domain peptide (CSP) is being developed for the therapeutic intervention of a lethal lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. While direct respiratory delivery of CSP7 (a 7-mer fragment of CSP) is considered an effective route, proper formulation and processing of the peptide are required. First, air-jet milling technology was performed in order to micronize the neat peptide powder. Next, the fine particles were subjected to a stability study with physical and chemical characterizations. In addition, the in vivo efficacy of processed CSP7 powder was evaluated in an animal model of lung fibrosis. The results revealed that, with jet milling, the particle size of CSP7 was reduced to a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 1.58 ± 0.1 μm and 93.3 ± 3.3% fine particle fraction, optimal for deep lung delivery. A statistically significant reduction of collagen was observed in diseased lung tissues of mice that received CSP7 powder for inhalation. The particles remained chemically and physically stable after micronization and during storage. This work demonstrated that jet milling is effective in the manufacturing of a stable, excipient-free CSP7 inhalation powder for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.<sep>In this work, we have developed and tested a dry powder form of niclosamide made by thin-film freezing (TFF) and administered it by inhalation to rats and hamsters to gather data about its toxicology and pharmacokinetics. Niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug, is an interesting drug candidate because it was approved over 60 years ago for use as an anthelmintic medication, but recent studies demonstrated its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral with pharmacological effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. TFF was used to develop a niclosamide inhalation powder composition that exhibited acceptable aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 86.0% and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.11 µm and 2.84, respectively. This formulation not only proved to be safe after an acute three-day, multi-dose tolerability and exposure study in rats as evidenced by histopathology analysis, and also was able to achieve lung concentrations above the required IC90 levels for at least 24 h after a single administration in a Syrian hamster model. To conclude, we successfully developed a niclosamide dry powder inhalation that overcomes niclosamide's limitation of poor oral bioavailability by targeting the drug directly to the primary site of infection, the lungs.<sep>Fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (19 F MRI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional 1 H MRI due to enhanced specificity deriving from negligible background signal in this modality. We report a dual nanoparticle conjugate (DNC) platform as an aptamer-based sensor for use in 19 F MRI. DNC consists of core-shell nanoparticles with a liquid perfluorocarbon core and a mesoporous silica shell (19 F-MSNs), which give a robust 19 F MR signal, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as magnetic quenchers. Due to the strong magnetic quenching effects of SPIONs, this platform is uniquely sensitive and functions with a low concentration of SPIONs (4 equivalents) relative to 19 F-MSNs. The probe functions as a \"turn-on\" sensor using target-induced dissociation of DNA aptamers. The thrombin binding aptamer was incorporated as a proof-of-concept (DNCThr ), and we demonstrate a significant increase in 19 F MR signal intensity when DNCThr is incubated with human α-thrombin. This proof-of-concept probe is highly versatile and can be adapted to sense ATP and kanamycin as well. Importantly, DNCThr generates a robust 19 F MRI \"hot-spot\" signal in response to thrombin in live mice, establishing this platform as a practical, versatile, and biologically relevant molecular imaging probe.<sep>Acyclovir is a poorly permeable, short half-life drug with poor colonic absorption, and current conventional controlled release formulations are unable to decrease the frequency of administration. We designed acyclovir dosage forms to be administered less frequently by being retained in the stomach and releasing drug over an extended duration. We developed a conventional modified-release matrix tablet to sustain the release of acyclovir and surrounded it with a hydrophilic poly(urethane) layer. When hydrated, the porous poly(urethane) swells to a size near or beyond that of the relaxed pylorus diameter and does not affect drug release rate. We demonstrated that the formulation is retained in the stomach for extended durations as it slowly releases drug, allowing for similar area under the curve but delayed tmax relative to a nongastroretentive control tablet. Unlike many other gastroretentive formulations, this dosage form design decouples drug release rate from gastric retention time, allowing them to be modulated independently. It also effectively retains in the stomach regardless of the prandial state, differentiating from other approaches. Our direct observation of excised rat stomachs allowed for a rigorous assessment of the impact of polymer swelling extent and the prandial state on both the dosage form integrity and retention time.<sep>The immune system presents a complex array of processes designed to maintain homeostasis in malignant cellular growth. Malignancy is the result of a breakdown in immune surveillance by cancer cells evading immune recognition. Significant efforts have been made in modulating immune checkpoint signaling cascades to bypass the resulting immune evasion and establish an anticancer effect. More recently, it was discovered that a form of regulated cell death can involve the stimulation of immune response as its downstream effect and subsequently re-establish immune surveillance. This mechanism, known as immunogenic cell death (ICD), is being exploited as a target to prevent tumor relapse and prevent cancer metastasis. It is now appreciated that metal-based compounds play a key role in ICD activation due to their unique biochemical properties and interactions within cancer cells. With fewer than 1% of known anticancer agents documented as ICD inducers, recent efforts have been made to identify novel entities capable of stimulating a more potent anticancer immune response. While the recent reviews by us or others focus primarily on either discussing the chemical library of ICD inducers or intricate detailing of biological pathways associated with ICD, this review aims to bridge these two topics as a concise summary. Furthermore, early clinical evidence and future directions of ICD are briefly summarized.<sep>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with progressive destruction of the lung parenchyma with a median survival after diagnosis of three years and a five-year survival of &lt;20%. Caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) is comprised of amino acid sequences 82-101 of the NH2 terminal region and plays a role in Caveolin-1 dimerization as well as the regulation of diverse signaling intermediates, many of which are implicated in lung fibrosis. Loss of Cav-1 protein is observed in many fibrotic diseases. Furthermore, Cav-1 deficient mice demonstrate impaired wound healing and lung morphology resembling fibrosis which is reversible with CSD peptides. LTI-03, is a seven amino acid sequence derived from the CSD domain of Cav-1. LTI-03 was efficacious in multiple mouse models of lung fibrosis (Adv-TGF-b, single bleomycin intranasal or intratracheal, and repetitive bleomycin) when delivered intraperitoneally, nebulized or as a dry powder, during the fibrotic phase of lung injury. LTI-03 treatment resulted in significantly reduced ECM proteins such as collagen in mouse lung homogenate and reduced fibrosis as measured by uCT scan and trichrome staining. Importantly, a dose dependent increase in epithelial cell survival was detected in precision cut lung slices biopsied from both non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and end-stage IPF patients, treated with LTI-03 at physiologically relevant doses. Epithelial cell survival was measured via lysotracker staining (n=5). Furthermore, AEC2 cell markers ABCA3 and SPC were increased. LTI-03’s anti-fibrotic effects on both epithelial and fibroblasts render it a strong candidate for IPF therapy.<sep>Although mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are highly effective as vaccines, their efficacy for pulmonary delivery has not yet fully been established. A major barrier to this therapeutic goal is their instability during aerosolization for local delivery. This imparts a shear force that degrades the mRNA cargo and therefore reduces cell transfection. In addition to remaining stable upon aerosolization, mRNA LNPs must also possess the aerodynamic properties to achieve deposition in clinically relevant areas of the lungs. We addressed these challenges by formulating mRNA LNPs with SM-102, the clinically approved ionizable lipid in the Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine. Our lead candidate, B-1, had the highest mRNA expression in both a physiologically relevant air-liquid interface (ALI) human lung cell model and in healthy mice lungs upon aerosolization. Further, B-1 showed selective transfection in vivo of lung epithelial cells compared to immune cells and endothelial cells. These results show that the formulation can target therapeutically relevant cells in pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Morphological studies of B-1 revealed differences in the surface structure compared to LNPs with lower transfection efficiency. Importantly, the formulation maintained critical aerodynamic properties in simulated human airways upon next generation impaction. Finally, structure-function analysis of SM-102 revealed that small changes in the number of carbons can improve upon mRNA delivery in ALI human lung cells. Overall, our study expands the application of SM-102 and its analogs to aerosolized pulmonary delivery and identifies a potent lead candidate for future therapeutically active mRNA therapies.<sep>Asthma is a common chronic disease affecting the airways in the lungs. The receptors of allergic cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, trigger the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, which involves the pathogenesis of asthma. GDC-0214 is a JAK inhibitor that was developed as a potent and selective target for the treatment of asthma, specifically targeting the lungs. While inhaled GDC-0214 is a promising novel treatment option against asthma, improvement is still needed to achieve increased potency of the powder formulation and a reduced number of capsules containing powder to be inhaled. In this study, high-potency amorphous powder formulations containing GDC-0214 nanoaggregates for dry powder inhalation were developed using particle engineering technology, thin film freezing (TFF). A high dose per capsule was successfully achieved by enhancing the solubility of GDC-0214 and powder conditioning. Lactose and/or leucine as excipients exhibited optimum stability and aerosolization of GDC-0214 nanoaggregates, and aerosolization of the dose was independent of air flow through the device between 2 and 6 kPa pressure drops. In the rat PK study, formulation F20, which contains 80% GDC-0214 and 20% lactose, resulted in the highest AUC0-24h in the lungs with the lowest AUC0-24h in the plasma that corresponds to a 4.8-fold higher ratio of the lung-to-plasma exposures compared to micronized crystalline GDC-0214 powder administered by dry powder inhalation. Therefore, GDC-0214 nanoaggregates produced by TFF provided an improved dry powder for inhalation that can lead to enhanced therapeutic efficacy with a lower risk of systemic toxicity.<sep>ABSTRACT Tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) forms a net negative charged network that interacts with and hinders the transport of molecules partly based on electrostatic interactions. The focus on drug delivery in solid tumors has traditionally been on developing neutral charge coatings to minimize interactions with the ECM for improved transport. In contrast to this prior work, we recently found a cationic peptide that interacted electrostatically with the negatively charged components of the ECM, resulting in enhanced uptake and retention of nanoparticles in tumor ECM and tumor tissue. Based on this previous study, here, we hypothesize that the electrostatically driven interactions of the cationic peptide will improve the binding and retention of immune checkpoint blockade antibodies (ICBs), ultimately enhancing their antitumor immunogenic responses. We prepared peptide antibody (Ab) conjugates by conjugating the cationic peptide to ICBs, anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (∝-CTLA4) and anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (∝-PD-L1) Abs, using copper-free click chemistry. We confirmed an average of 1 – 2 peptides per Ab. The cationic peptide electrostatically interacted with the net negatively charged tumor ECM and improved the binding of the Abs to the tumor ECM without affecting their antigen recognition capacities. Modifying the Abs due to cationic peptide conjugation reduced the systemic exposure of the Abs and did not induce treatment-related toxicities. We quantified a significantly higher population of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells and a significant depletion of regulatory T cells in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes upon peptide conjugation, which resulted in a better therapeutic outcome of the ICBs. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY Electrostatic interaction-based intratumoral retention enhances antitumor responses of immune checkpoint blockade antibodies upon local administration.<sep>Abstract In this work, we have developed and tested in vivo a dry powder form of niclosamide made by thin-film freezing (TFF) and administered it by inhalation to rats and hamsters. The niclosamide dry powder, suitable for inhalation, is being developed as a therapeutic agent against COVID-19 infection. Niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug, is an interesting drug candidate because it was approved over 60 years ago for use as an anthelmintic medication, but recent studies demonstrated its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral with a specific pharmacological effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the past, clinical trials for other indications were terminated prior to completion due to low and highly variable oral bioavailability. In order to quickly address the current pandemic, targeting niclosamide directly to the lungs is rational to address the COVID-19 main clinical complications. Thin-film freezing technology was used to develop a niclosamide inhalation powder composition that exhibited acceptable aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 86.0% and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.11 μm and 2.84, respectively. This formulation not only proved to be safe after an acute three-day, multi-dose pharmacokinetic study in rats as evidenced by histopathology analysis, but also was able to achieve lung concentrations above the required IC 50 and IC 90 levels for at least 24 h after a single administration in a Syrian hamster model. To conclude, we successfully developed a niclosamide dry powder inhalation formulation by thin-film freezing for further scale-up and clinical testing against the COVID-19 infection. This approach overcomes niclosamide’s limitation of poor oral bioavailability by targeting the drug directly to the primary site of infection, the lungs.<sep>To harness the intrinsic transport properties of albumin yet improve the therapeutic index of current in situ albumin-binding prodrugs, we developed albumin-drug conjugates with a controlled loading that achieved better antitumor efficacy. Here, model drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) was conjugated ex vivo to Cys34 of albumin via a cathepsin B-sensitive dipeptide linker to ensure that all drug would be bound specifically to albumin. The resulting albumin-drug conjugate with a drug to albumin ratio (DAR) of 1 (ALDC1) retained the native secondary structure of albumin compared to conjugate with a higher DAR of 3 (ALDC3). ALDC1 exhibited improved drug release and cytotoxicity compared to ALDC3 in vitro. Slower plasma clearance and increased drug exposure over time of ALDC1 were observed compared to ALDC3 and MMAE prodrug. In single dose studies with MIA PaCa2 xenografts, cohorts treated with ALDC1 had the highest amount of MMAE drug in tumor tissues compared to other treatment arms. After multiple dosing, ALDC1 significantly delayed the tumor growth compared to control treatment arms MMAE, MMAE-linker conjugate and ALDC3. When dosed with the maximum tolerated dose of ALDC1, there was complete eradication of 83.33% of the tumors in the treatment group. Ex vivo conjugated ALDC1 also significantly inhibited tumor growth in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model that better recapitulates the phenotype and clinical features of human pancreatic cancers. In summary, site-specific loading of drug to albumin at 1:1 ratio allowed the conjugate to better maintain the native structure of albumin and its intrinsic properties. By conjugating the drug to albumin prior to administration minimized premature cleavage and instability of the drug in plasma and enabled higher drug accumulation in tumors compared to in situ albumin-binding prodrugs. This strategy to control drug loading ex vivo ensures complete drug binding to the albumin carrier and achieves excellent antitumor efficacy, and it has the potential to greatly improve the outcomes of anticancer therapy.</abstract>", "<keyword>Transactivation<sep>Senescence<sep>Acetaldehyde<sep>Disease<sep>Diabetes mellitus<sep>Progenitor cell<sep>Neuroinflammation<sep>Lysosome<sep>In vivo<sep>Transgene<sep>Genetically modified mouse<sep>Astrocyte<sep>Secretion<sep>CYP2E1<sep>In vitro<sep>Metabolism<sep>Necrosis<sep>CTL*<sep>Extracellular<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Liver injury<sep>Hepatitis B virus<sep>Immune system<sep>Pancreas<sep>Hepatocyte<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Transplantation<sep>TIMP1<sep>Cirrhosis<sep>Liver disease<sep>Microvesicles<sep>Nicotine<sep>microRNA<sep>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Angiogenesis<sep>Pancreatitis<sep>Alcohol<sep>Chemokine<sep>Hepatic stellate cell<sep>Lipopolysaccharide<sep>Virus<sep>Cytotoxic T cell<sep>Enzyme<sep>MHC class I<sep>Inflammasome<sep>Crosstalk<sep>Extracellular vesicle<sep>Extracellular vesicles<sep>Downregulation and upregulation<sep>Stem cell<sep>Haematopoiesis<sep>Acute pancreatitis<sep>RNA interference<sep>Biogenesis<sep>Oxidative stress<sep>Humanized mouse<sep>Hepatocellular carcinoma<sep>Viral hepatitis<sep>Gene<sep>Gene silencing</keyword><title>Alcohol: basic and translational research; 15th annual Charles Lieber &amp;1st Samuel French satellite symposium<sep>Intranasal Delivery of lincRNA-Cox2 siRNA Loaded Extracellular Vesicles Decreases Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Microglial Proliferation in Mice<sep>Cell-to-Cell Communications in Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease<sep>Biogenesis, physiological functions and potential applications of extracellular vesicles in substance use disorders<sep>Pancreatogenic Diabetes: Triggering Effects of Alcohol and HIV<sep>Establishment of the Dual Humanized TK-NOG Mouse Model for HIV-associated Liver Pathogenesis<sep>Alcohol-Induced Lysosomal Damage and Suppression of Lysosome Biogenesis Contribute to Hepatotoxicity in HIV-Exposed Liver Cells<sep>Alcohol Metabolism Potentiates HIV-Induced Hepatotoxicity: Contribution to End-Stage Liver Disease<sep>Neuronal‐derived extracellular vesicles are enriched in the brain and serum of HIV‐1 transgenic rats<sep>A review of alcohol–pathogen interactions: New insights into combined disease pathomechanisms<sep>Strategies for the use of Extracellular Vesicles for the Delivery of Therapeutics<sep>Involvement of lncRNA TUG1 in HIV-1 Tat-Induced Astrocyte Senescence<sep>Alcohol-and-HIV-Induced Lysosomal Dysfunction Regulates Extracellular Vesicles Secretion in Vitro and in Liver-Humanized Mice<sep>Ethanol attenuates presentation of cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte epitopes on hepatocytes of HBV‐infected humanized mice<sep>Alcohol and HIV-Derived Hepatocyte Apoptotic Bodies Induce Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation<sep>Human-like NSG mouse glycoproteins sialylation pattern changes the phenotype of human lymphocytes and sensitivity to HIV-1 infection<sep>Obeticholic acid attenuates human immunodeficiency virus/alcohol metabolism-induced pro-fibrotic activation in liver cells</title><abstract>The present review is based on the research presented at the symposium dedicated to the legacy of the two scientists that made important discoveries in the field of alcohol-induced liver damage: Professors C.S. Lieber and S.W. French. The invited speakers described pharmacological, toxicological and patho-physiological effects of alcohol misuse. Moreover, genetic biomarkers determining adverse drug reactions due to interactions between therapeutics used for chronic or infectious diseases and alcohol exposure were discussed. The researchers presented their work in areas of alcohol-induced impairment in lipid protein trafficking and endocytosis, as well as the role of lipids in the development of fatty liver. The researchers showed that alcohol leads to covalent modifications that promote hepatic dysfunction and injury. We concluded that using new advanced techniques and research ideas leads to important discoveries in science.<sep>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), play an important regulatory role in controlling various biological processes. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that lincRNA-Cox2 plays a global regulatory role in regulating the expression of immune genes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived nanosized membrane vesicles that have gained increasing attention in recent years due to their ability to efficiently deliver therapeutics to specific target organs or cell types. In this study, we found that lincRNA-Cox2 controls the expression of a set of cell cycle genes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells. Our in vitro study suggested that knocking down lincRNA-Cox2 reversed LPS-induced microglial proliferation. In addition, our in vivo study demonstrated that intranasally delivered lincRNA-Cox2-siRNA loaded EVs could reach the brain resulting in a significant decrease in the expression of lincRNA-Cox2 in the microglia. Importantly, lincRNA-Cox2-siRNA loaded EVs also decreased LPS-induced microglial proliferation in mice. These findings indicate that intranasal delivery of EV-loaded small RNA could be developed as therapeutics for treatment of a multitude of CNS disorders.<sep>This review covers some important new aspects of the alcohol-induced communications between liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells leading to liver injury development. The information exchange between various cell types may promote end-stage liver disease progression and involves multiple mechanisms, such as direct cell-to-cell interactions, extracellular vesicles (EVs) or chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors contained in extracellular fluids/cell culture supernatants. Here, we highlighted the role of EVs derived from alcohol-exposed hepatocytes (HCs) in activation of non-parenchymal cells, liver macrophages (LM), and hepatic stellate cells (HSC). The review also concentrates on EV-mediated crosstalk between liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells in the settings of HIV- and alcohol co-exposure. In addition, we overviewed the literature on the crosstalk between cell death pathways and inflammasome activation in alcohol-activated HCs and macrophages. Furthermore, we covered highly clinically relevant studies on the role of non-inflammatory factors, sinusoidal pressure (SP), and hepatic arterialization in alcohol-induced hepatic fibrogenesis. We strongly believe that the review will disclose major mechanisms of cell-to-cell communications pertained to alcohol-induced liver injury progression and will identify therapeutically important targets, which can be used for alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) prevention.<sep>Substance use disorder (SUD) is a growing health problem that affects several millions of people worldwide, resulting in negative socioeconomic impacts and increased health care costs. Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in SUD pathogenesis. EVs, including exosomes and microvesicles, are membrane-encapsulated particles that are released into the extracellular space by most types of cells. EVs are important players in mediating cell-to-cell communication through transfer of cargo such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. The EV cargo can alter the status of recipient cells, thereby contributing to both physiological and pathological processes; some of these play critical roles in SUD. Although the functions of EVs under several pathological conditions have been extensively reviewed, EV functions and potential applications in SUD remain less studied. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the role of EVs in SUD, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, nicotine and opiate abuse. The review will focus on the biogenesis and cargo composition of EVs as well as the potential use of EVs as biomarkers of SUD or therapeutic targets in SUD.<sep>Multiorgan failure may not be completely resolved among people living with HIV despite HAART use. Although the chances of organ dysfunction may be relatively low, alcohol may potentiate HIV-induced toxic effects in the organs of alcohol-abusing, HIV-infected individuals. The pancreas is one of the most implicated organs, which is manifested as diabetes mellitus or pancreatic cancer. Both alcohol and HIV may trigger pancreatitis, but the combined effects have not been explored. The aim of this review is to explore the literature for understanding the mechanisms of HIV and alcohol-induced pancreatotoxicity. We found that while premature alcohol-inducing zymogen activation is a known trigger of alcoholic pancreatitis, HIV entry through C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) into pancreatic acinar cells may also contribute to pancreatitis in people living with HIV (PLWH). HIV proteins induce oxidative and ER stresses, causing necrosis. Furthermore, infiltrative immune cells induce necrosis on HIV-containing acinar cells. When necrotic products interact with pancreatic stellate cells, they become activated, leading to the release of both inflammatory and profibrotic cytokines and resulting in pancreatitis. Effective therapeutic strategies should block CCR5 and ameliorate alcohol’s effects on acinar cells.<sep>Despite the increased life expectancy of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), liver disease has emerged as a common cause of their morbidity. The liver immunopathology caused by HIV-1 remains elusive. Small xenograft animal models with human hepatocytes and human immune system can recapitulate the human biology of the disease's pathogenesis. Herein, a protocol is described to establish a dual humanized mouse model through human hepatocytes and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) transplantation, to study liver immunopathology as observed in HIV-infected patients. To achieve dual reconstitution, male TK-NOG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Sug Tg(Alb-TK)7-2/ShiJic) mice are intraperitoneally injected with ganciclovir (GCV) doses to eliminate mouse transgenic liver cells, and with treosulfan for nonmyeloablative conditioning, both of which facilitate human hepatocyte (HEP) engraftment and human immune system (HIS) development. Human albumin (ALB) levels are evaluated for liver engraftment, and the presence of human immune cells in blood detected by flow cytometry confirms the establishment of human immune system. The model developed using the protocol described here resembles multiple components of liver damage from HIV-1 infection. Its establishment could prove to be essential for studies of hepatitis virus co-infection and for the evaluation of antiviral and antiretroviral drugs.<sep>Although the causes of hepatotoxicity among alcohol-abusing HIV patients are multifactorial, alcohol remains the least explored \"second hit\" for HIV-related hepatotoxicity. Here, we investigated whether metabolically derived acetaldehyde impairs lysosomes to enhance HIV-induced hepatotoxicity. We exposed Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1)-expressing Huh 7.5 (also known as RLW) cells to an acetaldehyde-generating system (AGS) for 24 h. We then infected (or not) the cells with HIV-1ADA then exposed them again to AGS for another 48 h. Lysosome damage was assessed by galectin 3/LAMP1 co-localization and cathepsin leakage. Expression of lysosome biogenesis-transcription factor, TFEB, was measured by its protein levels and by in situ immunofluorescence. Exposure of cells to both AGS + HIV caused the greatest amount of lysosome leakage and its impaired lysosomal biogenesis, leading to intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, the movement of TFEB from cytosol to the nucleus via microtubules was impaired by AGS exposure. The latter impairment appeared to occur by acetylation of α-tubulin. Moreover, ZKSCAN3, a repressor of lysosome gene activation by TFEB, was amplified by AGS. Both these changes contributed to AGS-elicited disruption of lysosome biogenesis. Our findings indicate that metabolically generated acetaldehyde damages lysosomes and likely prevents their repair and restoration, thereby exacerbating HIV-induced hepatotoxicity.<sep>In an era of improved survival due to modern antiretroviral therapy, liver disease has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality, resulting in death in 15-17% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Alcohol enhances HIV-mediated liver damage and promotes the progression to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, the mechanisms behind these events are uncertain. Here, we hypothesize that ethanol metabolism potentiates accumulation of HIV in hepatocytes, causing oxidative stress and intensive apoptotic cell death. Engulfment of HIV-containing apoptotic hepatocytes by non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) triggers their activation and liver injury progression. This study was performed on primary human hepatocytes and Huh7.5-CYP cells infected with HIV-1ADA, and major findings were confirmed by pilot data obtained on ethanol-fed HIV-injected chimeric mice with humanized livers. We demonstrated that ethanol exposure potentiates HIV accumulation in hepatocytes by suppressing HIV degradation by lysosomes and proteasomes. This leads to increased oxidative stress and hepatocyte apoptosis. Exposure of HIV-infected apoptotic hepatocytes to NPCs activates the inflammasome in macrophages and pro-fibrotic genes in hepatic stellate cells. We conclude that while HIV and ethanol metabolism-triggered apoptosis clears up HIV-infected hepatocytes, continued generation of HIV-expressing apoptotic bodies may be detrimental for progression of liver inflammation and fibrosis due to constant activation of NPCs.<sep>ABSTRACT Despite the efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV‐1) replication, cytotoxic viral proteins such as HIV‐1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) persist in tissues such as the brain. Although HIV‐1 does not infect neuronal cells, it is susceptible to viral Tat protein‐mediated toxicity, leading to neuroinflammation that underlies HIV‐associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Given the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in both cellular homoeostasis and under pathological conditions, we sought to investigate the alterations in the quantity of neuronal‐derived EVs in the brain – as defined by the presence of cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM) and to evaluate the presence of L1CAM + EVs in the peripheral circulation of HIV‐1 transgenic (HIV‐1 Tg) rats. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the effect of long‐term exposure of HIV‐1 viral proteins on the release of neuronal EVs in the brain and their transfer in the systemic compartment. Brain and serum EVs were isolated from both wild type and HIV‐1 Tg rats using differential ultracentrifugation with further purification using the Optiprep gradient method. The subpopulation of neuronal EVs was further enriched using immunoprecipitation. The current findings demonstrated increased presence of L1CAM + neuronal‐derived EVs both in the brain and serum of HIV‐1 Tg rats.<sep>Abstract Progression of chronic infections to end‐stage diseases and poor treatment results are frequently associated with alcohol abuse. Alcohol metabolism suppresses innate and adaptive immunity leading to increased viral load and its spread. In case of hepatotropic infections, viruses accelerate alcohol‐induced hepatitis and liver fibrosis, thereby promoting end‐stage outcomes, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this review, we concentrate on several unexplored aspects of these phenomena, which illustrate the combined effects of viral/bacterial infections and alcohol in disease development. We review alcohol‐induced alterations implicated in immunometabolism as a central mechanism impacting metabolic homeostasis and viral pathogenesis in Simian immunodeficiency virus/human immunodeficiency virus infection. Furthermore, in hepatocytes, both HIV infection and alcohol activate oxidative stress to cause lysosomal dysfunction and leakage and apoptotic cell death, thereby increasing hepatotoxicity. In addition, we discuss the mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma and tumor signaling in hepatitis C virus infection. Finally, we analyze studies that review and describe the immune derangements in hepatotropic viral infections focusing on the development of novel targets and strategies to restore effective immunocompetency in alcohol‐associated liver disease. In conclusion, alcohol exacerbates the pathogenesis of viral infections, contributing to a chronic course and poor outcomes, but the mechanisms behind these events are virus specific and depend on virus–alcohol interactions, which differ among the various infections.<sep>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized, membrane-bound vesicles released from eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells that can transport cargo containing DNA, RNA, lipids and proteins, between cells as a means of intercellular communication. Although EVs were initially considered to be cellular debris deprived of any essential biological functions, emerging literature highlights the critical roles of EVs in the context of intercellular signaling, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, modulation of immune responses, inflammation, cancer progression, angiogenesis, and coagulation under both physiological and pathological states. Based on the ability of EVs to shuttle proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs, chromosomal DNA, and mitochondrial DNA into target cells, the presence and content of EVs in biofluids have been exploited for biomarker research in the context of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies. Additionally, owing to the characteristics of EVs such as stability in circulation, biocompatibility as well as low immunogenicity and toxicity, these vesicles have become attractive systems for the delivery of therapeutics. More recently, EVs are increasingly being exploited as conduits for delivery of therapeutics for anticancer strategies, immunomodulation, targeted drug delivery, tissue regeneration, and vaccination. In this review, we highlight and discuss the multiple strategies that are employed for the use of EVs as delivery vehicles for therapeutic agents, including the potential advantages and challenges involved.<sep>HIV-1 infection in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy has been associated with premature aging. Among the various features of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders, astrocyte senescence has been surmised as a potential cause contributing to HIV-1-induced brain aging and neurocognitive impairments. Recently, lncRNAs have also been implicated to play essential roles in the onset of cellular senescence. Herein, using human primary astrocytes (HPAs), we investigated the role of lncRNA TUG1 in HIV-1 Tat-mediated onset of astrocyte senescence. We found that HPAs exposed to HIV-1 Tat resulted in significant upregulation of lncRNA TUG1 expression that was accompanied by elevated expression of p16 and p21, respectively. Additionally, HIV-1 Tat-exposed HPAs demonstrated increased expression of senescence-associated (SA) markers—SA-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity and SA-heterochromatin foci—cell-cycle arrest, and increased production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines. Intriguingly, gene silencing of lncRNA TUG1 in HPAs also reversed HIV-1 Tat-induced upregulation of p21, p16, SA-β gal activity, cellular activation, and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, increased expression of astrocytic p16 and p21, lncRNA TUG1, and proinflammatory cytokines were observed in the prefrontal cortices of HIV-1 transgenic rats, thereby suggesting the occurrence of senescence activation in vivo. Overall, our data indicate that HIV-1 Tat-induced astrocyte senescence involves the lncRNA TUG1 and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for dampening accelerated aging associated with HIV-1/HIV-1 proteins.<sep>Alcohol abuse is common in people living with HIV-1 and dramaticallyenhances the severity of HIV-induced liver damage by inducing oxidative stress and lysosomaldysfunction in the liver cells. We hypothesize that the increased release of extracellular vesicles(EVs) in hepatocytes and liver humanized mouse model is linked to lysosome dysfunction.The study was performed on primary human hepatocytes and human hepatoma RLWXP-GFP (Huh7.5 cells stably transfected with CYP2E1 and XPack-GFP) cells and validated on ethanol-fed liverhumanizedfumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-/-, Rag2-/-, common cytokine receptor gamma chainknockout (FRG-KO) mice. Cells and mice were infected with HIV-1ADA virus.We observedan increase in the secretion of EVs associated with a decrease in lysosomal activity and expressionof lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1. Next-generation RNA sequencing of primary humanhepatocytes revealed 63 differentially expressed genes, with 13 downregulated and 50 upregulatedgenes in the alcohol-HIV-treated group. Upstream regulator analysis of differentially expressedgenes through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified transcriptional regulators affecting downstreamgenes associated with increased oxidative stress, lysosomal associated disease, and function andEVs biogenesis. Our in vitro findings were corroborated by in vivo studies on human hepatocytetransplantedhumanized mice, indicating that intensive EVs' generation by human hepatocytes andtheir secretion to serum was associated with increased oxidative stress and reduction in lysosomalactivities triggered by HIV infection and ethanol diet.HIV-and-ethanol-metabolisminducedEVs release is tightly controlled by lysosome status in hepatocytes and participates in thedevelopment of double-insult-induced liver injury.<sep>Approximately 3.5% of the global population is chronically infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), which puts them at high risk of end-stage liver disease, with the risk of persistent infection potentiated by alcohol consumption. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of alcohol on HBV persistence remain unclear. Here, we aimed to establish in vivo/ex vivo evidence that alcohol suppresses HBV peptides-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen display on primary human hepatocytes (PHH), which diminishes the recognition and clearance of HBV-infected hepatocytes by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).We used fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-/-, Rag2-/-, common cytokine receptor gamma chain knock-out (FRG-KO) humanized mice transplanted with human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2)-positive hepatocytes. The mice were HBV-infected and fed control and alcohol diets. Isolated hepatocytes were exposed ex vivo to HBV 18-27-HLA-A2-restricted CTLs to quantify cytotoxicity. For mechanistic studies, we measured proteasome activities, unfolded protein response (UPR), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes from HBV-infected humanized mouse livers.We found that alcohol feeding attenuated HBV core 18-27-HLA-A2 complex presentation on infected hepatocytes due to the suppression of proteasome function and ER stress induction, which diminished both the processing of HBV peptides and trafficking of HBV-MHC class I complexes to the hepatocyte surface. This alcohol-mediated decrease in MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation of the CTL epitope on target hepatocytes reduced the CTL-specific elimination of infected cells, potentially leading to HBV-infection persistence, which promotes end-stage liver disease outcomes.<sep>Recently, we found that both HIV and acetaldehyde, an alcohol metabolite, induce hepatocyte apoptosis, resulting in the release of large extracellular vesicles called apoptotic bodies (ABs). The engulfment of these hepatocyte ABs by hepatic stellate cells (HSC) leads to their profibrotic activation. This study aims to establish the mechanisms of HSC activation after engulfment of ABs from acetaldehyde and HIV-exposed hepatocytes (ABAGS+HIV). In vitro experiments were performed on Huh7.5-CYP (RLW) cells to generate hepatocyte ABs and LX2 cells were used as HSC. To generate ABs, RLW cells were pretreated for 24 h with acetaldehyde, then exposed overnight to HIV1ADA and to acetaldehyde for 96 h. Thereafter, ABs were isolated from cell suspension by a differential centrifugation method and incubated with LX2 cells (3:1 ratio) for profibrotic genes and protein analyses. We found that HSC internalized ABs via the tyrosine kinase receptor, Axl. While the HIV gag RNA/HIV proteins accumulated in ABs elicited no productive infection in LX2 and immune cells, they triggered ROS and IL6 generation, which, in turn, activated profibrotic genes via the JNK-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT3 pathways. Similarly, ongoing profibrotic activation was observed in immunodeficient NSG mice fed ethanol and injected with HIV-derived RLW ABs. We conclude that HSC activation by hepatocyte ABAGS+HIV engulfment is mediated by ROS-dependent JNK-ERK1/2 and IL6 triggering of JAK-STAT3 pathways. This can partially explain the mechanisms of liver fibrosis development frequently observed among alcohol abusing PLWH.<sep>The use of immunodeficient mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells is an accepted approach to study human-specific infectious diseases such as HIV-1 and to investigate multiple aspects of human immune system development. However, mouse and human are different in sialylation patterns of proteins due to evolutionary mutations of the CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene that prevent formation of N-glycolylneuraminic acid from N-acetylneuraminic acid. How changes in the mouse glycoproteins' chemistry affect phenotype and function of transplanted human hematopoietic stem cells and mature human immune cells in the course of HIV-1 infection are not known.We mutated mouse CMAH in the NOD/scid-IL2Rγc-/- (NSG) mouse strain, which is widely used for the transplantation of human cells, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The new strain provides a better environment for human immune cells. Transplantation of human hematopoietic stem cells leads to broad B cells repertoire, higher sensitivity to HIV-1 infection, and enhanced proliferation of transplanted peripheral blood lymphocytes. The mice showed no effect on the clearance of human immunoglobulins and enhanced transduction efficiency of recombinant adeno-associated viral vector rAAV2/DJ8.NSG-cmah-/- mice expand the mouse models suitable for human cells transplantation, and this new model has advantages in generating a human B cell repertoire. This strain is suitable to study different aspects of the human immune system development, provide advantages in patient-derived tissue and cell transplantation, and could allow studies of viral vectors and infectious agents that are sensitive to human-like sialylation of mouse glycoproteins.<sep>The morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection is often associated with liver disease, which progresses slowly into severe liver dysfunction. There are multiple insults which exacerbate HIV-related liver injury, including HIV-associated dysregulation of lipid metabolism and fat turnover, co-infections with hepatotropic viruses and alcohol abuse. As we reported before, exposure of hepatocytes to HIV and alcohol metabolites causes high oxidative stress, impairs proteasomal and lysosomal functions leading to accumulation of HIV in these cells, which end-ups with apoptotic cell death and finally promotes development of liver fibrosis.To study whether obeticholic acid (OCA) prevents HIV/ethanol metabolism-induced hepatotoxicity and subsequent activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) by HIV+ apoptotic hepatocyte engulfment.Huh7.5-CYP (RLW) cells were exposed to HIV and acetaldehyde-generating system (AGS) in the presence or absence of OCA. In the cells, we measured the expression of HIV-related markers: HIVgagRNA-by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), p24- by western blot, HIV DNA-by semi-nested PCR, integrated HIV DNA-by ddPCR. Lysosomal and proteasomal activities were measured using fluorometrically-labeled substrates. For hepatocyte apoptosis, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP were visualized by western blot and cytokeratin 18- by M30 ELISA-in supernatants. Apoptotic bodies were generated from untreated and HIV-treated RLW cells exposed to UV light. Pro-fibrotic activation of HSC was characterized by Col1A1 and transforming growth factor-β mRNAs, while inflammasome activation- by NLRP3, caspase 1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β mRNA levels.In RLW cells, OCA treatment attenuated HIV-AGS-induced accumulation of HIVgagRNA, HIV DNA and p24. OCA suppressed reactive oxygen species production and restored chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity as well as cathepsin B lysosome activity. OCA also decreased HIV-AGS-triggered apoptosis in RLW cells. Exposure of HIV-containing apoptotic hepatocytes to HSC prevented activation of inflammasome and induced pro-fibrotic activation in these cells.We conclude that by suppressing oxidative stress and restoring proteasomal and lysosomal functions impaired by HIV and ethanol metabolism, OCA decreases accumulation of HIV in hepatocytes, leading to down-regulation of apoptosis in these cells. In addition, OCA reverses pro-fibrotic and inflammasome-related activation of HSC triggered by engulfment of HIV-containing apoptotic hepatocytes, potentially contributing to suppression of liver fibrosis development.</abstract>", "<keyword>X chromosome<sep>Real-time polymerase chain reaction<sep>Sexual dimorphism<sep>Dosage compensation<sep>Diurnal temperature variation<sep>Regulation of gene expression<sep>Normalization (sociology)<sep>Housekeeping gene<sep>Cichlid<sep>Rhodopsin<sep>Genome<sep>Transposable element<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Estimator<sep>Population<sep>Structural variation<sep>Chromosome<sep>Locus (genetics)<sep>Wright<sep>Foraging<sep>Opsin<sep>Gene expression<sep>Confusion<sep>Gene</keyword><title>Disagreement in <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> estimators: A case study from sex chromosomes<sep>Sex-Biased Gene Expression and Dosage Compensation on the<i>Artemia franciscana</i>Z-Chromosome<sep><i>Tbx2a</i>modulates switching of opsin gene expression<sep><i>Tbx2a</i>Modulates Switching of<i>RH2</i>and<i>LWS</i>Opsin Gene Expression<sep>Chromosome-scale assemblies reveal the structural evolution of African cichlid genomes<sep>Diurnal variation in opsin expression and common housekeeping genes necessitates comprehensive normalization methods for quantitative real‐time PCR analyses</title><abstract>Abstract Sewall Wright developed F ST for describing population differentiation and it has since been extended to many novel applications, including the detection of homomorphic sex chromosomes. However, there has been confusion regarding the expected estimate of F ST for a fixed difference between the X‐ and Y‐chromosome when comparing males and females. Here, we attempt to resolve this confusion by contrasting two common F ST estimators and explain why they yield different estimates when applied to the case of sex chromosomes. We show that this difference is true for many allele frequencies, but the situation characterized by fixed differences between the X‐ and Y‐chromosome is among the most extreme. To avoid additional confusion, we recommend that all authors using F ST clearly state which estimator of F ST their work uses.<sep>Males and females of Artemia franciscana, a crustacean commonly used in the aquarium trade, are highly dimorphic. Sex is determined by a pair of ZW chromosomes, but the nature and extent of differentiation of these chromosomes is unknown. Here, we characterize the Z chromosome by detecting genomic regions that show lower genomic coverage in female than in male samples, and regions that harbor an excess of female-specific SNPs. We detect many Z-specific genes, which no longer have homologs on the W, but also Z-linked genes that appear to have diverged very recently from their existing W-linked homolog. We assess patterns of male and female expression in two tissues with extensive morphological dimorphism, gonads, and heads. In agreement with their morphology, sex-biased expression is common in both tissues. Interestingly, the Z chromosome is not enriched for sex-biased genes, and seems to in fact have a mechanism of dosage compensation that leads to equal expression in males and in females. Both of these patterns are contrary to most ZW systems studied so far, making A. franciscana an excellent model for investigating the interplay between the evolution of sexual dimorphism and dosage compensation, as well as Z chromosome evolution in general.<sep>ABSTRACT Differences in sensory tuning are reported to maintain species boundaries and may even lead to speciation. Variation in the tuning of color vision is likely due to differences in the expression of opsin genes. Over 1,000 species of African cichlid fishes provide an excellent model system for studying the genetic basis of opsin gene expression because of the presence of seven distinct genes, yet individual species typically express only a divergent set of three opsins. The evolution of such shifts is expected to arise through either (a) two simultaneous regulatory changes (one for each opsin), or (b) one regulatory change that simultaneously promotes expression of one opsin while repressing another. Here, we used QTL analyses, genome sequencing, and gene expression studies to identify the transcription factor Tbx2a as likely driving a switch between LWS and RH2 opsin expression. Binding sites for Tbx2a in the LWS promoter and the highly conserved Locus Control Region of RH2 act to concurrently promote LWS expression while repressing RH2 expression. Our data support the hypothesis that instant changes in visual tuning can be achieved by switching the expression of multiple genes by a single mutation and do not require independent changes in the regulatory regions of each opsin.<sep>Abstract Sensory systems are tuned by selection to maximize organismal fitness in particular environments. This tuning has implications for intraspecies communication, the maintenance of species boundaries, and speciation. Tuning of color vision largely depends on the sequence of the expressed opsin proteins. To improve tuning of visual sensitivities to shifts in habitat or foraging ecology over the course of development, many organisms change which opsins are expressed. Changes in this developmental sequence (heterochronic shifts) can create differences in visual sensitivity among closely related species. The genetic mechanisms by which these developmental shifts occur are poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative trait locus analyses, genome sequencing, and gene expression studies in African cichlid fishes to identify a role for the transcription factor Tbx2a in driving a switch between long wavelength sensitive (LWS) and Rhodopsin-like (RH2) opsin expression. We identify binding sites for Tbx2a in the LWS promoter and the highly conserved locus control region of RH2 which concurrently promote LWS expression while repressing RH2 expression. We also present evidence that a single change in Tbx2a regulatory sequence has led to a species difference in visual tuning, providing the first mechanistic model for the evolution of rapid switches in sensory tuning. This difference in visual tuning likely has important roles in evolution as it corresponds to differences in diet, microhabitat choice, and male nuptial coloration.<sep>African cichlid fishes are well known for their rapid radiations and are a model system for studying evolutionary processes. Here we compare multiple, high-quality, chromosome-scale genome assemblies to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying cichlid diversification and study how genome structure evolves in rapidly radiating lineages. We re-anchored our recent assembly of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) genome using a new high-density genetic map. We also developed a new de novo genome assembly of the Lake Malawi cichlid, Metriaclima zebra, using high-coverage Pacific Biosciences sequencing, and anchored contigs to linkage groups (LGs) using 4 different genetic maps. These new anchored assemblies allow the first chromosome-scale comparisons of African cichlid genomes. Large intra-chromosomal structural differences (∼2–28 megabase pairs) among species are common, while inter-chromosomal differences are rare (<10 megabase pairs total). Placement of the centromeres within the chromosome-scale assemblies identifies large structural differences that explain many of the karyotype differences among species. Structural differences are also associated with unique patterns of recombination on sex chromosomes. Structural differences on LG9, LG11, and LG20 are associated with reduced recombination, indicative of inversions between the rock- and sand-dwelling clades of Lake Malawi cichlids. M. zebra has a larger number of recent transposable element insertions compared with O. niloticus, suggesting that several transposable element families have a higher rate of insertion in the haplochromine cichlid lineage. This study identifies novel structural variation among East African cichlid genomes and provides a new set of genomic resources to support research on the mechanisms driving cichlid adaptation and speciation.<sep>Abstract To determine the visual sensitivities of an organism of interest, quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) is often used to quantify expression of the light‐sensitive opsins in the retina. While qRT–PCR is an affordable, high‐throughput method for measuring expression, it comes with inherent normalization issues that affect the interpretation of results, especially as opsin expression can vary greatly based on developmental stage, light environment or diurnal cycles. We tested for diurnal cycles of opsin expression over a period of 24 hr at 1‐hr increments and examined how normalization affects a data set with fluctuating expression levels using qRT–PCR and transcriptome data from the retinae of the cichlid Pelmatolapia mariae . We compared five methods of normalizing opsin expression relative to (a) the average of three stably expressed housekeeping genes ( Ube2z , EF1‐α and β‐actin ), (b) total RNA concentration, (c) GNAT2 , (the cone‐specific subunit of transducin), (d) total opsin expression and (e) only opsins expressed in the same cone type. Normalizing by proportion of cone type produced the least variation and would be best for removing time‐of‐day variation. In contrast, normalizing by housekeeping genes produced the highest daily variation in expression and demonstrated that the peak of cone opsin expression was in the late afternoon. A weighted correlation network analysis showed that the expression of different cone opsins follows a very similar daily cycle. With the knowledge of how these normalization methods affect opsin expression data, we make recommendations for designing sampling approaches and quantification methods based upon the scientific question being examined.</abstract>", "<keyword>Public transport<sep>Citizen journalism<sep>Prosperity<sep>Variable (mathematics)<sep>TRIPS architecture<sep>Control (management)<sep>Stakeholder<sep>Exploratory research<sep>Debriefing<sep>Grounded theory<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>Fleet management<sep>Perception<sep>Environmentally friendly<sep>Task (project management)<sep>Ethos<sep>Sustainability<sep>Interview<sep>Ex-ante<sep>Sharing economy<sep>Equity (law)<sep>Interpersonal communication<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Preference<sep>Enthusiasm<sep>Emerging technologies<sep>Truck<sep>Futures contract<sep>City centre<sep>Variables<sep>SAFER<sep>Platoon<sep>Distribution (mathematics)<sep>Greenhouse gas<sep>Futures studies<sep>Externality<sep>Scenario planning<sep>Consolidation (business)<sep>Willingness to pay<sep>Supply chain<sep>Mode (computer interface)<sep>DOCK<sep>Chronesthesia<sep>Taxis<sep>Test (biology)<sep>Stakeholder engagement<sep>Automation<sep>Multimodal transport<sep>Production (economics)<sep>City logistics</keyword><title>New Technology and Automation in Freight Transport and Handling Systems<sep>New technologies and autonomous vehicles for urban goods distribution<sep>Exploring the Drivers and Barriers to Green Supply Chain Management Implementation: A study of Independent UK Restaurants<sep>Shaping Urban Freight Systems via a Participatory Approach to Inform Policy-Making<sep>A study of users’ preferences after a brief exposure in a Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV)<sep>Targeting Global Environmental Challenges by the Means of Novel Multimodal Transport: Concept of Operations<sep>The Five Attribute Performance Assessment (FAPA) model to evaluate the performance of an urban consolidation centre<sep>Foresight through developing shared mental models: the case of Triple Access Planning<sep>Autonomous vehicles: who will use them, and will they share?<sep>Decarbonising road freight: Is truck automation and platooning an opportunity?<sep>The potential for automation to transform urban deliveries: Drivers, barriers and policy priorities<sep>The social perspective on policy towards local shared autonomous vehicle services (LSAVS)<sep>Passenger comfort and trust on first-time use of a shared autonomous shuttle vehicle</title><abstract>This is an evidence review that examines the trends in manufacturing and global supply chains, looking at the international trade, technology and users, and how these may change between now and 2040. The review has been commissioned by the Government Office for Science within the Foresight project. The Foresight Future of Mobility project is run from within the UK Government Office for Science (GO-Science). The Foresight project was launched to try to understand the broad question What benefits/ opportunities could the transport system of the future provide and what are the implications for Government and society?<sep>New technologies and automated systems are emerging as possible strategies to maximise the efficiency of urban logistics, while reducing negative externalities due to deliveries in urban areas. However, despite the high potential and enthusiasm towards future innovative alternatives, there are substantial research gaps regarding their actual effectiveness in terms of safety and operational performance. Furthermore, a successful implementation in the short- to medium-term might be prevented by a series of barriers, such as the lack of policies, regulations, and public acceptance. This chapter presents a critical review of different technologies and case studies, including theoretical frameworks, trials, and worldwide applications, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of the use of new technologies and autonomous vehicles for urban goods distribution.<sep>This is an exploratory study into the drivers and barriers faced by independent restaurants when implementing green supply chain management (GSCM) practices. There is a limited evidence in the literature that attempts to explore GSCM implementation practices in the restaurant industry. The study follows a qualitative interviewing and grounded theory approach. Analysis of the results revealed that restaurants experience many of the same drivers and barriers identified in the existing literature with notable exceptions such as the drivers of company ethos and a media focus. Whereas the key barriers emerged from the study are logistics, skepticism, corporate lying and the owner’s financial responsibility. These findings could be indicators of the wider experience of the UK independent restaurant industry. The study contributes to the literature by offering an insight into how the previously unstudied experiences of UK independent restaurants are similar and different to that of the larger restaurant chains and SMEs in other industries.<sep>In the upcoming era of new technologies, a transport system is expected to be ‘more sustainable,’ ‘safer,’ and ‘more efficient.’ However, to what extent is this true? Based on the results of a series of stakeholder engagement workshops, the paper explores the vision of different stakeholders about urban freight of the future. A Participatory Approach was used to allow stakeholders to identify the problem and co-design a set of solutions. Potential impacts of innovative urban deliveries on economy, environment, and society were analysed. Methodology and results were then compared with those of a city stakeholder engagement workshop delivered in Newcastle upon-Tyne in 2014. Stakeholders considered that an “engaging” and “easy to use” process was needed to facilitate the process and it encouraged participants to find solutions for a ‘common good.’ The participatory approach proposed in this process would support transport planners and policy-makers to design and implement a consistent policy framework for future sustainable urban freight systems.<sep>Shared Autonomous Vehicles are expected to significantly change transport and mobility, improving road safety, environmental impact and traffic efficiency. However, the successful implementation of a SAV mobility service strongly depends on public acceptance and adoption, which might be influenced by a number of factors, such as socio-demographic characteristics of potential users, and their expectations and perceptions towards the autonomous system. This study presents the results of a novel experiment carried out in a non-simulated environment, to explore car users’ preferences towards autonomous mobility options. Participants took part in a stated preference task before and after a brief exposure in a Shared Autonomous Vehicle. Interestingly, results show that the experience influenced people’s mode choice preferences, moving from car (the most preferred mode before the experiment) to autonomous taxi and shared autonomous taxi (after the experiment). The study and the results of the structural equation and the choice model also highlighted the importance of comfort in people’s preferences towards shared autonomous options.<sep>Novel modes of transport form the basis of environmentally friendly and economically efficient transport system of the future. This paper introduces the feasibility study of a Dock to Dock (D2D) use case, combining aspects of route development and infrastructure definition, for the transport of goods in South West England and South Wales. The proposed system makes use of new, more flexible and environmentally friendly means of transport, such as electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft and electric Autonomous ZeroEmission (eAZE) vessels. To meet the environmental targets set out for the transport sector, the use of alternative hydrogen- based fuels is investigated for air, surface and marine vehicles. Logistics, regulations and infrastructure required for the safe and efficient production and distribution of such low-emission energy vectors is also considered. Digital twin of the system is proposed to study its safety and viability, while the analysis of energy requirements is proposed to inform policy makers and define the necessary infrastructure to meet future emission-free transport energy needs.<sep>Nowadays, local authorities are not completely aware of the advantages of city logistics measures, as they usually do not have a quantitative estimation of their related benefits. One of the most popular city logistics schemes is probably the Urban Consolidation Centre, which aims to reduce the number of freight movements in urban areas through consolidation of goods and optimisation of deliveries. Due to its potential to reduce the negative impact of urban freight transport, the consolidation centre has been widely supported by local, national, and European authorities. However, there is a lack of performance evaluation (ex-post analysis) and little research on methods and tools to evaluate and quantify the actual benefits. This research work proposes a model based on a set of indicators that allow assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of an Urban Consolidation Centre in terms of costs, time, quality, productivity, and environmental sustainability. Ex-ante and ex-post evaluations are performed through a case study approach to validate the model. Results show that the model is suitable to both applications and can be customised to deliver tailored performance evaluations.<sep>Planning for the future involves making sense of the present and examining possible changes in key factors that can influence the future. Actors rely upon mental models of the system that planning addresses: their simplified interpretations of the makeup of system elements and element interactions that together determine how the system works. It follows that a helpful foundation for strong planning is to develop a shared mental model among actors of the system of interest in the present and use this in turn to create mental models of possible futures for the system (scenarios). This paper presents a methodology for doing this that incorporates co-creation of causal loop diagrams that turn inform development of scenarios. The paper then applies the methodology to offer more insight to the approach, using the case of the Triple Access System and in turn Triple Access Planning. Triple access refers to the transport, land-use and telecommunications systems which each provide different and inter-related means for being able to reach people, employment, goods, services and opportunities which underpins economic prosperity and social wellbeing. The paper highlights how thinking is an important and integral part of planning, especially when dealing with uncertainty in a complex system.<sep>The advent of road transport automation is suggested to be one of four key technological transitions that could amount to a major transformation in mobility practices. Specifically, fully Automated Vehicles (AVs) might replace the current private car owner user model with fleets of on-demand synchronously-shared automated taxis. However, significant barriers to this vision becoming the norm remain. This paper examines two critical user-acceptance aspects of the transition: willingness to adopt AVs, and willingness to share an AV with others, particularly strangers. Our novel survey (n = 899) included a choice experiment featuring four future full automation transport services (private, synchronously/asynchronously shared, and public). Cluster analysis examined respondents' preferences and their demographic and psycho-social characteristics. We uncover significant uncertainty about willingness to adopt automation and sharing, and important differences between clusters within our sample. For example, under 50% of participants report willingness to use an AV over their normal mode, or would prefer an automated option to a current human-driven option. Our findings raise critical questions for policymakers and transport authorities. Not least, how can AV technologies help realise the environmental and social benefits of widespread vehicle sharing in a context of a travelling public that still prefers its privacy on-the-move?<sep>Abstract Governments, industry and academia are paying high attention to autonomous vehicles and platooning, due to their high potential to transform public and private transport and reduce carbon emissions generated by road transport. The road freight sector is expected to be an early adopter of the autonomous technology due to the potential cost reduction for logistics companies. However, despite the expected fuel savings and polluting emission reductions due to truck platooning, actual benefits would strongly depend on the adopted technology and the operational conditions of the system. This paper investigates the potential for truck platooning to reduce carbon emissions from road freight, presenting a series of scenarios that vary by adoption rates, operational models and platoon size. Scenarios were co-designed with freight stakeholders to build a Truck Platooning Roadmap (2025–2050), considering a specific case study: the UK. Polluting emissions and related external costs are calculated across the different scenarios. Results show that there is high uncertainty for the adoption of truck platooning, with a potential first phase involving a small pool of low-automated trucks, and a second phase with a larger pool of high-automated trucks, reflecting higher economic and environmental benefits. A series of other technological and policy considerations are presented to support policymakers to draw a zero-carbon road freight strategy. Graphic abstract<sep>Urban freight transport is crucial to ensuring the economic vitality of a city. However, significant negative “externalities” arise from freight flows in urban areas. Current solutions to reduce the impact of freight transport in urban areas aim at reducing the number of vehicles (e.g., introducing traffic regulations and restrictions, or providing for transhipment to lower-environmental impact vehicles at an Urban Consolidation Centre), or to reduce the polluting emissions of the delivery fleet (e.g., use of electric vans, electric scooters, cargo-bikes). However, the future might offer very different additional options. Hence, the chapter explores developments in automation (i.e., autonomous surface and aerial delivery vehicles), such as might achieve sustainability benefits through replacing or integrating with current delivery systems, including providing the “last mile,” in urban areas. Specifically, the chapter presents a review of current and future developments in automated urban freight transport systems and the results of a series of stakeholder engagement workshops on future solutions for urban freight. The chapter demonstrates that, despite the potential importance of automation for improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the urban freight sector, research evidence gaps exist related to the identification of competitive advantages for these new technologies, micro and macro-economic benefits, and the costs of those developments. It is also considered that, while there may be potential for automation in the urban delivery sector to enhance welfare, particularly in terms of quality-of-life-factors, significant practical and policy barriers remain.<sep>The transport policy discourse posits Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) as a more sustainable solution for the implementation of road automation technology. A successful implementation of SAV services strongly depends on being able to meet user's needs, as well as responding to their expectations. For this reason, the public has a central role in the definition of appropriate and realistic policies for the design, regulation and adoption of new automated mobility services. However, whilst there has been considerable attention to individuals' attitudes towards road transport automation, few have applied participatory or co-design methods to help define new SAV services. Moreover, most of the existing studies have also been hypothetical rather than examining vehicles in real service settings. This paper addresses these imbalances through reporting a two-stage research initiative. Initially a local shared automated vehicle service (LSAVS) concept was examined in a co-design workshop (Stage 1), leading to the development of a conceptual framework for social acceptance. This was then applied (Stage 2) in qualitative empirical research into the experiences of participants who rode in two different live prototype LSAVS. It was found that social considerations such as equity in access to mobility services, social inclusion, environmental protection, and concerns about control over interpersonal interactions emerged as strong acceptance factors within participants' construction of the conceptual services and responses to exposure to actual services. However, broad socio-political aspirations beyond transport policy were also important. It is concluded that achieving high levels of social acceptance where these utopian expectations meet commercial realities and public-sector constraints will be a major policy challenge facing any attempt to introduce an LSAVS with strong sustainable mobility credentials.<sep>Autonomous Vehicles (AV) may become widely diffused as a road transport technology around the world. However, two conditions of successful adoption of AVs are that they must be synchronously shared, to avoid negative transport network and environmental consequences, and that high levels of public acceptance of the technology must exist. The implications of these two conditions are that travellers must accept sharing rides with unfamiliar others in Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV). Two factors that have been identified as being positive influencers of acceptance are comfort and trust. The present paper undertakes a novel examination as to how comfort and trust ratings are affected by specific attributes of the ride experience of travelling in a fully-automated real-world, shared vehicle. To this end, 55 participants experienced riding in an SAV shuttle under experimental conditions at a test facility. Each experimental run involved two unrelated participants, accompanied by a safety operative and a researcher, undertaking four trips in the SAV, during which two conditions were presented for each of the independent variables of ‘direction of face’ (forwards/backwards) and ‘maximum vehicle speed’ (8/16 km/h). Order of presentation was varied between pairs of participants. After each run, participants rated the dependent variables ‘trust’ and ‘comfort’ (the latter variable comprised by six comfort factors). Expected and evaluative ratings were also obtained during pre-experimental orientation and debriefing sessions. Statistically significant relationships (p < .001) were found between trust and each of the independent variables, but for neither variable in the case of perceived comfort. A strong correlation was found between comfort and trust, interpreted as indicating trust in the SAV as an important predictor of perceived comfort. The before and after-experiment ratings for both variables showed statistically significant increases, and particularly for daily car drivers.</abstract>", "<keyword>Missense mutation<sep>Coding (social sciences)<sep>Mutation<sep>Haploinsufficiency<sep>Concordance<sep>Pathogenicity<sep>Exome sequencing<sep>Exome<sep>Germline mutation<sep>Germline<sep>Autism<sep>Epilepsy<sep>Mendelian inheritance<sep>Variation (astronomy)<sep>MSH2<sep>DNA repair<sep>Phenotype<sep>Microcephaly<sep>Gene<sep>Intellectual disability</keyword><title>Germline de novo mutations in families with Mendelian cancer syndromes caused by defects in DNA repair<sep>The contribution of X-linked coding variation to severe developmental disorders<sep>Evidence for 28 genetic disorders discovered by combining healthcare and research data<sep>Quantifying prediction of pathogenicity for within-codon concordance (PM5) using 7541 functional classifications of BRCA1 and MSH2 missense variants<sep>Heterozygous Variants in KMT2E Cause a Spectrum of Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Epilepsy</title><abstract>Abstract DNA repair defects underlie many cancer syndromes. We tested whether de novo germline mutations (DNMs) are increased in families with germline defects in polymerase proofreading or base excision repair. A parent with a single germline POLE or POLD1 mutation, or biallelic MUTYH mutations, had 3-4 fold increased DNMs over sex-matched controls. POLE had the largest effect. The DNMs carried mutational signatures of the appropriate DNA repair deficiency. No DNM increase occurred in offspring of MUTYH heterozygous parents. Parental DNA repair defects caused about 20–150 DNMs per child, additional to the ~60 found in controls, but almost all extra DNMs occurred in non-coding regions. No increase in post-zygotic mutations was detected, excepting a child with bi-allelic MUTYH mutations who was excluded from the main analysis; she had received chemotherapy and may have undergone oligoclonal haematopoiesis. Inherited DNA repair defects associated with base pair-level mutations increase DNMs, but phenotypic consequences appear unlikely.<sep>Abstract Over 130 X-linked genes have been robustly associated with developmental disorders, and X-linked causes have been hypothesised to underlie the higher developmental disorder rates in males. Here, we evaluate the burden of X-linked coding variation in 11,044 developmental disorder patients, and find a similar rate of X-linked causes in males and females (6.0% and 6.9%, respectively), indicating that such variants do not account for the 1.4-fold male bias. We develop an improved strategy to detect X-linked developmental disorders and identify 23 significant genes, all of which were previously known, consistent with our inference that the vast majority of the X-linked burden is in known developmental disorder-associated genes. Importantly, we estimate that, in male probands, only 13% of inherited rare missense variants in known developmental disorder-associated genes are likely to be pathogenic. Our results demonstrate that statistical analysis of large datasets can refine our understanding of modes of inheritance for individual X-linked disorders.<sep>De novo mutations in protein-coding genes are a well-established cause of developmental disorders1. However, genes known to be associated with developmental disorders account for only a minority of the observed excess of such de novo mutations1,2. Here, to identify previously undescribed genes associated with developmental disorders, we integrate healthcare and research exome-sequence data from 31,058 parent-offspring trios of individuals with developmental disorders, and develop a simulation-based statistical test to identify gene-specific enrichment of de novo mutations. We identified 285 genes that were significantly associated with developmental disorders, including 28 that had not previously been robustly associated with developmental disorders. Although we detected more genes associated with developmental disorders, much of the excess of de novo mutations in protein-coding genes remains unaccounted for. Modelling suggests that more than 1,000 genes associated with developmental disorders have not yet been described, many of which are likely to be less penetrant than the currently known genes. Research access to clinical diagnostic datasets will be critical for completing the map of genes associated with developmental disorders.<sep>PurposeConditions and thresholds applied for evidence weighting of within-codon concordance (PM5) for pathogenicity vary widely between laboratories and expert groups. Because of the sparseness of available clinical classifications, there is little evidence for variation in practice.MethodsWe used as a truthset 7541 dichotomous functional classifications of BRCA1 and MSH2, spanning 311 codons of BRCA1 and 918 codons of MSH2, generated from large-scale functional assays that have been shown to correlate excellently with clinical classifications. We assessed PM5 at 5 stringencies with incorporation of 8 in silico tools. For each analysis, we quantified a positive likelihood ratio (pLR, true positive rate/false positive rate), the predictive value of PM5-lookup in ClinVar compared with the functional truthset.ResultspLR was 16.3 (10.6-24.9) for variants for which there was exactly 1 additional colocated deleterious variant on ClinVar, and the variant under examination was equally or more damaging when analyzed using BLOSUM62. pLR was 71.5 (37.8-135.3) for variants for which there were 2 or more colocated deleterious ClinVar variants, and the variant under examination was equally or more damaging than at least 1 colocated variant when analyzed using BLOSUM62.ConclusionThese analyses support the graded use of PM5, with potential to use it at higher evidence weighting where more stringent criteria are met.<sep>We delineate a KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder on the basis of 38 individuals in 36 families. This study includes 31 distinct heterozygous variants in KMT2E (28 ascertained from Matchmaker Exchange and three previously reported), and four individuals with chromosome 7q22.2-22.23 microdeletions encompassing KMT2E (one previously reported). Almost all variants occurred de novo, and most were truncating. Most affected individuals with protein-truncating variants presented with mild intellectual disability. One-quarter of individuals met criteria for autism. Additional common features include macrocephaly, hypotonia, functional gastrointestinal abnormalities, and a subtle facial gestalt. Epilepsy was present in about one-fifth of individuals with truncating variants and was responsive to treatment with anti-epileptic medications in almost all. More than 70% of the individuals were male, and expressivity was variable by sex; epilepsy was more common in females and autism more common in males. The four individuals with microdeletions encompassing KMT2E generally presented similarly to those with truncating variants, but the degree of developmental delay was greater. The group of four individuals with missense variants in KMT2E presented with the most severe developmental delays. Epilepsy was present in all individuals with missense variants, often manifesting as treatment-resistant infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Microcephaly was also common in this group. Haploinsufficiency versus gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects specific to these missense variants in KMT2E might explain this divergence in phenotype, but requires independent validation. Disruptive variants in KMT2E are an under-recognized cause of neurodevelopmental abnormalities.</abstract>"]}

To reveal the precise sequence of events during early brain development, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics and uncovered cell states and trajectories in human brains at 5 to 14 postconceptional weeks (pcw). We identified 12 major classes that are organized as ~600 distinct cell states, which map to precise spatial anatomical domains at 5 pcw. We described detailed differentiation trajectories of the human forebrain and midbrain and found a large number of region-specific glioblasts that mature into distinct pre-astrocytes and pre-oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Our findings reveal the establishment of cell types during the first trimester of human brain development.<sep>Abstract High-grade gliomas harboring H3 G34R/V mutations exclusively occur in the cerebral hemispheres of adolescents and young adults, suggesting a distinct neurodevelopmental origin. Combining multimodal bulk and single-cell genomics with unbiased genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, we here describe a GABAergic interneuron progenitor lineage as the most likely context from which these H3 G34R/V mutations drive gliomagenesis, conferring unique and tumor-selective gene targets essential for glioma cell survival, as validated genetically and pharmacologically. Phenotypically, we demonstrate that while H3 G34R/V glioma cells harbor the neurotransmitter GABA, they are developmentally stalled, and do not induce the neuronal hyperexcitability described in other glioma subtypes. These findings offer a striking counter-example to the prevailing view of glioma origins in glial precursor cells, resulting in distinct cellular, microenvironmental, and therapeutic consequences.<sep>The spatiotemporal regulation of cell fate specification in the human developing spinal cord remains largely unknown. In this study, by performing integrated analysis of single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, we used 16 prenatal human samples to create a comprehensive developmental cell atlas of the spinal cord during post-conceptional weeks 5-12. This revealed how the cell fate commitment of neural progenitor cells and their spatial positioning are spatiotemporally regulated by specific gene sets. We identified unique events in human spinal cord development relative to rodents, including earlier quiescence of active neural stem cells, differential regulation of cell differentiation and distinct spatiotemporal genetic regulation of cell fate choices. In addition, by integrating our atlas with pediatric ependymomas data, we identified specific molecular signatures and lineage-specific genes of cancer stem cells during progression. Thus, we delineate spatiotemporal genetic regulation of human spinal cord development and leverage these data to gain disease insight.<sep>Abstract The lung contains numerous specialized cell types with distinct roles in tissue function and integrity. To clarify the origins and mechanisms generating cell heterogeneity, we created a comprehensive topographic atlas of early human lung development. Here we report 83 cell states and several spatially resolved developmental trajectories and predict cell interactions within defined tissue niches. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatially resolved transcriptomics into a web-based, open platform for interactive exploration. We show distinct gene expression programmes, accompanying sequential events of cell differentiation and maturation of the secretory and neuroendocrine cell types in proximal epithelium. We define the origin of airway fibroblasts associated with airway smooth muscle in bronchovascular bundles and describe a trajectory of Schwann cell progenitors to intrinsic parasympathetic neurons controlling bronchoconstriction. Our atlas provides a rich resource for further research and a reference for defining deviations from homeostatic and repair mechanisms leading to pulmonary diseases.<sep>Summary The lung contains numerous specialized cell-types with distinct roles in tissue function and integrity. To clarify the origins and mechanisms generating cell heterogeneity, we created a first comprehensive topographic atlas of early human lung development. We report 83 cell states, several spatially-resolved developmental trajectories and predict cell interactions within defined tissue niches. We integrated scRNA-Seq and spatial transcriptomics into a web-based, open platform for interactive exploration. To illustrate the utility of our approach we show distinct states of secretory and neuroendocrine cells, largely overlapping with the programs activated either during lung fibrosis or small cell lung cancer progression. We define the origin of uncharacterized airway fibroblasts associated with airway smooth muscle in bronchovascular bundles, and describe a trajectory of Schwann cell progenitors to intrinsic parasympathetic neurons controlling bronchoconstriction.

However, the spatiotemporal regulation of cell fate specification in the human developing spinal cord remains largely unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics techniques have advanced the understanding of human organ development considerably. By performing integrated analysis of single-cell and spatial multi-omics methods, we created a comprehensive developmental cell atlas of the first trimester human spinal cord. Our data revealed that the cell fate commitment of neural progenitor cells and their spatial positioning are spatiotemporally regulated by specific gene sets. Beyond this resource, we unexpectedly discovered unique events in human spinal cord development compared to rodents, including earlier quiescence of active neural stem cells, different regulation of stem cell differentiation, and distinct spatiotemporal genetic regulations of cell fate choices. In addition, using our atlas we identified specific gene expression in cancer stem cells in ependymomas. Thus, we demonstrate spatiotemporal genetic regulation of human spinal cord development as well as its potential to understand novel disease mechanisms and to inspire new therapies.<sep>Recent development in inferring RNA velocity from single-cell RNA-seq opens up exciting new vista into developmental lineage and cellular dynamics. However, the estimated velocity only gives a snapshot of how the transcriptome instantaneously changes in individual cells, and it does not provide quantitative predictions and insights about the whole system. In this work, we develop RNA-ODE, a principled computational framework that extends RNA velocity to quantify systems level dynamics and improve single-cell data analysis. We model the gene expression dynamics by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based formalism. Given a snapshot of gene expression at one time, RNA-ODE is able to predict and extrapolate the expression trajectory of each cell by solving the dynamic equations. Systematic experiments on simulations and on new data from developing brain demonstrate that RNA-ODE substantially improves many aspects of standard single-cell analysis. By leveraging temporal dynamics, RNA-ODE more accurately estimates cell state lineage and pseudo-time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. It also infers gene regulatory networks and identifies influential genes whose expression changes can decide cell fate. We expect RNA-ODE to be a Swiss army knife that aids many facets of single-cell RNA-seq analysis.<sep>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and accessory proteases (TMPRSS2 and CTSL) are needed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cellular entry, and their expression may shed light on viral tropism and impact across the body. We assessed the cell-type-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL across 107 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies from different tissues. ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL are coexpressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways and alveoli, and in cells from other organs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission or pathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals. This revealed cell-type-specific associations of age, sex and smoking with expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL. Expression of entry factors increased with age and in males, including in airway secretory cells and alveolar type 2 cells. Expression programs shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues included genes that may mediate viral entry, key immune functions and epithelial-macrophage cross-talk, such as genes involved in the interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and complement pathways. Cell-type-specific expression patterns may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and our work highlights putative molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention.</abstract>", "<keyword>Streptococcus pneumoniae<sep>Macrophage activation syndrome<sep>Eosinophil<sep>Imprinting (psychology)<sep>Disease<sep>Sepsis<sep>Testosterone (patch)<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Encephalomyelitis<sep>Risk factor<sep>Phagocytosis<sep>Cytokine storm<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>Inflammation<sep>Immune dysregulation<sep>Brainstem<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Antibody<sep>Neonatal sepsis<sep>Immune system<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Pathogenesis<sep>Acute respiratory distress<sep>Persistence (discontinuity)<sep>Autoantibody<sep>Population<sep>Bifidobacterium<sep>Breastfeeding<sep>CD8<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Immunity<sep>Efferocytosis<sep>Kawasaki disease<sep>2019-20 coronavirus outbreak<sep>Superantigen</keyword><title>Immune system perturbations in patients with long COVID<sep>Systems-Level Immunomonitoring from Acute to Recovery Phase of Severe COVID-19<sep>Bifidobacteria-mediated immune system imprinting early in life<sep>Age-dependent differences in efferocytosis determine the outcome of opsonophagocytic protection from invasive pathogens<sep>The Immunology of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19<sep>Restrained memory CD8+ T cell responses favors viral persistence and elevated IgG responses in patients with severe Long COVID.<sep>Immune system perturbations in patients with severe long COVID<sep>Achieving symptom relief in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis by targeting the neuro-immune interface and optimizing disease tolerance<sep>Immune system adaptation during gender-affirming testosterone treatment<sep>Antisecretory factor in breastmilk is associated with reduced incidence of sepsis in preterm infants</title><abstract>Klein et al. report multimodal analyses of immune cells, proteins, and physiological parameters in patients with long COVID (LC). At the group level, LC subjects exhibited elevated antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, but also to herpes viruses, pointing to a general suppression of viral control mechanisms in LC.<sep>Severe disease of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by vigorous inflammatory responses in the lung, often with a sudden onset after 5-7 days of stable disease. Efforts to modulate this hyperinflammation and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome rely on the unraveling of the immune cell interactions and cytokines that drive such responses. Given that every patient is captured at different stages of infection, longitudinal monitoring of the immune response is critical and systems-level analyses are required to capture cellular interactions. Here, we report on a systems-level blood immunomonitoring study of 37 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and followed with up to 14 blood samples from acute to recovery phases of the disease. We describe an IFNγ-eosinophil axis activated before lung hyperinflammation and changes in cell-cell co-regulation during different stages of the disease. We also map an immune trajectory during recovery that is shared among patients with severe COVID-19.<sep>Immune-microbe interactions early in life influence the risk of allergies, asthma, and other inflammatory diseases. Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit the host's immune system. Such bacteria have co-evolved with humans but are now increasingly rare in modern societies. Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon β (IFNβ) was induced. Fecal water from EVC001-supplemented infants contains abundant indolelactate and B. infantis-derived indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 cells during polarization, providing a functional link between beneficial microbes and immunoregulation during the first months of life.<sep>In early life, susceptibility to invasive infection skews toward a small subset of microbes, whereas other pathogens associated with diseases later in life, including Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), are uncommon among neonates. To delineate mechanisms behind age-dependent susceptibility, we compared age-specific mouse models of invasive Spn infection. We show enhanced CD11b-dependent opsonophagocytosis by neonatal neutrophils improved protection against Spn during early life. The augmented function of neonatal neutrophils was mediated by higher CD11b surface expression at the population level due to dampened efferocytosis, which also resulted in more CD11bhi “aged” neutrophils in peripheral blood. Dampened efferocytosis during early life could be attributed to the lack of CD169+ macrophages in neonates and reduced systemic expressions of multiple efferocytic mediators, including MerTK. On experimentally impairing efferocytosis later in life, CD11bhi neutrophils increased and protection against Spn improved. Our findings reveal how age-dependent differences in efferocytosis determine infection outcome through the modulation of CD11b-driven opsonophagocytosis and immunity.<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction, and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines, and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV-2, and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, shares several features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this condition with respect to T cell subsets, interleukin (IL)-17A, and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests multiple autoantibodies that could be involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.<sep>During the COVID-19 pandemic it was widely described that certain individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 experience persistent disease signs and symptoms, Long COVID, which in some cases is very severe with life changing consequences. To maximize our chances of identifying the underpinnings of this illness, we have focused on 121 of the most severe cases from &gt;1000 patients screened in specialized clinics in Sweden and Belgium. We restricted this study to subjects with objective measures of organ damage or dysfunction, &gt;3 months following a verified, but mild- to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. By performing systems-level immunological testing and comparisons to controls fully convalescent following a similar mild/moderate COVID-19 episode, we identify elevated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 in severe Long COVID suggestive of chronic antigen stimulation. Persistent viral reservoirs have been proposed in Long COVID and using multiple orthogonal methods for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein in plasma we identify a subset of patients with detectable antigens, but with minimal overlap across assays, and no correlation to symptoms or immune measurements. Elevated serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 on the other hand were inversely correlated with clonally expanded memory CD8+ T cells, indicating that restrained clonal expansion enables viral persistence, chronic antigen exposure and elevated IgG responses, even if antigen-detection in blood is not universally possible.<sep>Abstract SARS-CoV-2 infections have different outcomes ranging from mild to severe acute infection as well as post-infectious multi-system inflammatory syndromes (MIS-C/A). Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID is another outcome, which is poorly understood and range from mild to very severe persistent organ dysfunction and damages. To maximize our chances of identifying underlying mechanisms of long COVID we focus on the most severe cases with objective measures of disease such as lung damages, microvascular and autonomic nerve dysfunction. We are testing the following hypotheses that I) long COVID is a super-antigen mediated disease, II) an autoimmune condition driven by pathogenic autoantibodies, and/or III) a disease caused by viral persistence. A cohort of over 100 long COVID patients, 24 recovered long COVID patients as well as 9 COVID convalescent controls have been recruited thus far and blood samples analyzed for plasma proteome (Olink assays), immune cell composition and phenotypes (mass cytometry), T-cell repertoire (scTCR-seq), innate cell activation (circulating nucleosomes), and auto-antibody analyses (Luminex arrays) in order to understand immune perturbations in severe long COVID patients. Unlike children with hyperinflammatory MIS-C, we have not found any evidence of superantigen-mediated T-cell activation in long COVID, but instead substantial clonal expansion of memory T cell clones with effector memory states and shared clonality across patients. Additionally, cytokine perturbations such as elevated levels of IL8 and elevated levels of circulating nucleosomes indicate persistent activation of neutrophils in severe long COVID.<sep>Abstract Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) previously also known as chronic fatigue syndrome is a heterogeneous, debilitating syndrome of unknown etiology responsible for long-lasting disability in millions of patients worldwide. The most well-known symptom of ME is post-exertional malaise, but many patients also experience autonomic dysregulation, cranial nerve dysfunction and signs of immune system activation. Many patients also report a sudden onset of disease following an infection. The brainstem is a suspected focal point in ME pathogenesis and patients with structural impairment to the brainstem often show ME-like symptoms. The brainstem is also where the vagus nerve originates, a critical neuro-immune interface and mediator of the inflammatory reflex which regulate systemic inflammation. Here, we report the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial using intranasal mechanical stimulation targeting nerve endings in the nasal cavity, likely from the trigeminal nerve, possibly activating additional centers in the brainstem of ME patients and correlating with a ∼30% reduction in overall symptom scores after 8 weeks of treatment. By performing longitudinal, systems-level monitoring of the blood immune system in these patients, we uncover signs of chronic immune activation in ME, as well as immunological correlates of improvement that center around gut-homing immune cells and reduced inflammation. The mechanisms of symptom relief remain to be determined, but transcriptional analyses suggest an upregulation of disease tolerance mechanisms. We believe that these results are suggestive of ME as a condition explained by a maladaptive disease tolerance response following infection.<sep>Biological sex impacts human immune responses, modulating susceptibility and severity to immune-related diseases. Females generally mount more robust immune responses than males, resulting in lower infection severity and greater autoimmunity incidence. Here, we addressed the contribution of testosterone to human immune function by analyzing a cohort of subjects undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment. We performed systems-level immunomonitoring through mass cytometry, scRNA and scATAC-Sequencing, and proteome profiling of blood samples at baseline and following 3 and 12 months of treatment. Testosterone treatment was associated with a low-grade inflammatory profile, evidenced by upregulation of proinflammatory plasma proteome (e.g., EN-RAGE, OSM, TNF), and induction of an inflammatory transcriptional program associated with NFkB signaling, and TNF signaling. Following testosterone treatment, higher NFkB activity was revealed in CD4 T, CD8 T, and NK cells in scATACseq analyses. Further, testosterone increased monocytic inflammatory responses upon bacterial stimulation in vitro. Although testosterone was associated with this inflammatory profile, it also exerted negative effects on antiviral immunity. Firstly, the percentage of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) decreased over transition, with pDC also displaying phenotypic changes associated with lower IFN responses. Secondly, bulk transcriptomics analyses show an overall reduction of IFNa responses. Thirdly, testosterone treatment led to reduced IFNa production upon PBMCs stimulation with a viral agonist. Our results show that testosterone has broad effects on the human immune system, and significantly modulates important players in antiviral immunity and inflammatory response. Identifying pathways involved in immune sexual dimorphism will help define novel targets for effective prevention and treatment of immune-mediated diseases.<sep>Antisecretory Factor (AF) is a protein present in breastmilk that regulates inflammatory processes. We aimed to investigate the level of AF in mothers' own milk (MOM) in relation to sepsis and other neonatal morbidities in preterm infants.Samples of breastmilk and infant plasma were collected at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after birth from 38 mothers and their 49 infants born before 30 weeks gestation. AF-compleasome in MOM was determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and inflammatory markers in infant plasma by a panel of 92 inflammatory proteins. Neonatal treatments and outcomes were recorded.The level of AF in MOM week 1 was lower for infants with later sepsis compared to no sepsis (p = 0.005). Corrected for nutritional intake of MOM, higher levels of AF decreased the risk for sepsis, OR 0.24. AF in MOM week 1 was negatively correlated to inflammatory proteins in infant plasma week 4, markedly IL-8, which was also associated with infant sepsis. Overall, higher AF levels in MOM was associated with fewer major morbidities of prematurity.Mother's milk containing high levels of antisecretory factor is associated with reduced risk for sepsis and inflammation in preterm infants.High level of antisecretory factor (AF) in mothers' own milk is associated with less risk for later sepsis in preterm infants. Receiving mothers' milk with low AF levels during the first week after birth is correlated with more inflammatory proteins in infant's plasma 2-4 weeks later. Human breastmilk has anti-inflammatory properties, and antisecretory factor in mothers' own milk is a component of potential importance for infants born preterm. The findings suggest that food supplementation with AF to mothers of preterm infants to increase AF-levels in breastmilk may be a means to decrease the risk of inflammatory morbidities of prematurity.</abstract>", "<keyword>Recombinant DNA<sep>PKM2<sep>Creatinine<sep>Gene knockdown<sep>Trypsin<sep>Multiple myeloma<sep>Compendium<sep>Western blot<sep>Exon<sep>Gene isoform<sep>Detection limit<sep>HEK 293 cells<sep>Human genome<sep>Mass spectrometry<sep>Cancer<sep>Alternative splicing<sep>RNA splicing<sep>Biomarker discovery<sep>Protease<sep>Fenofibrate<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>Transfection<sep>Proteases<sep>Quantitative proteomics<sep>Clinical trial<sep>RuBisCO<sep>Cupriavidus necator<sep>Chaotropic agent<sep>Proteomics<sep>Endoplasmic reticulum<sep>Duchenne muscular dystrophy<sep>Erythropoietin<sep>Chinese hamster ovary cell<sep>Kidney disease<sep>Multiplex<sep>Peptide<sep>Pyruvate kinase<sep>Human Protein Atlas<sep>Enzyme<sep>Bacteria<sep>Downregulation and upregulation<sep>Human blood<sep>Apolipoprotein B<sep>Proteome<sep>Analyte<sep>Embryonic stem cell<sep>Assimilation (phonology)<sep>Lipoprotein<sep>Biomarker<sep>Selected reaction monitoring<sep>Gene<sep>Urine<sep>Albuminuria</keyword><title>A genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of protein-coding genes in human blood cells<sep>Targeted proteomics analysis of plasma proteins using recombinant protein standards for addition only workflows<sep>Addressing the Protease Bias in Quantitative Proteomics<sep>Discovery of Functional Alternatively Spliced &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt; Transcripts in Human Cancers<sep>Enhanced metabolism and negative regulation of ER stress support higher erythropoietin production in HEK293 cells<sep>Protein allocation and utilization in the versatile chemolithoautotroph Cupriavidus necator<sep>Absolute Quantification of Pan-Cancer Plasma Proteomes Reveals Unique Signature in Multiple Myeloma<sep>Discovery of functional alternatively spliced<i>PKM</i>transcripts in human cancers<sep>Targeted proteomics using stable isotope labeled protein fragments enables precise and robust determination of total apolipoprotein(a) in human plasma<sep>Assessing the Role of Trypsin in Quantitative Plasma and Single-Cell Proteomics toward Clinical Application<sep>Assessing the role of trypsin in quantitative plasma- and single-cell proteomics towards clinical application<sep>Discovery of Functional Alternatively Spliced PKM Transcripts in Human Cancers<sep>Longitudinal Plasma Protein Profiling Using Targeted Proteomics and Recombinant Protein Standards<sep>Protein allocation and utilization in the versatile chemolithoautotroph <i>Cupriavidus necator</i><sep>Rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection using quantitative peptide enrichment LC-MS analysis<sep>High throughput generation of a resource of the human secretome in mammalian cells<sep>Patient-Centric Quantitative Microsampling for Accurate Determination of Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (UACR) in a Clinical Setting<sep>Absolute Quantification of Apolipoproteins Following Treatment with Omega-3 Carboxylic Acids and Fenofibrate Using a High Precision Stable Isotope-labeled Recombinant Protein Fragments Based SRM Assay<sep>Orthogonal proteomics methods warrants development of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy biomarkers<sep>Orthogonal proteomics methods warrant the development of Duchenne muscular dystrophy biomarkers</title><abstract>A blood cell protein-expression atlas Genome-wide analyses are increasingly providing resources for advances in basic and applied biomedical science. Uhlen et al. performed a global expression analysis of human blood cell types and integrated this data with data across all major human tissues and organs in the human protein atlas. This comprehensive compendium allows for classification of all human protein-coding genes with regard to their tissue- and cell-type distribution. Science , this issue p. eaax9198<sep>Targeted proteomics is an attractive approach for the analysis of blood proteins. Here, we describe a novel analytical platform based on isotope-labeled recombinant protein standards stored in a chaotropic agent and subsequently dried down to allow storage at ambient temperature. This enables a straightforward protocol suitable for robotic workstations. Plasma samples to be analyzed are simply added to the dried pellet followed by enzymatic treatment and mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we show that this approach can be used to precisely (coefficient of variation <10%) determine the absolute concentrations in human plasma of hundred clinically relevant protein targets, spanning four orders of magnitude, using simultaneous analysis of 292 peptides. The use of this next-generation analytical platform for high-throughput clinical proteome profiling is discussed.<sep>Protein quantification strategies using multiple proteases have been shown to deliver poor interprotease accuracy in label-free mass spectrometry experiments. By utilizing six different proteases with different cleavage sites, this study explores the protease bias and its effect on accuracy and precision by using recombinant protein standards. We established 557 SRM assays, using a recombinant protein standard resource, toward 10 proteins in human plasma and determined their concentration with multiple proteases. The quantified peptides of these plasma proteins spanned 3 orders of magnitude (0.02–70 μM). In total, 60 peptides were used for absolute quantification and the majority of the peptides showed high robustness. The retained reproducibility was achieved by quantifying plasma proteins using spiked stable isotope standard recombinant proteins in a targeted proteomics workflow.<sep>The association of pyruvate kinase muscle type (PKM) with survival of cancer patients is controversial. Here, we focus on different transcripts of PKM and investigate the association between their mRNA expression and the clinical survival of the patients in 25 different cancers. We find that the transcripts encoding PKM2, and three previously unstudied transcripts, namely ENS0389093, ENS0568883 and ENS0561609, exhibited opposite prognostic indications in different cancers. Moreover, we validate the prognostic effect of these transcripts in an independent kidney cancer cohort. Finally, we reveal that ENS0389093 and ENS0568883 possess pyruvate kinase enzymatic activity and could have functional roles in metabolism, cell invasion and hypoxia response in cancer cells. Our study provided a potential explanation to the controversial prognostic indication of PKM, and could invoke future studies focusing on revealing the biological and oncological role of these alternative spliced variants of PKM.<sep>Recombinant protein production can cause severe stress on cellular metabolism, resulting in limited titer and product quality. To investigate cellular and metabolic characteristics associated with these limitations, we compare HEK293 clones producing either erythropoietin (EPO) (secretory) or GFP (non-secretory) protein at different rates. Transcriptomic and functional analyses indicate significantly higher metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation in EPO producers compared with parental and GFP cells. In addition, ribosomal genes exhibit specific expression patterns depending on the recombinant protein and the production rate. In a clone displaying a dramatically increased EPO secretion, we detect higher gene expression related to negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including upregulation of ATF6B, which aids EPO production in a subset of clones by overexpression or small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown. Our results offer potential target pathways and genes for further development of the secretory power in mammalian cell factories.<sep>Bacteria must balance the different needs for substrate assimilation, growth functions, and resilience in order to thrive in their environment. Of all cellular macromolecules, the bacterial proteome is by far the most important resource and its size is limited. Here, we investigated how the highly versatile 'knallgas' bacterium Cupriavidus necator reallocates protein resources when grown on different limiting substrates and with different growth rates. We determined protein quantity by mass spectrometry and estimated enzyme utilization by resource balance analysis modeling. We found that C. necator invests a large fraction of its proteome in functions that are hardly utilized. Of the enzymes that are utilized, many are present in excess abundance. One prominent example is the strong expression of CBB cycle genes such as Rubisco during growth on fructose. Modeling and mutant competition experiments suggest that CO2-reassimilation through Rubisco does not provide a fitness benefit for heterotrophic growth, but is rather an investment in readiness for autotrophy.<sep>Mass spectrometry based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) has developed into a powerful quantitative tool with a variety of implications, including precision medicine. Combined with stable isotope recombinant protein standards, this strategy provides confident protein identification and precise quantification on an absolute scale. Here, we describe a comprehensive targeted proteomics approach to profile a pan-cancer cohort consisting of 1800 blood plasma samples representing 15 different cancer types. We successfully performed an absolute quantification of 253 proteins in multiplex. The assay had low intra-assay variability with a coefficient of variation below 20% (CV = 17.2%) for a total of 1013 peptides quantified across almost two thousand injections. This study identified a potential biomarker panel of seven protein targets for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma patients using differential expression analysis and machine learning. The combination of markers, including the complement C1 complex, JCHAIN, and CD5L, resulted in a prediction model with an AUC of 0.96 for the identification of multiple myeloma patients across various cancer patients. All these proteins are known to interact with immunoglobulins.<sep>ABSTRACT The association of pyruvate kinase muscle type ( PKM ) with survival of cancer patients is controversial. Here, we focus on different transcripts of PKM and investigate the association between their mRNA expression and the clinical survival of the patients in 25 different cancers. We find that the transcript encoding PKM2, and three other functional transcripts are prognostic in multiple cancers. Our integrative analysis shows that the functions of these four transcripts are highly conservative in different cancers. Next, we validate the prognostic effect of these transcripts in an independent kidney renal clear-cell carcinoma (KIRC) cohort and identify a prognostic signature which could distinguish high- and low-risk KIRC patients. Finally, we reveal the functional role of alternatively spliced PKM transcripts in KIRC, and discover the protein products of different transcripts of PKM . Our analysis demonstrated that alternatively spliced transcripts of not only PKM but also other genes should be considered in cancer studies, since it may enable the discovery and targeting of the right protein product for development of the efficient treatment strategies.<sep>Lipoprotein(a), also known as Lp(a), is an LDL-like particle composed of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) bound covalently to apolipoprotein B100. Plasma concentrations of Lp(a) are highly heritable and vary widely between individuals. Elevated plasma concentration of Lp(a) is considered as an independent, causal risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Targeted mass spectrometry (LC-SRM/MS) combined with stable isotope-labeled recombinant proteins provides robust and precise quantification of proteins in the blood, making LC-SRM/MS assays appealing for monitoring plasma proteins for clinical implications. This study presents a novel quantitative approach, based on proteotypic peptides, to determine the absolute concentration of apo(a) from two microliters of plasma and qualified according to guideline requirements for targeted proteomics assays. After optimization, assay parameters such as linearity, lower limits of quantification (LLOQ), intra-assay variability (CV: 4.7%) and inter-assay repeatability (CV: 7.8%) were determined and the LC-SRM/MS results were benchmarked against a commercially available immunoassay. In summary, the measurements of an apo(a) single copy specific peptide and a kringle 4 specific peptide allow for the determination of molar concentration and relative size of apo(a) in individuals.<sep>Mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomics is rapidly evolving and routinely applied in large-scale biomedical studies. Proteases are a central component of every bottom-up proteomics experiment, digesting proteins into peptides. Trypsin has been the most widely applied protease in proteomics due to its characteristics. With ever-larger cohort sizes and possible future clinical application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the technical impact of trypsin becomes increasingly relevant. To assess possible biases introduced by trypsin digestion, we evaluated the impact of eight commercially available trypsins in a variety of bottom-up proteomics experiments and across a range of protease concentrations and storage times. To investigate the universal impact of these technical attributes, we included bulk HeLa cell lysate, human plasma, and single HEK293 cells, which were analyzed over a range of selected reaction monitoring (SRM), data-independent acquisition (DIA), and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) instrument methods on three LC-MS instruments. The quantification methods employed encompassed both label-free approaches and absolute quantification utilizing spike-in heavy-labeled recombinant protein fragment standards. Based on this extensive data set, we report variations between commercial trypsins, their source, and their concentration. Furthermore, we provide suggestions on the handling of trypsin in large-scale studies.<sep>Abstract Mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomics is rapidly evolving and routinely applied in large biomedical studies.

However, the association of PKM expression and the survival outcome of patients with different cancers is controversial. We employed systems biology methods to reveal prognostic value and potential biological functions of PKM transcripts in different human cancers. Protein products of transcripts were shown and detected by western blot and mass spectrometry analysis. We focused on different transcripts of PKM and investigated the associations between their mRNA expression and the clinical survival of the patients in 25 different cancers. We find that the transcripts encoding PKM2 and three previously unstudied transcripts, namely ENST00000389093, ENST00000568883, and ENST00000561609, exhibited opposite prognostic indications in different cancers.

Here, a quantitative method based on targeted proteomics analysis of plasma proteins using isotope-labeled recombinant standards originating from the Human Protein Atlas project has been established. The standards were individually quantified prior to being employed in the final multiplex assay. The assays are mainly directed toward actively secreted proteins produced in the liver, but may also originate from other parts of the human body. This study included 21 proteins classified by the FDA as either drug targets or approved clinical protein biomarkers. We describe the use of this multiplex assay for profiling a well-defined human cohort with sample collection spanning over a one-year period. Samples were collected at four different time points, which allowed for a longitudinal analysis to assess the variable plasma proteome within individuals. Two assays toward APOA1 and APOB had available clinical data, and the two assays were benchmarked against each other. The clinical assay is based on antibodies and shows high correlation between the two orthogonal methods, suggesting that targeted proteomics with highly parallel, multiplex analysis is an attractive alternative to antibody-based protein assays.<sep>Summary Bacteria must balance the different needs for substrate assimilation, growth functions, and resilience in order to thrive in their environment.

Highlights A large fraction of the C. necator proteome is not utilized and not essential Highly utilized enzymes are more abundant and less variable Autotrophy related enzymes are largely underutilized Re-assimilation of CO 2 via the CBB cycle is unlikely to provide a fitness benefit<sep>Reliable, robust, large-scale molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for monitoring the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We have developed a scalable analytical approach to detect viral proteins based on peptide immuno-affinity enrichment combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This is a multiplexed strategy, based on targeted proteomics analysis and read-out by LC-MS, capable of precisely quantifying and confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) swab media from combined throat/nasopharynx/saliva samples. The results reveal that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 measured by LC-MS correlate well with their correspondingreal-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) read-out (r = 0.79). The analytical workflow shows similar turnaround times as regular RT-PCR instrumentation with a quantitative read-out of viral proteins corresponding to cycle thresholds (Ct) equivalents ranging from 21 to 34. Using RT-PCR as a reference, we demonstrate that the LC-MS-based method has 100% negative percent agreement (estimated specificity) and 95% positive percent agreement (estimated sensitivity) when analyzing clinical samples collected from asymptomatic individuals with a Ct within the limit of detection of the mass spectrometer (Ct ≤ 30). These results suggest that a scalable analytical method based on LC-MS has a place in future pandemic preparedness centers to complement current virus detection technologies.<sep>The proteins secreted by human tissues and blood cells, the secretome, are important both for the basic understanding of human biology and for identification of potential targets for future diagnosis and therapy. Here, a high-throughput mammalian cell factory is presented that was established to create a resource of recombinant full-length proteins covering the majority of those annotated as ‘secreted’ in humans. The full-length DNA sequences of each of the predicted secreted proteins were generated by gene synthesis, the constructs were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the recombinant proteins were produced, purified and analyzed. Almost 1,300 proteins were successfully generated and proteins predicted to be secreted into the blood were produced with a success rate of 65%, while the success rates for the other categories of secreted proteins were somewhat lower giving an overall one-pass success rate of ca. 58%. The proteins were used to generate targeted proteomics assays and several of the proteins were shown to be active in a phenotypic assay involving pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation. Many of the proteins that failed during production in CHO cells could be rescued in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells suggesting that a cell factory of human origin can be an attractive alternative for production in mammalian cells. In conclusion, a high-throughput protein production and purification system has been successfully established to create a unique resource of the human secretome.<sep>Developing and implementing new patient-centric strategies for drug trials lowers the barrier to participation for some patients by reducing the need to travel to research sites. In early chronic kidney disease (CKD) trials, albuminuria is the key measure for determining treatment effect prior to pivotal kidney outcome trials.To facilitate albuminuria sample collection outside of a clinical research site, we developed 2 quantitative microsampling methods to determine the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). Readout was performed by LC-MS/MS.For the Mitra device the within-batch precision (CV%) was 2.8% to 4.6% and the between-batch precision was 5.3% to 6.1%. Corresponding data for the Capitainer device were 4.0% to 8.6% and 6.7% to 9.0%, respectively. The storage stability at room temperature for 3 weeks was 98% to 103% for both devices. The recovery for the Mitra and Capitainer devices was 104% (SD 7.0%) and 95 (SD 7.4%), respectively. The inter-assay comparison of UACR assessment generated results that were indistinguishable regardless of microsampling technique. The accuracy based on LC-MS/MS vs analysis of neat urine using a clinical chemistry analyzer was assessed in a clinical setting, resulting in 102 ± 8.0% for the Mitra device and 95 ± 10.0% for the Capitainer device.Both UACR microsampling measurements exhibit excellent accuracy and precision compared to a clinical chemistry analyzer using neat urine. We applied our patient-centric sampling strategy to subjects with heart failure in a clinical setting. Precise UACR measurements using quantitative microsampling at home would be beneficial in clinical drug development for kidney therapies.<sep>Stable isotope-labeled standard (SIS) peptides are used as internal standards in targeted proteomics to provide robust protein quantification, which is required in clinical settings. However, SIS peptides are typically added post trypsin digestion and, as the digestion efficiency can vary significantly between peptides within a protein, the accuracy and precision of the assay may be compromised. These drawbacks can be remedied by a new class of internal standards introduced by the Human Protein Atlas project, which are based on SIS recombinant protein fragments called SIS PrESTs. SIS PrESTs are added initially to the sample and SIS peptides are released on trypsin digestion. The SIS PrEST technology is promising for absolute quantification of protein biomarkers but has not previously been evaluated in a clinical setting. An automated and scalable solid phase extraction workflow for desalting and enrichment of plasma digests was established enabling simultaneous preparation of up to 96 samples. Robust high-precision quantification of 13 apolipoproteins was achieved using a novel multiplex SIS PrEST-based LC-SRM/MS Tier 2 assay in non-depleted human plasma. The assay exhibited inter-day coefficients of variation between 1.5% and 14.5% (median = 3.5%) and was subsequently used to investigate the effects of omega-3 carboxylic acids (OM3-CA) and fenofibrate on these 13 apolipoproteins in human plasma samples from a randomized placebo-controlled trial, EFFECT I (NCT02354976). No significant changes were observed in the OM3-CA arm, whereas treatment with fenofibrate significantly increased apoAII and reduced apoB, apoCI, apoE and apoCIV levels. The reduction in apoCIV following fenofibrate treatment is a novel finding. The study demonstrates that SIS PrESTs can facilitate the generation of robust multiplexed biomarker Tier 2<sep>Abstract Background: Molecular components in blood, like proteins, are used as biomarkers to reveal or predict disease states, guide clinical interventions and aid development of therapies. While multiplexing proteomics methods promote discovery of such biomarkers, it is generally difficult to translate them to clinical use due to lack of substantial evidence regarding their reliability as quantifiable indicators of disease state or outcome. To overcome this challenge, a novel orthogonal strategy is developed and used to assess reliability of biomarkers and analytically corroborate already identified serum biomarkers for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a monogenic incurable disease characterized by progressive muscle damage currently lacking reliable and specific disease monitoring tools. Methods: Two technological platforms are used to detect and quantify the biomarkers in 72 longitudinally collected serum samples from DMD patients at 3 to 5 timepoints. Quantification of the biomarkers is achieved by detection of the same biomarker fragment either through interaction with validated antibodies in immuno-assays or through quantification of peptides by Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry assay (PRM-MS). Results: Out of ten previously identified biomarkers by immuno-based proteomics methods, five are confirmed using the mass spectrometry based method. Two biomarkers, carbonic anhydrase III and lactate dehydrogenase B, are quantified with two independent methods, sandwich immunoassays and PRM-MS, to a Pearson correlation of 0.92 and 0.946 respectively. The median concentration of CA3 and LDHB in DMD patients is elevated in comparison to healthy individuals to 35- and 3-fold, respectively. Levels of CA3 vary between 10.26 and 0.36 ng/ml in DMD patients whereas that of LDHB vary between 15.1 and 0.8 ng/ml.

Between 1977 and 1979, 1,200 Rhesus D-negative Irish women were exposed to HCV-contaminated anti-D immunoglobulin. Here, we investigate why some individuals appear to resist infection despite exposure (exposed seronegative [ESN]). We screen HCV-resistant and -susceptible donors for anti-HCV adaptive immune responses using ELISpots and VirScan to profile antibodies against all know human viruses. We perform standardized ex vivo whole blood stimulation (TruCulture) assays with antiviral ligands and assess antiviral responses using NanoString transcriptomics and Luminex proteomics. We describe an enhanced TLR3-type I interferon response in ESNs compared with seropositive women. We also identify increased inflammatory cytokine production in response to polyIC in ESNs compared with seropositive women. These enhanced responses may have contributed to innate immune protection against HCV infection in our cohort.<sep>Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tags have been intensively applied in biological detection and imaging in recent years. However, both applications often suffer from high Raman background signals from containers such as 96-well plates or autofluorescence signals from biological tissues. Here, we greatly mitigate the influence of these high background Raman or fluorescent signals in both biological detection and imaging using two multivariate curve resolution (MCR) methods including negative matrix factorization and classical least squares. The limit of detection is lowered by one order of magnitude after applying MCR methods to detect target SERS tags in a 96-well plate. Additionally, in a multiplexed cell imaging assay, both false-negative and false-positive results were eliminated with the aid of MCR methods. Accordingly, we suggest a wider application of MCR methods during both biological detection and imaging of SERS tags with high background signals.<sep>Severe disease of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by vigorous inflammatory responses in the lung, often with a sudden onset after 5-7 days of stable disease. Efforts to modulate this hyperinflammation and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome rely on the unraveling of the immune cell interactions and cytokines that drive such responses. Given that every patient is captured at different stages of infection, longitudinal monitoring of the immune response is critical and systems-level analyses are required to capture cellular interactions. Here, we report on a systems-level blood immunomonitoring study of 37 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and followed with up to 14 blood samples from acute to recovery phases of the disease. We describe an IFNγ-eosinophil axis activated before lung hyperinflammation and changes in cell-cell co-regulation during different stages of the disease. We also map an immune trajectory during recovery that is shared among patients with severe COVID-19.<sep>Immune-microbe interactions early in life influence the risk of allergies, asthma, and other inflammatory diseases. Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit the host's immune system. Such bacteria have co-evolved with humans but are now increasingly rare in modern societies. Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon β (IFNβ) was induced. Fecal water from EVC001-supplemented infants contains abundant indolelactate and B. infantis-derived indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 cells during polarization, providing a functional link between beneficial microbes and immunoregulation during the first months of life.<sep>Although many methods have been developed to explore the function of cells by clustering high-dimensional (HD) single-cell omics data, the inconspicuously differential expressions of biomarkers of proteins or genes across all cells disturb the cell cluster delineation and downstream analysis. Here, we introduce a hashing-based framework to improve the delineation of cell clusters, which is based on the hypothesis that one variable with no significant differences can be decomposed into more diversely latent variables to distinguish cells. By projecting the original data into a sparse HD space, fly and densefly hashing preprocessing retain the local structure of data, and improve the cluster delineation of existing clustering methods, such as PhenoGraph. Moreover, the analyses on mass cytometry dataset show that our hashing-based framework manages to unveil new hidden heterogeneities in cell clusters. The proposed framework promotes the utilization of cell biomarkers and enriches the biological findings by introducing more latent variables.<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction, and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines, and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV-2, and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, shares several features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this condition with respect to T cell subsets, interleukin (IL)-17A, and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests multiple autoantibodies that could be involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.<sep>Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging and biopsy has been advocated as an important technique to evaluate the metastatic status of regional lymph nodes and determine subsequent surgical procedure for many cancers, yet there is no reliable means to provide accurate and rapid diagnosis of metastatic SLN during surgery. Here we develop a new approach, named “Ratiometric Raman dual-nanotag strategy”, that using folic acid functionalized targeted and nontargeted gap-enhanced Raman tags (FA-GERTs and Nt-GERTs) to detect metastatic SLN based on Raman imaging combined with classical least square data processing methods. By using this strategy, with built-in self-calibration for signal correction, rather than absolute intensity-dependent signal readout, we realize the visualization and prompt intraoperative diagnosis of metastatic SLN with a high accuracy of 87.5 % when the cut-off value of ratio (FA-GERTs/Nt-GERTs) set at 1.255. This approach may outperform the existing histopathological assessment in diagnosing SLN metastasis and is promising for guiding surgical procedure in the future.<sep>Gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs) with built-in Raman molecules show excellent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance and great potential for biomedical applications. In this work, we add a silver (Ag) shell to gold (Au) single-shell GERTs ([email protected]@Au) to form Au-Ag hybrid multi-shell nanoparticles. It is found that this modification enhances the SERS performance of the NPs and that the thickness of the Ag shell is a key factor in determining the enhancement. Double-shell bimetallic GERTs with a Au core, Au shell and exterior 2 nm-thickness silver shell ([email protected]@[email protected]@Ag) show the best SERS performance and good photostability. Moreover, we utilize the double-shell bimetallic GERTs to develop a new kind of SERS-based lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), acheiving limit of detection as low as 0.7 mIU/mL (0.077 ng/mL). We demonstrated a simple way to fabricate sub-100 nm multi-shell bimetallic GERTs for use as SERS probes with strong Raman signals with potential for in vivo and in vitro application as bioimaging and biosensing probes.<sep>Fish nocardiosis is a chronic, systemic, granulomatous disease in aquaculture. Nocardia seriolae has been reported to be one of the main pathogenic bacteria of fish nocardiosis. There are few studies on the associated virulence factors and pathogenesis of N. seriolae. Alanine dehydrogenase (ALD), which may be a secreted protein, was discovered by analysis using bioinformatics methods throughout the whole genomic sequence of N. seriolae. Nevertheless, the roles of ALD and its homologs in the pathogenesis of N. seriolae are not demonstrated. In this study, the function of N. seriolae ALD (NsALD) was preliminarily investigated by gene cloning, host cell subcellular localization, secreted protein identification, and cell apoptosis detection. Identification of the extracellular products of N. seriolae via mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that NsALD is a secreted protein. In addition, subcellular localization of NsALD-GFP recombinant protein in fathead minnow (FHM) cells showed that the strong green fluorescence co-localized with the mitochondria. Moreover, apoptosis assays demonstrated that the overexpression of NsALD induces apoptosis in FHM cells. This study may lay the foundation for further exploration of the function of NsALD and facilitate further understanding of the pathogenic mechanism and the associated virulence factors of N. seriolae.<sep>Mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a critical cell profiling tool in acquiring multiparameter proteome data at the single-cell level. A major challenge in CyTOF analysis is sample-to-sample variance arising from the pipetting process, staining variation, and instrument sensitivity. To reduce such variations, cell barcoding strategies that enable the combination of individual samples prior to antibody staining and data acquisition on CyTOF are often utilized. The most prevalent barcoding strategy is based on a binary scheme that cross-examines the existence or nonexistence of certain mass signals; however, it is limited by low barcoding efficiency and high cost, especially for large sample size. Herein, we present a novel barcoding method for CyTOF application based on mass ratiometry. Different mass tags with specific fixed ratios are used to label CD45 antibody to achieve sample barcoding. The presented method exponentially increases the number of possible barcoded samples with the same amount of mass tags compared with conventional methods. It also reduces the overall time for the labeling process to 40 min and avoids the need for expensive commercial barcoding buffer reagents. Moreover, unlike the conventional barcoding process, this strategy does not pre-permeabilize cells before the barcoding procedure, which offers additional benefits in preserving surface biomarker signals.<sep>Abstract Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) etiopathogenesis highlights the contributions of overproduction of CD4 + T cells and loss of immune tolerance. However, the involvement of CD8 + T cells in SLE pathology and disease progression remains unclear. Here, the comprehensive immune cell dysregulation in total 263 clinical peripheral blood samples composed of active SLE (aSLE), remission SLE (rSLE) and healthy controls (HCs) is investigated via mass cytometry, flow cytometry and single‐cell RNA sequencing. This is observed that CD8 + CD27 + CXCR3 − T cells are increased in rSLE compare to aSLE. Meanwhile, the effector function of CD8 + CD27 + CXCR3 − T cells are overactive in aSLE compare to HCs and rSLE, and are positively associated with clinical SLE activity. In addition, the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is monitored to interleukin‐2 stimulation in aSLE and rSLE to construct dynamic network biomarker (DNB) model. It is demonstrated that DNB score‐related parameters can faithfully predict the remission of aSLE and the flares of rSLE. The abundance and functional dysregulation of CD8 + CD27 + CXCR3 − T cells can be potential biomarkers for SLE prognosis and concomitant diagnosis. The DNB score with accurate prediction to SLE disease progression can provide clinical treatment suggestions especially for drug dosage determination.<sep>During the COVID-19 pandemic it was widely described that certain individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 experience persistent disease signs and symptoms, Long COVID, which in some cases is very severe with life changing consequences. To maximize our chances of identifying the underpinnings of this illness, we have focused on 121 of the most severe cases from &gt;1000 patients screened in specialized clinics in Sweden and Belgium. We restricted this study to subjects with objective measures of organ damage or dysfunction, &gt;3 months following a verified, but mild- to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. By performing systems-level immunological testing and comparisons to controls fully convalescent following a similar mild/moderate COVID-19 episode, we identify elevated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 in severe Long COVID suggestive of chronic antigen stimulation. Persistent viral reservoirs have been proposed in Long COVID and using multiple orthogonal methods for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein in plasma we identify a subset of patients with detectable antigens, but with minimal overlap across assays, and no correlation to symptoms or immune measurements. Elevated serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 on the other hand were inversely correlated with clonally expanded memory CD8+ T cells, indicating that restrained clonal expansion enables viral persistence, chronic antigen exposure and elevated IgG responses, even if antigen-detection in blood is not universally possible.<sep>Colon cancer (CC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related mortality. Research over past decades have profoundly enhanced our understanding of immunotherapy, a major clinical accomplishment, and its potential role towards treating CC. However, studies investigating the expression of these immune checkpoints, such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is lacking. Here, high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) is used to investigate immune alterations and promising immunotherapeutic targets expression by PBMCs of CC patients. Results reveal that expression of EpCAM and PD-L1 on CD4+ T cells significantly increased in patients with CC, compared with age- and sex- matching healthy controls and patients with colonic polyps. These differences are also validated in an independent patient cohort using flow cytometry. Further analysis revealed that EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells are PD-L1+ CCR5+ CCR6+. Immunofluorescence staining results demonstrate that the increase of EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells is also observed in tumor tissues, rather than para-cancerous tissues. To ascertain the functional disorders of the identified cell subset, phosphorylated signaling protein levels are assessed using imaging mass cytometry. Increases in pp38 MAPK and pMAPKAPK2 are observable, indicating abnormal activation of pp38 MAPK-pMAPKAPK2 signaling pathway. Results in this study indicate that EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells may play a<sep>Abstract SARS-CoV-2 infections have different outcomes ranging from mild to severe acute infection as well as post-infectious multi-system inflammatory syndromes (MIS-C/A). Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID is another outcome, which is poorly understood and range from mild to very severe persistent organ dysfunction and damages. To maximize our chances of identifying underlying mechanisms of long COVID we focus on the most severe cases with objective measures of disease such as lung damages, microvascular and autonomic nerve dysfunction. We are testing the following hypotheses that I) long COVID is a super-antigen mediated disease, II) an autoimmune condition driven by pathogenic autoantibodies, and/or III) a disease caused by viral persistence. A cohort of over 100 long COVID patients, 24 recovered long COVID patients as well as 9 COVID convalescent controls have been recruited thus far and blood samples analyzed for plasma proteome (Olink assays), immune cell composition and phenotypes (mass cytometry), T-cell repertoire (scTCR-seq), innate cell activation (circulating nucleosomes), and auto-antibody analyses (Luminex arrays) in order to understand immune perturbations in severe long COVID patients. Unlike children with hyperinflammatory MIS-C, we have not found any evidence of superantigen-mediated T-cell activation in long COVID, but instead substantial clonal expansion of memory T cell clones with effector memory states and shared clonality across patients. Additionally, cytokine<sep>The aim of this study was to characterize clinical effects and biomarkers in three patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) caused by gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the STAT1 gene during treatment with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.Mass cytometry (CyTOF) was used to characterize mononuclear leukocyte populations and Olink assay to quantify 265 plasma proteins. Flow-cytometric Assay for Specific Cell-mediated Immune-response in Activated whole blood (FASCIA) was used to quantify the reactivity against Candida albicans.Overall, JAK inhibitors improved clinical symptoms of CMC, but caused side effects in two patients. Absolute numbers of neutrophils, T cells, B cells, and NK cells were sustained during baricitinib treatment. Detailed analysis of cellular subsets, using CyTOF, revealed increased expression of CD45, CD52, and CD99 in NK cells, reflecting a more functional phenotype. Conversely, monocytes and eosinophils downregulated CD16, consistent with reduced inflammation. Moreover, T and B cells showed increased expression of activation markers during treatment. In one patient with a remarkable clinical effect of baricitinib treatment, the immune response to C. albicans increased after 7 weeks of treatment. Alterations in plasma biomarkers involved downregulation of cellular markers CXCL10, annexin A1, granzyme B, granzyme H, and oncostatin M, whereas FGF21 was the only upregulated marker after 7 weeks. After 3 months, IFN-ɣ and CXCL10 were downregulated.The clinical effect of JAK inhibitor treatment<sep>Abstract Background Several autoimmune features occur during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), with possible implications for disease course, immunity, and autoimmune pathology. In this study, we longitudinally screened for clinically relevant systemic autoantibodies to assess their prevalence, temporal trajectory, and association with immunity, comorbidities, and severity of COVID‐19. Methods We performed highly sensitive indirect immunofluorescence assays to detect antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), along with serum proteomics and virome‐wide serological profiling in a multicentric cohort of 175 COVID‐19 patients followed up to 1 year after infection, eleven vaccinated individuals, and 41 unexposed controls. Results Compared with healthy controls, similar prevalence and patterns of ANA were present in patients during acute COVID‐19 and recovery. However, the paired analysis revealed a subgroup of patients with transient presence of certain ANA patterns during acute COVID‐19. Furthermore, patients with severe COVID‐19 exhibited a high prevalence of ANCA during acute disease. These autoantibodies were quantitatively associated with higher SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody titers in COVID‐19 patients and in vaccinated individuals, thus linking autoantibody production to increased antigen‐specific humoral responses. Notably, the qualitative breadth of antibodies cross‐reactive with other coronaviruses was comparable in ANA‐positive and ANA‐negative individuals during acute COVID‐19. In autoantibody‐positive patients, multiparametric characterization demonstrated an inflammatory signature during acute COVID‐19 and alterations of the B‐cell compartment after recovery.

Conclusion<sep>Biological sex impacts human immune responses, modulating susceptibility and severity to immune-related diseases. Females generally mount more robust immune responses than males, resulting in lower infection severity and greater autoimmunity incidence. Here, we addressed the contribution of testosterone to human immune function by analyzing a cohort of subjects undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment. We performed systems-level immunomonitoring through mass cytometry, scRNA and scATAC-Sequencing, and proteome profiling of blood samples at baseline and following 3 and 12 months of treatment. Testosterone treatment was associated with a low-grade inflammatory profile, evidenced by upregulation of proinflammatory plasma proteome (e.g., EN-RAGE, OSM, TNF), and induction of an inflammatory transcriptional program associated with NFkB signaling, and TNF signaling. Following testosterone treatment, higher NFkB activity was revealed in CD4 T, CD8 T, and NK cells in scATACseq analyses. Further, testosterone increased monocytic inflammatory responses upon bacterial stimulation in vitro. Although testosterone was associated with this inflammatory profile, it also exerted negative effects on antiviral immunity. Firstly, the percentage of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) decreased over transition, with pDC also displaying phenotypic changes associated with lower IFN responses. Secondly, bulk transcriptomics analyses show an overall reduction of IFNa responses. Thirdly, testosterone treatment led to reduced IFNa production upon PBMCs stimulation with a viral agonist. Our results show that testosterone has broad effects on<sep>Abstract Purpose : The aim of this study was to characterize biomarkers in three patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis caused by gain of function mutations in the STAT1 gene during treatment with Janus kinase inhibitors. Methods : We used mass cytometry to characterize mononuclear leukocyte populations and Olink assays to quantify 265 plasma proteins. Flow-cytometric Assay for Specific Cell-mediated Immune-response in Activated whole blood (FASCIA) was used to quantify the reactivity against Candida albicans . Results : While the number of B-, T- and NK-cells remained stable during baricitinib treatment, a detailed analysis revealed that CD4 + central memory T-cells increased during treatment from 25% to around 60% of the total numbers of CD4 + T-cells. In parallel, NK-cells showed an increased expression of CD45, CD52 and CD99, likely reflecting a more functional phenotype. Conversely, monocytes and eosinophils downregulated CD16, which is consistent with reduced inflammation. In the patient for which consecutive samples were available, the immune response to C. albicans was increased above the level found in normal individuals after 7 weeks of treatment. Early changes in plasma biomarkers involved downregulation of CXCL10, annexin A1, granzyme B, granzyme H and oncostatin M, whereas FGF21 was the only upregulated marker after 7 weeks. After 3 months, IFN-ɣ and CXCL10 were downregulated. Conclusions : Several biological<sep>Summary Immunoglobulins are among the most important anti-viral effectors of the human immune system. The biological mechanisms underlying antibody production and maintenance are relatively well understood. However, a broader model of how host intrinsic factors and external processes influence humoral responses to viral infections is lacking. Here, we investigate how age, sex, genetics, health-related habits, and immune factors relate to the anti-viral antibody repertoire of healthy humans. We used VirScan, a high-throughput technology based on phage-display immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq), to characterize antibody reactivity against more than 90,000 viral epitopes in 1,212 healthy adults of European and African descent. By comparing VirScan with various serological assays, we first show that PhIP-seq-based antibody repertoires recapitulate expected serostatuses and uncover considerable variation in epitope-specific reactivity. In addition to age and sex effects, we find that the antibody repertoire is strongly associated with active smoking, which results in increased antibody levels against rhinoviruses. We provide evidence that individuals born in Central Africa and Europe differ in antigenic reactivity to common herpesviruses by targeting different viral proteins. By comparing antibody repertoires to 169 immune cell parameters, we find that HLA-DR expression in circulating dendritic cells is associated with increased reactivity against EBV. Finally, we conducted a GWAS of antibody binding against more than 2,600 viral peptides.

Here, we systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.<sep>Cholesterol is highly abundant within all human body cells and modulates critical cellular functions related to cellular plasticity, metabolism, and survival. The cholesterol-binding toxin pneumolysin represents an essential virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae in establishing pneumonia and other pneumococcal infections. Thus, cholesterol scavenging of pneumolysin is a promising strategy to reduce S.&nbsp;pneumoniae induced lung damage. There may also be a second cholesterol-dependent mechanism whereby pneumococcal infection and the presence of pneumolysin increase hepatic sterol biosynthesis. Here we investigated a library of polymer particles varying in size and composition that allow for the cellular delivery of cholesterol and their effects on cell survival mechanisms following pneumolysin exposure. Intracellular delivery of cholesterol by nanocarriers composed of Eudragit E100-PLGA rescued pneumolysin-induced alterations of lipid homeostasis and enhanced cell survival irrespective of neutralization of pneumolysin.<sep>Many immunocompromised patients mount suboptimal humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Here, we assessed the single-cell profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells post-mRNA vaccination in healthy individuals and patients with various forms of immunodeficiencies. Impaired vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunity was observed in many immunocompromised patients, particularly in solid-organ transplant and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Notably, individuals with an inherited lack of mature B cells, i.e., X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) displayed highly functional spike-specific T cell responses. Single-cell RNA-sequencing further revealed that mRNA vaccination induced a broad functional spectrum of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in healthy individuals and patients with XLA. These responses were founded on polyclonal repertoires of CD4+ T cells and robust expansions of oligoclonal effector-memory CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells with stem-like characteristics. Collectively, our data provide the functional continuum of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses post-mRNA vaccination, highlighting that cell-mediated immunity is of variable functional quality across immunodeficiency syndromes.<sep>Necroptosis facilitates cell death in a controlled manner and is employed by many cell types following injury. It plays a significant role in various liver diseases, albeit the cell-type-specific regulation of necroptosis in the liver and especially hepatocytes, has not yet been conceptualized. We demonstrate that DNA methylation suppresses RIPK3 expression in human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. In diseases leading to cholestasis, the RIPK3 expression is induced in mice and humans in a cell-type-specific manner. Overexpression of RIPK3 in HepG2 cells leads to RIPK3 activation by phosphorylation and cell death, further modulated by different bile acids. Additionally, bile acids and RIPK3 activation further facilitate JNK phosphorylation, IL-8 expression, and its release. This suggests that hepatocytes suppress RIPK3 expression to protect themselves from necroptosis and cytokine release induced by bile acid and RIPK3. In chronic liver diseases associated with cholestasis, induction of RIPK3 expression may be an early event signaling danger and repair through releasing IL-8.<sep>Abstract Background &amp; Aims Necroptosis facilitates cell death in a controlled manner and is employed by many cell types following injury. It plays a major role in various liver diseases, albeit the cell type-specific regulation of necroptosis in the liver and especially hepatocytes has not yet been conceptualized. Approaches &amp; Results Here, we demonstrate that DNA methylation suppresses RIPK3 expression in human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. In diseases leading to cholestasis the RIPK3 expression is induced in mice and humans in a cell-type specific manner. Over-expression of RIPK3 in HepG2 cells leads immediately to RIPK3 activation by phosphorylation that is further modulated by different bile acids. Conclusion Bile acids mediated RIPK3 activation facilitates the secretion and expression of IL-8 via the JNK-pathway, suggesting hepatocytes suppress RIPK3 expression to protect themselves from bile acid induced necroptosis and inflammation but in chronical liver diseases associated with cholestasis induction of RIPK3 expression may be an early event signaling danger and repair through release of IL-8. Graphical abstract<sep>Severe COVID-19 is characterized by excessive inflammation of the lower airways. The balance of protective versus pathological immune responses in COVID-19 is incompletely understood. Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are antimicrobial T cells that recognize bacterial metabolites, and can also function as innate-like sensors and mediators of antiviral responses. Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in the circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses indicated significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69high and CXCR3low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and later release back into the circulation when disease is resolved. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their possible involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.<sep>Adaptive immune responses have been studied extensively in the course of mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. Considerably fewer studies have assessed the effects on innate immune cells. Here, we characterized NK cells in healthy individuals and immunocompromised patients in the course of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA prospective, open-label clinical vaccine trial. See trial registration description in notes. Results revealed preserved NK cell numbers, frequencies, subsets, phenotypes, and function as assessed through consecutive peripheral blood samplings at 0, 10, 21, and 35 days following vaccination. A positive correlation was observed between the frequency of NKG2C+ NK cells at baseline (Day 0) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab titers following BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination at Day 35. The present results provide basic insights in regards to NK cells in the context of mRNA vaccination, and have relevance for future mRNA-based vaccinations against COVID-19, other viral infections, and cancer.Trial registration: The current study is based on clinical material from the COVAXID open-label, non-randomized prospective clinical trial registered at EudraCT and clinicaltrials.gov (no. 2021-000175-37). Description: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04780659?term=2021-000175-37&draw=2&rank=1 .<sep>Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are unconventional T cells with innate-like capacity to rapidly respond to microbial infection via MR1-restricted antigen recognition. Emerging evidence indicate that they can also act as rapid sensors of viral infection via innate cytokine activation. However, their possible role in the immune response to mRNA vaccination is unknown. Here, we evaluated the involvement of MAIT cells in individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. MAIT cell levels, phenotype and function in circulation were preserved and unperturbed through day 35 post-vaccination in healthy donor (HD) vaccinees, as well as people living with HIV (PLWH) or with primary immunodeficiency (PID). Unexpectedly, pre-vaccination and post-vaccination levels of MAIT cells correlated positively with the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses in the HD vaccinees. This pattern was largely preserved in the PID group, but less so in the PLWH group. Furthermore, in the HD vaccinees levels of MAIT cell activation and cytolytic potential correlated negatively to the adaptive antigen-specific immune responses. These findings indicate an unexpected association between MAIT cell compartment characteristics and the immune response magnitude to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.<sep>Abstract Objectives Humoral and cellular immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 following COVID‐19 will likely contribute to protection from reinfection or severe disease. It is therefore important to characterise the initiation and persistence of adaptive immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 amidst the ongoing pandemic. Methods Here, we conducted a longitudinal study on hospitalised moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients from the acute phase of disease into convalescence at 5 and 9 months post‐symptom onset. Utilising flow cytometry, serological assays as well as B cell and T cell FluoroSpot assays, we assessed the magnitude and specificity of humoral and cellular immune responses during and after human SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results During acute COVID‐19, we observed an increase in germinal centre activity, a substantial expansion of antibody‐secreting cells and the generation of SARS‐CoV‐2‐neutralising antibodies. Despite gradually decreasing antibody levels, we show persistent, neutralising antibody titres as well as robust specific memory B cell responses and polyfunctional T cell responses at 5 and 9 months after symptom onset in both moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients. Conclusion Our findings describe the initiation and, importantly, persistence of cellular and humoral SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific immunological memory in hospitalised COVID‐19 patients long after recovery, likely contributing towards protection against reinfection.<sep>Abstract Severe COVID-19 is characterized by excessive inflammation of the lower airways. The balance of protective versus pathological immune responses in COVID-19 is incompletely understood. Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are antimicrobial T cells that recognize bacterial metabolites, and can also function as innate-like sensors and mediators of antiviral responses. Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation, as well as significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69 high and CXCR3 low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and subsequent release with disease resolution. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. One sentence summary MAIT cells are strongly activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in a manner associated with disease severity and outcome, they decline in blood, are enriched in the airways as a prominent IL-17A expressing subset, and dynamically recover in circulation during convalescence.<sep>Abstract Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant population of unconventional T cells in humans and play important roles in immune defense against microbial infections. Severe COVID-19 is associated with strong activation of MAIT cells and loss of these cells from circulation. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of MAIT cells to recover after severe COVID-19. In longitudinal paired analysis, MAIT cells initially rebounded numerically and phenotypically in most patients at 4 mo postrelease from the hospital. However, the rebounding MAIT cells displayed signs of persistent activation with elevated expression of CD69, CD38, and HLA-DR. Although MAIT cell function was restored in many patients, a subgroup displayed a predominantly PD-1high functionally impaired MAIT cell pool. This profile was associated with poor expression of IFN-γ and granzyme B in response to IL-12+IL-18 and low levels of polyfunctionality. Unexpectedly, although the overall T cell counts recovered, normalization of the MAIT cell pool failed at 9-mo follow-up, with a clear decline in MAIT cell numbers and a further increase in PD-1 levels. Together, these results indicate an initial transient period of inconsistent recovery of MAIT cells that is not sustained and eventually fails. Persisting MAIT cell impairment in previously hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may have consequences for antimicrobial immunity and inflammation and could potentially contribute to post-COVID-19 health problems.<sep>Abstract Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an evolutionarily conserved population of T cells serving a sentinel function at mucosal barrier sites to mediate immune protection. MAIT cells utilize their semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) to react to non-peptidic antigens derived from microbial riboflavin metabolites, presented on monomorphic MHC-class I-like MR1 molecules. In addition to TCR-dependent recognition of vitamin B2metabolites, MAIT cells sense and respond to local inflammatory cytokines in an innate-like manner. Surface expression of CD56 was previously shown to be associated with enhanced MAIT cell sensitivity to TCR-independent activation. However, the regulation, frequency, or relevance of CD56 expression on human MAIT cells is currently not well understood. Flow cytometry revealed heterogeneity of CD56 expression across donor-matched tissues obtained from human organ donors. Strikingly, the majority of liver MAIT cells expressed CD56, whereas expression was consistently lower in other tissues. We evaluated de novo CD56 expression on blood-derived sorted CD56-negative MAIT cells following IL-7 or antigen exposure which is likely to occur in the hepatic acute phase response. CD56-negative MAIT cells strongly upregulated CD56 expression after IL-7 stimulation and maintained CD56 expression for up to 19 days. Exposure to MR1-presented antigen induced CD56 expression similarly but required prior cell proliferation. In summary, we identify heterogeneity between MAIT cell populations of different tissue origin and determine the dynamic regulation of the CD56-associated innate-like characteristics to shed light on unknown aspects of MAIT cell diversity and immunobiology.<sep>A contactless label-free method using a diamagnetophoretic ink to rapidly print three-dimensional (3D) scaffold-free multicellular structures is described. The inks consist of MCF-7 cells that are suspended in a culture medium to which a paramagnetic salt, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium (III) dihydrogen salt hydrate (Gd-DTPA), is added. When a magnetic field is applied, the host fluid containing the paramagnetic salt is attracted towards regions of high magnetic field gradient, displacing the ink towards regions with a low gradient. Using this method, 3D structures are printed on ultra-low attachment (ULA) surfaces. On a tissue culture treated (TCT) surface, a 3D printed spheroid coexists with a two-dimensional (2D) cell monolayer, where the composite is termed as a 2.5D structure. The 3D structures can be magnetically printed within 6 hours in a medium containing 25 mM Gd-DTPA. The influence of the paramagnetic salt on MCF-7 cell viability, cell morphology, and ability of cells to adhere to each other to stabilize the printed structures on both ULA and TCT surfaces is investigated. Gene expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha ( HIF1 α ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) allow comparison of the relative stresses for the printed 3D and 2.5D cell geometries with those for 3D spheroids formed without magnetic assistance. This magnetic printing method can be potentially scaled to a higher throughput to rapidly print cells into 3D heterogeneous cell structures with variable geometries with repeatable dimensions for applications such as tissue engineering and tumour formation for drug discovery.</abstract>", "<keyword>Profiling (computer programming)<sep>Kernel (algebra)<sep>PTEN<sep>Workflow<sep>Tropism<sep>Probabilistic logic<sep>Fidelity<sep>Spatial ecology<sep>Image (mathematics)<sep>RNA<sep>Cluster (spacecraft)<sep>Inference<sep>Landmark<sep>Coronavirus<sep>Prostate cancer<sep>Pattern recognition (psychology)<sep>Stromal cell<sep>Noise (video)<sep>Cluster analysis<sep>Genome instability<sep>Proteases<sep>Androgen deprivation therapy<sep>Markov chain<sep>In situ hybridization<sep>Somatic cell<sep>Cell<sep>In situ<sep>Genome<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Image registration<sep>Range (aeronautics)<sep>Deconvolution<sep>High resolution<sep>Sample (material)<sep>Androgen receptor<sep>Bioconductor<sep>Somatic evolution in cancer<sep>Laboratory automation<sep>clone (Java method)<sep>Spatial analysis<sep>Transcriptome<sep>Automation<sep>TMPRSS2<sep>Sampling (signal processing)<sep>Image resolution<sep>Cell type</keyword><title>Super-resolved spatial transcriptomics by deep data fusion<sep>Spatial mapping of cell types by integration of transcriptomics data<sep>High-definition spatial transcriptomics for in situ tissue profiling<sep>Spatial landmark detection and tissue registration with deep learning<sep>SpatialCPie: an R/Bioconductor package for spatial transcriptomics cluster evaluation<sep>The spatial landscape of clonal somatic mutations in benign and malignant tissue<sep>Spatially resolved clonal copy number alterations in benign and malignant tissue<sep>Learning Stationary Markov Processes with Contrastive Adjustment<sep>Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics enables probabilistic inference of cell type topography<sep>Spatio-temporal analysis of prostate tumors in situ suggests pre-existence of treatment-resistant clones<sep>High-density spatial transcriptomics arrays for <i>in situ</i> tissue profiling<sep>Automation of Spatial Transcriptomics library preparation to enable rapid and robust insights into spatial organization of tissues<sep>Single-cell meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes across tissues and demographics<sep>Abstract A051: The spatial landscape of clonal somatic copy number alterations in benign and malignant prostate epithelia</title><abstract>Current methods for spatial transcriptomics are limited by low spatial resolution. Here we introduce a method that integrates spatial gene expression data with histological image data from the same tissue section to infer higher-resolution expression maps. Using a deep generative model, our method characterizes the transcriptome of micrometer-scale anatomical features and can predict spatial gene expression from histology images alone.<sep>Spatial transcriptomics and single cell RNA-sequencing offer complementary insights into the transcriptional expression landscape. We here present a probabilistic method that integrates data from both techniques, leveraging their respective strengths in such a way that we are able to spatially map cell types to a tissue. The method is applied to several different types of tissue where the spatial cell type topographies are successfully delineated.<sep>Spatial and molecular characteristics determine tissue function, yet high-resolution methods to capture both concurrently are lacking. Here, we developed high-definition spatial transcriptomics, which captures RNA from histological tissue sections on a dense, spatially barcoded bead array. Each experiment recovers several hundred thousand transcript-coupled spatial barcodes at 2-μm resolution, as demonstrated in mouse brain and primary breast cancer. This opens the way to high-resolution spatial analysis of cells and tissues.<sep>Abstract Spatial landmarks are crucial in describing histological features between samples or sites, tracking regions of interest in microscopy, and registering tissue samples within a common coordinate framework. Although other studies have explored unsupervised landmark detection, existing methods are not well-suited for histological image data as they often require a large number of images to converge, are unable to handle non-linear deformations between tissue sections, and are ineffective for z-stack alignment, other modalities beyond image data, or multimodal data. We address these challenges by introducing a new landmark detection and registration method, utilizing neural-network-guided thin-plate splines. Our proposed method is evaluated on a diverse range of datasets, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy and stability compared to existing approaches.<sep>Abstract Background Technological developments in the emerging field of spatial transcriptomics have opened up an unexplored landscape where transcript information is put in a spatial context. Clustering commonly constitutes a central component in analyzing this type of data. However, deciding on the number of clusters to use and interpreting their relationships can be difficult. Results We introduce SpatialCPie, an R package designed to facilitate cluster evaluation for spatial transcriptomics data. SpatialCPie clusters the data at multiple resolutions. The results are visualized with pie charts that indicate the similarity between spatial regions and clusters and a cluster graph that shows the relationships between clusters at different resolutions. We demonstrate SpatialCPie on several publicly available datasets. Conclusions SpatialCPie provides intuitive visualizations of cluster relationships when dealing with Spatial Transcriptomics data.<sep>Abstract Defining the transition from benign to malignant tissue is fundamental to improve early diagnosis of cancer. Here, we provide an unsupervised approach to study spatial genome integrity in situ to describe previously unidentified clonal relationships. We employed spatially resolved transcriptomics to infer spatial copy number variations in &gt;120 000 regions across multiple organs, in benign and malignant tissues. We demonstrate that genome-wide copy number variation reveals distinct clonal patterns within tumours and in nearby benign tissue using an organ-wide approach focused on the prostate. Our results suggest a model for how genomic instability arises in histologically benign tissue that may represent early events in cancer evolution. We highlight the power of capturing the molecular and spatial continuums in a tissue context and challenge the rationale for treatment paradigms, including focal therapy.<sep>Abstract Defining the transition from benign to malignant tissue is fundamental to improving early diagnosis of cancer 1 . Here we use a systematic approach to study spatial genome integrity in situ and describe previously unidentified clonal relationships. We used spatially resolved transcriptomics 2 to infer spatial copy number variations in &gt;120,000 regions across multiple organs, in benign and malignant tissues. We demonstrate that genome-wide copy number variation reveals distinct clonal patterns within tumours and in nearby benign tissue using an organ-wide approach focused on the prostate. Our results suggest a model for how genomic instability arises in histologically benign tissue that may represent early events in cancer evolution. We highlight the power of capturing the molecular and spatial continuums in a tissue context and challenge the rationale for treatment paradigms, including focal therapy.<sep>We introduce a new optimization algorithm, termed contrastive adjustment, for learning Markov transition kernels whose stationary distribution matches the data distribution. Contrastive adjustment is not restricted to a particular family of transition distributions and can be used to model data in both continuous and discrete state spaces. Inspired by recent work on noise-annealed sampling, we propose a particular transition operator, the noise kernel, that can trade mixing speed for sample fidelity. We show that contrastive adjustment is highly valuable in human-computer design processes, as the stationarity of the learned Markov chain enables local exploration of the data manifold and makes it possible to iteratively refine outputs by human feedback. We compare the performance of noise kernels trained with contrastive adjustment to current state-of-the-art generative models and demonstrate promising results on a variety of image synthesis tasks.<sep>Abstract The field of spatial transcriptomics is rapidly expanding, and with it the repertoire of available technologies. However, several of the transcriptome-wide spatial assays do not operate on a single cell level, but rather produce data comprised of contributions from a – potentially heterogeneous – mixture of cells. Still, these techniques are attractive to use when examining complex tissue specimens with diverse cell populations, where complete expression profiles are required to properly capture their richness. Motivated by an interest to put gene expression into context and delineate the spatial arrangement of cell types within a tissue, we here present a model-based probabilistic method that uses single cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data. To illustrate the capacity of our method, we use data from different experimental platforms and spatially map cell types from the mouse brain and developmental heart, which arrange as expected.<sep>The molecular mechanisms underlying lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer remain poorly understood, with intratumoral heterogeneity a likely contributing factor. To examine the temporal aspects of resistance, we analyze tumor heterogeneity in needle biopsies collected before and after treatment with androgen deprivation therapy. By doing so, we are able to couple clinical responsiveness and morphological information such as Gleason score to transcriptome-wide data. Our data-driven analysis of transcriptomes identifies several distinct intratumoral cell populations, characterized by their unique gene expression profiles. Certain cell populations present before treatment exhibit gene expression profiles that match those of resistant tumor cell clusters, present after treatment. We confirm that these clusters are resistant by the localization of active androgen receptors to the nuclei in cancer cells post-treatment. Our data also demonstrates that most stromal cells adjacent to resistant clusters do not express the androgen receptor, and we identify differentially expressed genes for these cells. Altogether, this study shows the potential to increase the power in predicting resistant tumors.<sep>Abstract Tissue function relies on the precise spatial organization of cells characterized by distinct molecular profiles. Single-cell RNA-Seq captures molecular profiles but not spatial organization. Conversely, spatial profiling assays either lack global transcriptome information or are not at the single-cell level. Here, we develop High-Density Spatial Transcriptomics (HDST), a method for RNA-seq at high spatial resolution. Spatially barcoded reverse transcription oligonucleotides are coupled to beads that are then randomly deposited in individual wells on a slide. The barcoded beads are decoded and coupled to a specific spatial address. We then capture and spatially in situ label RNA from the same histological tissue sections placed on the bead array slide. HDST recovers hundreds of thousands of transcript-coupled barcodes per experiment at 2 μm resolution. We demonstrate HDST in the mouse brain, use it to resolve spatial expression patterns and cell types, and show how to combine it with histological stains to relate expression patterns to tissue architecture and anatomy. HDST opens the way to 2D spatial analysis of tissues at high resolution.<sep>Abstract Background Interest in studying the spatial distribution of gene expression in tissues is rapidly increasing. Spatial Transcriptomics is a novel sequencing-based technology that generates high-throughput information on the distribution, heterogeneity and co-expression of cells in tissues. Unfortunately, manual preparation of high-quality sequencing libraries is time-consuming and subject to technical variability due to human error during manual pipetting, which results in sample swapping and the accidental introduction of batch effects. All these factors complicate the production and interpretation of biological datasets. Results We have integrated an Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform into the Spatial Transcriptomics workflow. Compared to the previously reported Magnatrix 8000+ automated protocol, this approach increases the number of samples processed per run, reduces sample preparation time by 35%, and minimizes batch effects between samples. The new approach is also shown to be highly accurate and almost completely free from technical variability between prepared samples. Conclusions The new automated Spatial Transcriptomics protocol using the Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform rapidly generates high-quality Spatial Transcriptomics libraries. Given the wide use of the Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform in research laboratories and facilities, this will allow many researchers to quickly create robust Spatial Transcriptomics libraries.<sep>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and accessory proteases (TMPRSS2 and CTSL) are needed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cellular entry, and their expression may shed light on viral tropism and impact across the body. We assessed the cell-type-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL across 107 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies from different tissues. ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL are coexpressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways and alveoli, and in cells from other organs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission or pathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals. This revealed cell-type-specific associations of age, sex and smoking with expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL. Expression of entry factors increased with age and in males, including in airway secretory cells and alveolar type 2 cells. Expression programs shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues included genes that may mediate viral entry, key immune functions and epithelial-macrophage cross-talk, such as genes involved in the interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and complement pathways. Cell-type-specific expression patterns may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and our work highlights putative molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention.<sep>Abstract Defining the transition from benign to malignant tissue is fundamental to improve early diagnosis of cancer. We provide an unsupervised approach (SpatialInferCNV) to study spatial genome integrity, in situ, to gain molecular insight into clonal relationships. We employed spatially resolved transcriptomics (Visium, 10x Genomics) to infer spatial copy number variations in &amp;gt;120 000 spatial regions across multiple organs, tissues and tumors, including three whole axial prostates. We used this information to deduce clonal relationships between regions harboring 5-20 cells. We perform an in-depth spatial analysis of prostate cancer that includes an unprecedented interrogation of up to 50,000 tissue domains in a single patient. For these domains we inferred genome-wide information, which facilitated data driven clustering in a tissue wide fashion at high resolution. We observed that genome-wide somatic copy number alterations revealed distinct clonal patterns benign tissue and nearby tumours. In a tissue section from patient 1 (section H2_1), we observed that many CNVs occurred in clone C, most notably in chromosomes 8 and 10 encoding a MYC amplification and a PTEN deletion. This clone constituted a region of exclusively benign acinar cells branching off a duct lined by largely diploid cells in clones A and B. The unobserved ancestor to clone C then gave rise to a further unobserved clone, and then clones E, F and G. Our results suggest a model for how genomic instability arises in histologically benign tissue that may represent early events in prostate cancer evolution. Furthermore the spatial information allowed us to identify small clonal units not evident from morphology and hence would be overlooked by pathologists. We present the first comprehensive, large-scale, atlas of genomic evolution at high spatial resolution in prostate cancer. Our study adds an important new approach to the armamentarium of cancer molecular pathology. We highlight the power of an unsupervised approach to capture the molecular and spatial continuums in a tissue context and challenge the rationale for focal therapy in prostate cancer.

We demonstrate that the two diseases share the same protective association at the HLA locus. HLA-specific fine-mapping showed that hierarchical protective effects of HLA-DRB1*04 subtypes best accounted for the association, strongest with HLA-DRB1*04:04 and HLA-DRB1*04:07, and intermediary with HLA-DRB1*04:01 and HLA-DRB1*04:03. The same signal was associated with decreased neurofibrillary tangles in postmortem brains and was associated with reduced tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid and to a lower extent with increased Aβ42. Protective HLA-DRB1*04 subtypes strongly bound the aggregation-prone tau PHF6 sequence, however only when acetylated at a lysine (K311), a common posttranslational modification central to tau aggregation. An HLA-DRB1*04-mediated adaptive immune response decreases PD and AD risks, potentially by acting against tau, offering the possibility of therapeutic avenues.<sep>Plasma biomarkers reflecting the pathology of frontotemporal dementia would add significant value to clinical practice, to the design and implementation of treatment trials as well as our understanding of disease mechanisms. The aim of this study was to explore the levels of multiple plasma proteins in individuals from families with genetic frontotemporal dementia.Blood samples from 693 participants in the GENetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative study were analysed using a multiplexed antibody array targeting 158 proteins.We found 13 elevated proteins in symptomatic mutation carriers, when comparing plasma levels from people diagnosed with genetic FTD to healthy non-mutation controls and 10 proteins that were elevated compared to presymptomatic mutation carriers.We identified plasma proteins with altered levels in symptomatic mutation carriers compared to non-carrier controls as well as to presymptomatic mutation carriers. Further investigations are needed to elucidate their potential as fluid biomarkers of the disease process.<sep>Genetic discoveries of Alzheimer's disease are the drivers of our understanding, and together with polygenetic risk stratification can contribute towards planning of feasible and efficient preventive and curative clinical trials. We first perform a large genetic association study by merging all available case-control datasets and by-proxy study results (discovery n = 409,435 and validation size n = 58,190). Here, we add six variants associated with Alzheimer's disease risk (near APP, CHRNE, PRKD3/NDUFAF7, PLCG2 and two exonic variants in the SHARPIN gene). Assessment of the polygenic risk score and stratifying by APOE reveal a 4 to 5.5 years difference in median age at onset of Alzheimer's disease patients in APOE ɛ4 carriers. Because of this study, the underlying mechanisms of APP can be studied to refine the amyloid cascade and the polygenic risk score provides a tool to select individuals at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.<sep>Characterization of the genetic landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADD) provides a unique opportunity for a better understanding of the associated pathophysiological processes. We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/'proxy' AD cases and 677,663 controls. We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in AD risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the APOE ε4 allele.<sep>Abstract Background Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease, resulting in progressive problems in language and/or behaviour and is often diagnosed before 65 years of age. Ubiquitin positive protein aggregates in the brain are among the key pathologic hallmarks of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) postmortem. The TANK-binding kinase 1 gene ( TBK1 ) is on the list of genes that can contribute to the development of FTD as well as the related neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods In this study, using an array of clinical and neuropathological data combined with biochemical and proteomics assays, we analyze the TBK1 splice-mutation (c.1340 + 1G &gt; A) in a Swedish family with a history of FTD and ALS. We also explore the K63 ubiquitination landscape in post-mortem brain tissue and fibroblast cultures. Results The intronic (c.1340 + 1G &gt; A) mutation in TBK1 results in haploinsufficiency and affects the activity of the protein in symptomatic and pre-symptomatic mutation carriers. Conclusion Our results suggest that the mutation leads to a significant reduction of TBK1 activity and induce alterations in K63 ubiquitination profile of the cell already in the presymptomatic stages.<sep>Abstract Background and Objective PSEN1 -H163Y carriers, at the presymptomatic stage, have reduced 18 FDG-PET binding in the cerebrum of the brain [1]. This could imply dysfunctional energy metabolism in the brain. In this study, plasma of presymptomatic PSEN1 mutation carriers was analyzed to understand associated metabolic changes. Methods We analyzed plasma from non-carriers (NC, n=8) and presymptomatic PSEN1 -H163Y mutation carriers (MC, n=6) via untargeted metabolomics using gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, which identified 1199 metabolites. All the metabolites were compared between MC and NC using univariate analysis, as well as correlated with the ratio of Aβ 1-42/Aβ1-40 , using Spearman’s correlation. Altered metabolites were subjected to Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). Results When comparing between presymptomatic MC and NC, the levels of 116 different metabolites were altered. Out of 116, only 23 were annotated metabolites, which include amino acids, fatty acyls, bile acids, hexoses, purine nucleosides, carboxylic acids, and glycerophosphatidylcholine species. 1-docosapentaenoyl-GPC, glucose and uric acid were correlated with the ratio of plasma Aβ 1-42 /Aβ 1-40 (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion This study finds dysregulated metabolite classes, which are changed before the disease onset. Also, it provides an opportunity to compare with sporadic Alzheimer’s Disease. Observed findings in this study need to be validated in a larger and independent Familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD) cohort. Graphical abstract<sep>PSEN1-H163Y carriers, at the presymptomatic stage, have reduced 18 FDG-PET binding in the cerebrum of the brain (Scholl et al., Neurobiol Aging 32:1388-1399, 2011). This could imply dysfunctional energy metabolism in the brain. In this study, plasma of presymptomatic PSEN1 mutation carriers was analyzed to understand associated metabolic changes.We analyzed plasma from noncarriers (NC, n = 8) and presymptomatic PSEN1-H163Y mutation carriers (MC, n = 6) via untargeted metabolomics using gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, which identified 1199 metabolites. All the metabolites were compared between MC and NC using univariate analysis, as well as correlated with the ratio of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 , using Spearman's correlation. Altered metabolites were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).Based on principal component analysis the plasma metabolite profiles were divided into dataset A and dataset B. In dataset A, when comparing between presymptomatic MC and NC, the levels of 79 different metabolites were altered. Out of 79, only 14 were annotated metabolites. In dataset B, 37 metabolites were significantly altered between presymptomatic MC and NC and nine metabolites were annotated. In both datasets, annotated metabolites represent amino acids, fatty acyls, bile acids, hexoses, purine nucleosides, carboxylic acids, and glycerophosphatidylcholine species. 1-docosapentaenoyl-GPC was positively correlated, uric acid and glucose were negatively correlated with the ratio of plasma Aβ1-42 /Aβ1-40 (P < 0.05).This study finds dysregulated metabolite classes, which are changed before the disease symptom onset. Also, it provides an opportunity to compare with sporadic Alzheimer's Disease. Observed findings in this study need to be validated in a larger and independent Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) cohort.<sep>Abstract Background The clinical presentations of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are diverse and overlap with other neurological disorders. There are, as of today, no biomarkers in clinical practice for diagnosing the disorders. Here, we aimed to find protein markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with FTD, presymptomatic mutation carriers and non-carriers. Methods Antibody suspension bead arrays were used to analyse 328 proteins in CSF from patients with behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD, n = 16) and progressive primary aphasia (PPA, n = 13), as well as presymptomatic mutation carriers (PMC, n = 16) and non-carriers (NC, n = 8). A total of 492 antibodies were used to measure protein levels by direct labelling of the CSF samples. The findings were further examined in an independent cohort including 13 FTD patients, 79 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and 18 healthy controls. Results We found significantly altered protein levels in CSF from FTD patients compared to unaffected individuals (PMC and NC) for 26 proteins. The analysis show patterns of separation between unaffected individuals and FTD patients, especially for those with a clinical diagnosis of bvFTD. The most statistically significant differences in protein levels were found for VGF, TN-R, NPTXR, TMEM132D, PDYN and NF-M. Patients with FTD were found to have higher levels of TN-R and NF-M, and lower levels of VGF, NPTXR, TMEM132D and PDYN, compared to unaffected individuals. The main findings were reproduced in the independent cohort. Conclusion In this pilot study, we show a separation of FTD patients from unaffected individuals based on protein levels in CSF. Further investigation is required to explore the CSF profiles in larger cohorts, but the results presented here has the potential to enable future clinical utilization of these potential biomarkers within FTD.<sep>Abstract Background A detailed understanding of the pathological processes involved in genetic frontotemporal dementia is critical in order to provide the patients with an optimal future treatment. Protein levels in CSF have the potential to reflect different pathophysiological processes in the brain. We aimed to identify and evaluate panels of CSF proteins with potential to separate symptomatic individuals from individuals without clinical symptoms (unaffected), as well as presymptomatic individuals from mutation non-carriers. Methods A multiplexed antibody-based suspension bead array was used to analyse levels of 111 proteins in CSF samples from 221 individuals from families with genetic frontotemporal dementia. The data was explored using LASSO and Random forest. Results When comparing affected individuals with unaffected individuals, 14 proteins were identified as potentially important for the separation. Among these, four were identified as most important, namely neurofilament medium polypeptide (NEFM), neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), neurosecretory protein VGF (VGF) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4). The combined profile of these four proteins successfully separated the two groups, with higher levels of NEFM and AQP4 and lower levels of NPTX2 in affected compared to unaffected individuals. VGF contributed to the models, but the levels were not significantly lower in affected individuals. Next, when comparing presymptomatic GRN and C9orf72 mutation carriers in proximity to symptom onset with mutation non-carriers, six proteins were identified with a potential to contribute to a separation, including progranulin (GRN). Conclusion In conclusion, we have identified several proteins with the combined potential to separate affected individuals from unaffected individuals, as well as proteins with potential to contribute to the separation between presymptomatic individuals and mutation non-carriers. Further studies are needed to continue the investigation of these proteins and their potential association to the pathophysiological mechanisms in genetic FTD.<sep>Abstract Background A novel panel of 14 proteins measured in the CSF could separate individuals with genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) from controls, with most significant findings observed for neurofilament medium (NEFM), neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), neurosecretory protein VGF (VGF) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) [1]. However, it is currently unknown whether these altered protein levels in the CSF reflect neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The aim of this study was to explore the cross‐sectional associations between the previously identified CSF biomarker candidates and cortical thickness in presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers, and whether those associations differ by FTD mutation type. Method We have analyzed T1 MRI scans alongside concurrent CSF samples from 202 individuals from the GENFI cohort, belonging to families that carry FTD mutations in either C9orf72 , GRN or MAPT genes. The study sample included symptomatic mutation carriers, presymptomatic mutation carriers and non‐carrier controls. Cortical thickness was estimated with FreeSurfer and CSF protein levels were measured via a multiplexed antibody‐based suspension bead array. The correlations between regional cortical thickness and protein levels were calculated via linear regression. Result Altered levels of NEFM, AQP4, APOA1, PTPRN2, CTSS, SERPINA3, C4, AMPH and CD14 were all correlated with increased atrophy of at least one cortical region. Some effects were mutation specific, but NEFM, AQP4 and APOA1 correlated with atrophy in all mutation groups. We also observed mutation specific effects for 10 of the proteins. CTSS levels were only correlated with cortical atrophy in C9orf72 mutation carriers while NPTX2, VGF and PTPRN2 correlated with atrophy in GRN mutation carriers. In MAPT mutation carriers, 6 different proteins correlated with atrophy in the right temporal pole. Conclusion The proposed fluid biomarker candidates continue to show promise and further longitudinal studies will contribute to elucidate their relationship to cortical atrophy and their prognostic value in genetic FTD.

Mol Neurodegener. 2021; 16(1):79<sep>The liver X receptors Lxrα/NR1H3 and Lxrβ/NR1H2 are ligand-dependent nuclear receptors critical for midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron development. We found previously that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC), the most potent and abundant Lxr ligand in the developing mouse midbrain, promotes mDA neurogenesis in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that 24,25-EC promotes mDA neurogenesis in an Lxr-dependent manner in the developing mouse midbrain in vivo and also prevents toxicity induced by the Lxr inhibitor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, using MS, we show that overexpression of human cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) increases the levels of both 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC) and 24,25-EC in the developing midbrain, resulting in a specific increase in mDA neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, but has no effect on oculomotor or red nucleus neurogenesis. 24-HC, unlike 24,25-EC, did not affect in vitro neurogenesis, indicating that the neurogenic effect of 24,25-EC on mDA neurons is specific. Combined, our results indicate that increased levels of 24,25-EC in vivo, by intracerebroventricular delivery in WT mice or by overexpression of its biosynthetic enzyme CYP46A1, specifically promote mDA neurogenesis. We propose that increasing the levels of 24,25-EC in vivo may be a useful strategy to combat the loss of mDA neurons in Parkinson's disease.

Here, we systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.<sep>Abstract The Karolinska KI/K COVID‐19 Immune Atlas project was conceptualized in March 2020 as a part of the academic research response to the developing SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. The aim was to rapidly provide a curated dataset covering the acute immune response towards SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in humans, as it occurred during the first wave. The Immune Atlas was built as an open resource for broad research and educational purposes. It contains a presentation of the response evoked by different immune and inflammatory cells in defined naïve patient‐groups as they presented with moderate and severe COVID‐19 disease. The present Resource Article describes how the Karolinska KI/K COVID‐19 Immune Atlas allows scientists, students, and other interested parties to freely explore the nature of the immune response towards human SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in an online setting.<sep>Many immunocompromised patients mount suboptimal humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Here, we assessed the single-cell profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells post-mRNA vaccination in healthy individuals and patients with various forms of immunodeficiencies. Impaired vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunity was observed in many immunocompromised patients, particularly in solid-organ transplant and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Notably, individuals with an inherited lack of mature B cells, i.e., X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) displayed highly functional spike-specific T cell responses. Single-cell RNA-sequencing further revealed that mRNA vaccination induced a broad functional spectrum of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in healthy individuals and patients with XLA. These responses were founded on polyclonal repertoires of CD4+ T cells and robust expansions of oligoclonal effector-memory CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells with stem-like characteristics. Collectively, our data provide the functional continuum of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses post-mRNA vaccination, highlighting that cell-mediated immunity is of variable functional quality across immunodeficiency syndromes.<sep>Lymphocyte migration is essential for adaptive immune surveillance. However, our current understanding of this process is rudimentary, because most human studies have been restricted to immunological analyses of blood and various tissues. To address this knowledge gap, we used an integrated approach to characterize tissue-emigrant lineages in thoracic duct lymph (TDL). The most prevalent immune cells in human and non-human primate efferent lymph were T cells. Cytolytic CD8+ T cell subsets with effector-like epigenetic and transcriptional signatures were clonotypically skewed and selectively confined to the intravascular circulation, whereas non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell subsets with stem-like epigenetic and transcriptional signatures predominated in tissues and TDL. Moreover, these anatomically distinct gene expression profiles were recapitulated within individual clonotypes, suggesting parallel differentiation programs independent of the expressed antigen receptor. Our collective dataset provides an atlas of the migratory immune system and defines the nature of tissue-emigrant CD8+ T cells that recirculate via TDL.<sep>Corona disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects multiple organ systems. Recent studies have indicated perturbations in the circulating metabolome linked to COVID-19 severity. However, several questions pertain with respect to the metabolome in COVID-19. We performed an in-depth assessment of 1129 unique metabolites in 27 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and integrated results with large-scale proteomic and immunology data to capture multiorgan system perturbations. More than half of the detected metabolic alterations in COVID-19 were driven by patient-specific confounding factors ranging from comorbidities to xenobiotic substances. Systematically adjusting for this, a COVID-19-specific metabolic imprint was defined which, over time, underwent a switch in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 seroconversion. Integration of the COVID-19 metabolome with clinical, cellular, molecular, and immunological severity scales further revealed a network of metabolic trajectories aligned with multiple pathways for immune activation, and organ damage including neurological inflammation and damage. Altogether, this resource refines our understanding of the multiorgan system perturbations in severe COVID-19 patients.<sep>Severe COVID-19 is characterized by excessive inflammation of the lower airways. The balance of protective versus pathological immune responses in COVID-19 is incompletely understood. Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are antimicrobial T cells that recognize bacterial metabolites, and can also function as innate-like sensors and mediators of antiviral responses. Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in the circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses indicated significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69high and CXCR3low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and later release back into the circulation when disease is resolved. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their possible involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.<sep>Adaptive immune responses have been studied extensively in the course of mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. Considerably fewer studies have assessed the effects on innate immune cells. Here, we characterized NK cells in healthy individuals and immunocompromised patients in the course of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA prospective, open-label clinical vaccine trial. See trial registration description in notes. Results revealed preserved NK cell numbers, frequencies, subsets, phenotypes, and function as assessed through consecutive peripheral blood samplings at 0, 10, 21, and 35 days following vaccination. A positive correlation was observed between the frequency of NKG2C+ NK cells at baseline (Day 0) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab titers following BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination at Day 35. The present results provide basic insights in regards to NK cells in the context of mRNA vaccination, and have relevance for future mRNA-based vaccinations against COVID-19, other viral infections, and cancer.Trial registration: The current study is based on clinical material from the COVAXID open-label, non-randomized prospective clinical trial registered at EudraCT and clinicaltrials.gov (no. 2021-000175-37). Description: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04780659?term=2021-000175-37&draw=2&rank=1 .<sep>Memory T cells are fundamental to maintain immune surveillance of the human body. During the past decade, it has become apparent that non-recirculating resident memory T cells (TRMs) form a first line memory response in tissues to tackle re-infections. The fact that TRMs are essential for local immunity highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting this population against tumors and infections. However, similar to other immune subsets, TRMs are heterogenous and may form distinct effector populations with unique functions at diverse tissue sites. Further insight into the mechanisms of how TRM function and respond to pathogens and malignancies at different mucosal sites will help to shape future vaccine and immunotherapeutic approaches. Here, we review the current understanding of TRM function and biology at four major mucosal sites: gastrointestinal tract, lung, head and neck, as well as female reproductive tract. We also summarize our current knowledge of how TRM targets invading pathogens and developing tumor cells at these mucosal sites and contemplate how TRMs may be exploited to protect from infections and cancer.<sep>Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are unconventional T cells with innate-like capacity to rapidly respond to microbial infection via MR1-restricted antigen recognition. Emerging evidence indicate that they can also act as rapid sensors of viral infection via innate cytokine activation. However, their possible role in the immune response to mRNA vaccination is unknown. Here, we evaluated the involvement of MAIT cells in individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. MAIT cell levels, phenotype and function in circulation were preserved and unperturbed through day 35 post-vaccination in healthy donor (HD) vaccinees, as well as people living with HIV (PLWH) or with primary immunodeficiency (PID). Unexpectedly, pre-vaccination and post-vaccination levels of MAIT cells correlated positively with the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses in the HD vaccinees. This pattern was largely preserved in the PID group, but less so in the PLWH group. Furthermore, in the HD vaccinees levels of MAIT cell activation and cytolytic potential correlated negatively to the adaptive antigen-specific immune responses. These findings indicate an unexpected association between MAIT cell compartment characteristics and the immune response magnitude to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.<sep>Abstract Objectives Humoral and cellular immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 following COVID‐19 will likely contribute to protection from reinfection or severe disease. It is therefore important to characterise the initiation and persistence of adaptive immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 amidst the ongoing pandemic. Methods Here, we conducted a longitudinal study on hospitalised moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients from the acute phase of disease into convalescence at 5 and 9 months post‐symptom onset. Utilising flow cytometry, serological assays as well as B cell and T cell FluoroSpot assays, we assessed the magnitude and specificity of humoral and cellular immune responses during and after human SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results During acute COVID‐19, we observed an increase in germinal centre activity, a substantial expansion of antibody‐secreting cells and the generation of SARS‐CoV‐2‐neutralising antibodies. Despite gradually decreasing antibody levels, we show persistent, neutralising antibody titres as well as robust specific memory B cell responses and polyfunctional T cell responses at 5 and 9 months after symptom onset in both moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients. Conclusion Our findings describe the initiation and, importantly, persistence of cellular and humoral SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific immunological memory in hospitalised COVID‐19 patients long after recovery, likely contributing towards protection against reinfection.<sep>Abstract T cells are critical to providing protection from severe COVID-19. However, whether repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination post-infection fuels T cell exhaustion or reshapes functionality remains debated. Here, we sampled SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors of different COVID-19 disease severity before and after subsequent mRNA vaccination to determine the functional consequences of hybrid immunity. Using combined single-cell protein and transcriptional analysis of T cells targeting different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we identified that spike-specific T cells increased in magnitude but, notably, also gained improved polyfunctional characteristics. In contrast, T cell responses targeting non-spike proteins diminished with time and functionally remained unchanged. Elevated IFN-γ expression was a common hallmark of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in mRNA-vaccinated individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These responses were founded on both pre-expanded and newly detected CD8 + T cell clones after vaccination. Elevated IFN-γ production and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were also found in patients with B cell abnormalities (chronic lymphocytic leukemia; CLL) after booster mRNA vaccination (four doses). Collectively, these data demonstrate limited signs of functional exhaustion and instead cumulative benefits of booster vaccination post-infection, increasing the quantity and quality of cell-mediated immunity.<sep>T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19, but it has remained unclear whether repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens delivered in the context of vaccination fuels T cell exhaustion or reshapes T cell functionality. Here, we sampled convalescent donors with a history of mild or severe COVID-19 before and after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to profile the functional spectrum of hybrid T cell immunity. Using combined single-cell technologies and high-dimensional flow cytometry, we found that the frequencies and functional capabilities of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in previously infected individuals were enhanced by vaccination, despite concomitant increases in the expression of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and TIM3. In contrast, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeting non-spike proteins remained functionally static and waned over time, and only minimal effects were observed in healthy vaccinated donors experiencing breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, hybrid immunity was characterized by elevated expression of IFN-γ, which was linked with clonotype specificity in the CD8+ T cell lineage. Collectively, these findings identify a molecular hallmark of hybrid immunity and suggest that vaccination after infection is associated with cumulative immunological benefits over time, potentially conferring enhanced protection against subsequent episodes of COVID-19.<sep>Abstract Severe COVID-19 is characterized by excessive inflammation of the lower airways. The balance of protective versus pathological immune responses in COVID-19 is incompletely understood. Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are antimicrobial T cells that recognize bacterial metabolites, and can also function as innate-like sensors and mediators of antiviral responses. Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation, as well as significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69 high and CXCR3 low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and subsequent release with disease resolution. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. One sentence summary MAIT cells are strongly activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in a manner associated with disease severity and outcome, they decline in blood, are enriched in the airways as a prominent IL-17A expressing subset, and dynamically recover in circulation during convalescence.<sep>Abstract Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant population of unconventional T cells in humans and play important roles in immune defense against microbial infections. Severe COVID-19 is associated with strong activation of MAIT cells and loss of these cells from circulation. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of MAIT cells to recover after severe COVID-19. In longitudinal paired analysis, MAIT cells initially rebounded numerically and phenotypically in most patients at 4 mo postrelease from the hospital. However, the rebounding MAIT cells displayed signs of persistent activation with elevated expression of CD69, CD38, and HLA-DR. Although MAIT cell function was restored in many patients, a subgroup displayed a predominantly PD-1high functionally impaired MAIT cell pool. This profile was associated with poor expression of IFN-γ and granzyme B in response to IL-12+IL-18 and low levels of polyfunctionality. Unexpectedly, although the overall T cell counts recovered, normalization of the MAIT cell pool failed at 9-mo follow-up, with a clear decline in MAIT cell numbers and a further increase in PD-1 levels. Together, these results indicate an initial transient period of inconsistent recovery of MAIT cells that is not sustained and eventually fails. Persisting MAIT cell impairment in previously hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may have consequences for antimicrobial immunity and inflammation and could potentially contribute to post-COVID-19 health problems.<sep>Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are being tested as a possible treatment for a wide range of diseases to exploit the immunomodulatory and regenerative potential demonstrated in vitro. Pooled human platelet lysate (pHPL) has replaced fetal bovine serum (FBS) as the preferred growth supplement because of its xeno-free origin and improved cell proliferation. Much has been done toward reducing the concentration of pHPL required when expanding ASCs. However, little is known on how increasing the concentration of pHPL affects ASC potency, which could lead to changes with possible beneficial applications. This study investigated the effect of 5, 10, or 20% pHPL in culture media on ASC proliferation and phenotypic marker expression, including chemokine receptors CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and VLA-4. Adipogenic and osteogenic properties, as well as immunosuppressive properties, including the ability to induce indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and suppress T cell proliferation, were also examined. We observed a significant increase in cell yield (approximately 2-fold) and a corresponding reduction in population doubling time and cell volume when doubling the concentration of pHPL in the growth media. ASCs maintained expression of phenotypic surface markers CD73, CD90, and CD105 and were negative for CD45 and CD31. The ability to induce IDO1 and suppress T cell proliferation was observed as well. Adipogenesis and osteogenesis, however, seem to be increased at higher concentrations of pHPL (20% > 10% > 5%), while expression of chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR3 was lower. In conclusion, increasing the pHPL concentration to 20% could be used to optimize culture conditions when producing cells for clinical treatments and may even be used to enhance beneficial ASC properties depending on the desired therapeutic effect.<sep>The adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a promising candidate for use in cell therapy and tissue engineering due to its regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. Some therapies are based on using the complete SVF product, whereas others depend on the expansion of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) in culture. The latter application often involves a time delay between adipose tissue harvest and SVF isolation. This study investigated how storage time and temperature affected cell quality and composition. Aliquots of lipoaspirate were stored cold (4°C), at room temperature (18–20°C), or at 37°C. SVF was isolated on sequential time points over a period of 48 h, and the following were assessed: cell viability, vitality, composition, and the proliferative potential of the ASCs. When the lipoaspirate was stored cold, the viability of the SVF remained stable for up to 48 h; however, the vitality of the SVF decreased significantly after 24 h. When stored at higher temperatures (room temperature or 37°C), the vitality of the SVF decreased after 8 h. The ASC fraction in the SVF decreased rapidly after 8 h when stored at higher temperatures, whereas this change was delayed significantly when the lipoaspirate was stored cold. Tendencies towards increases in the lag phase, population doubling time (PDt), and time to reach confluency were observed when the lipoaspirate was stored at higher temperatures. The vitality of the SVF was correlated significantly with the time of the lag phase and the time required to reach confluence, whereas no correlation was observed with the PDt. Both prolonged storage time and increased temperature during lipoaspirate storage negatively affected the quality of the obtained SVF. Our results suggest that lipoaspirate should be stored for no longer than 24 h at 4°C to maintain the optimal quality for the isolation of SVF and the expansion of ASCs.<sep>Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow, umbilical cord and especially adipose tissue are increasingly being explored for their therapeutic potential to treat a wide variety of diseases. A prerequisite for most allogeneic off-the-shelf and some autologous MSC therapies is the ability to safely and efficiently cryopreserve cells during production or for storage prior to treatment. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) is still the commonly used gold standard cryoprotectant (CPA). However, undesirable cellular impacts and side effects of Me2SO have led to an increasing demand for the development of safe and effective alternatives. This study investigated the effect of pentaisomaltose as a CPA for cryopreservation of adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs). We compared pentaisomaltose-based freezing media containing 1% Me2SO (PIM1) or 2% Me2SO (PIM2) to our in-house freezing media formulation containing 10% Me2SO (STD10) and to CryoStor freezing media containing 2% or 10% Me2SO (CS2 and CS10). We assessed the recovery of viable ASCs, their phenotype, differentiation potential, proliferation potential, and migratory potential. Further, their immunomodulatory potential was assessed by measuring their ability to suppress T cell proliferation and express immunomodulatory markers. The results showed that the post-thaw viability of ASCs cryopreserved with STD10, CS10 and PIM2 was improved compared to that of CS2. The recovery of ASCs with PIM1 and PIM2 was also improved compared to that of CS2. Proliferation and migration were comparable among the tested freezing media. The results showed no difference in the induction of PDL1, PDL2 or IDO1 expression. Nevertheless, the potential of cryopreserved ASCs to suppress T cell proliferation was reduced when the Me2SO concentration was reduced (CS10>STD10>CS2 and PIM2>PIM1). Altogether, the migratory and immunomodulatory potential combined with improved recovery indicate that the addition of pentaisomaltose in the freezing media may allow for the reduction of the Me2SO concentration to 2% while retaining a more potent cell product that what is recovered using comparable freezing media. With the desire to reduce the amount of Me2SO, these results suggest that 2% and potentially even 1% Me2SO in combination with 10% pentaisomaltose could be an effective and less toxic alternative to comparable freezing media.</abstract>", "<keyword>Genome<sep>Enhancer<sep>Chromatin<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Jurkat cells<sep>Transcription (linguistics)<sep>Mutation<sep>Regulatory sequence<sep>RNA polymerase II<sep>Transcriptome<sep>Gene expression<sep>Epigenetics<sep>DNA methylation<sep>Induced pluripotent stem cell<sep>Gene<sep>RNA<sep>RNA-Seq</keyword><title>NASC-seq monitors RNA synthesis in single cells<sep>Distinct transcription kinetics of pluripotent cell states<sep>Perturbed epigenetic transcriptional regulation in AML with IDH mutations causes increased susceptibility to NK cells<sep>Sequence determinants of human gene regulatory elements</title><abstract>Sequencing of newly synthesised RNA can monitor transcriptional dynamics with great sensitivity and high temporal resolution, but is currently restricted to populations of cells. Here, we develop new transcriptome alkylation-dependent single-cell RNA sequencing (NASC-seq), to monitor newly synthesised and pre-existing RNA simultaneously in single cells. We validate the method on pre-labelled RNA, and by demonstrating that more newly synthesised RNA was detected for genes with known high mRNA turnover. Monitoring RNA synthesis during Jurkat T-cell activation with NASC-seq reveals both rapidly up- and down-regulated genes, and that induced genes are almost exclusively detected as newly transcribed. Moreover, the newly synthesised and pre-existing transcriptomes after T-cell activation are distinct, confirming that NASC-seq simultaneously measures gene expression corresponding to two time points in single cells. Altogether, NASC-seq enables precise temporal monitoring of RNA synthesis at single-cell resolution during homoeostasis, perturbation responses and cellular differentiation.<sep>Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can adopt naïve, ground, and paused pluripotent states that give rise to unique transcriptomes. Here, we use transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) to define both coding and non-coding transcription units (TUs) in these three pluripotent states and combine TT-seq with RNA polymerase II occupancy profiling to unravel the kinetics of RNA metabolism genome-wide. Compared to the naïve state (serum), RNA synthesis and turnover rates are globally reduced in the ground state (2i) and the paused state (mTORi). The global reduction in RNA synthesis goes along with a genome-wide decrease of polymerase elongation velocity, which is related to epigenomic features and alterations in the Pol II termination window. Our data suggest that transcription activity is the main determinant of steady state mRNA levels in the naïve state and that genome-wide changes in transcription kinetics invoke ground and paused pluripotent states.<sep>Abstract Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations are found in 20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, only 30–40% of the patients respond to IDH inhibitors (IDHi). We aimed to identify a molecular vulnerability to tailor novel therapies for AML patients with IDH mutations. We characterized the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape with the IDH2i AG-221, using an IDH2 mutated AML cell line model and AML patient cohorts, and discovered a perturbed transcriptional regulatory network involving myeloid transcription factors that were partly restored after AG-221 treatment. In addition, hypermethylation of the HLA cluster caused a down-regulation of HLA class I genes, triggering an enhanced natural killer (NK) cell activation and an increased susceptibility to NK cell-mediated responses. Finally, analyses of DNA methylation data from IDHi-treated patients showed that non-responders still harbored hypermethylation in HLA class I genes. In conclusion, this study provides new insights suggesting that IDH mutated AML is particularly sensitive to NK cell-based personalized immunotherapy.<sep>DNA can determine where and when genes are expressed, but the full set of sequence determinants that control gene expression is unknown. Here, we measured the transcriptional activity of DNA sequences that represent an ~100 times larger sequence space than the human genome using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Machine learning models revealed that transcription factors (TFs) generally act in an additive manner with weak grammar and that most enhancers increase expression from a promoter by a mechanism that does not appear to involve specific TF-TF interactions. The enhancers themselves can be classified into three types: classical, closed chromatin and chromatin dependent. We also show that few TFs are strongly active in a cell, with most activities being similar between cell types. Individual TFs can have multiple gene regulatory activities, including chromatin opening and enhancing, promoting and determining transcription start site (TSS) activity, consistent with the view that the TF binding motif is the key atomic unit of gene expression.</abstract>", "<keyword>Extant taxon<sep>Vertebrate<sep>Genome<sep>Population genomics<sep>Genomics<sep>Population<sep>Genetic drift<sep>Critically endangered<sep>Reference genome</keyword><title>Population genomics of the critically endangered kākāpō<sep>Towards complete and error-free genome assemblies of all vertebrate species</title><abstract>The kākāpō is a flightless parrot endemic to New Zealand. Once common in the archipelago, only 201 individuals remain today, most of them descending from an isolated island population. We report the first genome-wide analyses of the species, including a high-quality genome assembly for kākāpō, one of the first chromosome-level reference genomes sequenced by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). We also sequenced and analyzed 35 modern genomes from the sole surviving island population and 14 genomes from the extinct mainland population. While theory suggests that such a small population is likely to have accumulated deleterious mutations through genetic drift, our analyses on the impact of the long-term small population size in kākāpō indicate that present-day island kākāpō have a reduced number of harmful mutations compared to mainland individuals. We hypothesize that this reduced mutational load is due to the island population having been subjected to a combination of genetic drift and purging of deleterious mutations, through increased inbreeding and purifying selection, since its isolation from the mainland ∼10,000 years ago. Our results provide evidence that small populations can survive even when isolated for hundreds of generations. This work provides key insights into kākāpō breeding and recovery and more generally into the application of genetic tools in conservation efforts for endangered species.<sep>Abstract High-quality and complete reference genome assemblies are fundamental for the application of genomics to biology, disease, and biodiversity conservation. However, such assemblies are available for only a few non-microbial species 1–4 . To address this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium 5,6 has worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop cost-effective methods for assembling highly accurate and nearly complete reference genomes. Here we present lessons learned from generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal biological discoveries. These include the identification of many false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a canonical GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their regulatory regions. Adopting these lessons, we have embarked on the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), an international effort to generate high-quality, complete reference genomes for all of the roughly 70,000 extant vertebrate species and to help to enable a new era of discovery across the life sciences.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Philosophy of education<sep>Realization

The trend of ever-increasing network traffic calls for contemporary network measurement approaches to have three key characteristics: accuracy, timeliness, and memory efficiency. The sketch algorithm offers a suitable trade-off between accuracy and memory consumption; however, its interval method is not as accurate and rapid as the sliding window method in Heavy Hitter detection. However, the sliding window method is believed to be highly memory-consuming.

This paper focuses on three fundamental network measurement tasks: membership query, frequency query, and heavy hitter query. The State-of-the-art Sliding Sketch (SS) is a sliding window framework for network measurement with the strengths of accurate, fast, and generic.

In an era in which results were derived from crude test tube-based assays, the replication of results was warranted. Those assays were often imprecise and required multiple replicates to arrive at results that approached accuracy. However, given technological advancements and excellent accuracy and precision of many modern LBAs, the practice of replicate testing should be re-evaluated.

Tumor cells in lymph nodes (LNs) are difficult to eliminate but underlie uncontrollable systemic metastasis. The CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) is overexpressed in tumor cells and interacts with CC chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21) secreted from LNs, potentiating their lymphatic migration. Here, a site‐specific polyplex is developed to block the CCR7‐CCL21 signal and kill tumor cells toward LNs, greatly limiting their lymphatic infiltration. A CCR7‐targeting small interfering RNA (siCCR7) is condensed by mPEG‐poly‐(lysine) with chlorin<sep>In recent years, the research on malware variant classification has attracted much more attention. However, there are still many challenges, including the low accuracy of classification of samples of similar malware families, high time, and resource consumption.

The molecular mechanisms causing COVID-19-induced ARDS have yet to be defined, though many studies have documented an increase in cytokines known as a “cytokine storm.” Here, we demonstrate that cytokines that activate the NF-kappaB pathway can induce Activin A and its downstream marker, FLRG. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients elevated Activin A/FLRG at baseline were predictive of the most severe longitudinal outcomes of COVID-19, including the need for mechanical ventilation, lack of clinical improvement and all-cause mortality. Patients with Activin A/FLRG above the sample median were 2.6/2.9 times more likely to die, relative to patients with levels below the sample median, respectively. The study indicates high levels of Activin A and FLRG put patients at risk of ARDS, and blockade of Activin A may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 patients experiencing ARDS.<sep>A subset of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly the aged and those with comorbidities, develop the most severe form of the disease, characterized by acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), coincident with experiencing a \"cytokine storm.\" Here, we demonstrate that cytokines which activate the NF-κB pathway can induce activin A. Patients with elevated activin A, activin B, and FLRG at hospital admission were associated with the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, including the requirement for mechanical ventilation, and all-cause mortality. A prior study showed that activin A could decrease viral load, which indicated there might be a risk to giving COVID-19 patients an inhibitor of activin. To evaluate this, the role for activin A was examined in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, via blockade of activin A signaling. The hamster model demonstrated that use of an anti-activin A antibody did not worsen the disease and there was no evidence for increase in lung viral load and pathology. The study indicates blockade of activin signaling may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 patients experiencing ARDS.<sep>Abstract Kidneys have one of the most complex three-dimensional cellular organizations in the body, but the spatial molecular principles of kidney health and disease are poorly understood. Here we generate high-quality single cell (sc), single nuclear (sn), spatial (sp) RNA expression and sn open chromatin datasets for 73 samples, capturing half a million cells from healthy, diabetic, and hypertensive diseased human kidneys. Combining the sn/sc and sp RNA information, we identify &gt; 100 cell types and states and successfully map them back to their spatial locations. Computational deconvolution of spRNA-seq identifies glomerular/vascular, tubular, immune, and fibrotic spatial microenvironments (FMEs). Although injured proximal tubule cells appear to be the nidus of fibrosis, we reveal the complex, heterogenous cellular and spatial organization of human FMEs, including the highly intricate and organized immune environment. We demonstrate the clinical utility of the FME spatial gene signature for the classification of a large number of human kidneys for disease severity and prognosis. We provide a comprehensive spatially-resolved molecular roadmap for the human kidney and the fibrotic process and demonstrate the clinical utility of spatial transcriptomics.<sep>We describe a Kappa-on-Heavy (KoH) mouse that produces a class of highly diverse, fully human, antibody-like agents. This mouse was made by replacing the germline variable sequences of both the Ig heavy-chain (IgH) and Ig kappa (IgK) loci with the human IgK germline variable sequences, producing antibody-like molecules with an antigen binding site made up of 2 kappa variable domains. These molecules, named KoH bodies, structurally mimic naturally existing Bence-Jones light-chain dimers in their variable domains and remain wild-type in their antibody constant domains. Unlike artificially diversified, nonimmunoglobulin alternative scaffolds (e.g., DARPins), KoH bodies consist of a configuration of normal Ig scaffolds that undergo natural diversification in B cells. Monoclonal KoH bodies have properties similar to those of conventional antibodies but exhibit an enhanced ability to bind small molecules such as the endogenous cardiotonic steroid marinobufagenin (MBG) and nicotine. A comparison of crystal structures of MBG bound to a KoH Fab versus a conventional Fab showed that the KoH body has a much deeper binding pocket, allowing MBG to be held 4 Å further down into the combining site between the 2 variable domains.<sep>Abstract Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Elevated intracardiac pressures and myocyte stretch in HF triggers release of counter-regulatory natriuretic peptides (NPs), which act via their receptor (NPR1) to affect vasodilation and natriuresis, lowering venous pressures and relieving venous congestion. Recombinant NP infusions were developed to treat HF but have been limited by a short duration of effect. Here, we report that, in a human genetic analysis of over 700,000 individuals, lifelong exposure to coding variants in the NPR1 gene are associated with changes in blood pressure (BP) and risk of HF. We then describe the development of an NPR1-agonist antibody, REGN5381, a novel investigational monoclonal agonist antibody targeting a membrane-bound guanylate cyclase receptor. REGN5381, an allosteric agonist of NPR1, induces an active-like receptor conformation resulting in hemodynamic effects preferentially on venous vasculature, including reductions in systolic BP and venous pressure in animal models. In healthy human volunteers, REGN5381 produced the expected hemodynamic effects, reflecting reductions in venous pressures. These data support the development of REGN5381 for long-lasting and selective lowering of venous pressures that drive symptomatology in patients with HF.<sep>Complement activation has been implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis. This study aimed to assess the levels of complement activation products and full-length proteins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and evaluated whether complement pathway markers are associated with outcomes. Longitudinal measurements of complement biomarkers from 89 hospitalized adult patients, grouped by baseline disease severity, enrolled in an adaptive, phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and treated with intravenous sarilumab (200 mg or 400 mg) or placebo (NCT04315298), were performed. These measurements were then correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters. All complement pathways were activated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Alternative pathway activation was predominant earlier in the disease course. Complement biomarkers correlated with multiple variables of multi-organ dysfunction and inflammatory injury. High plasma sC5b-9, C3a, factor Bb levels, and low mannan-binding lectin levels were associated with increased mortality. Sarilumab treatment showed a modest inhibitory effect on complement activation. Moreover, sera from patients spontaneously deposited C5b-9 complex on the endothelial surface ex vivo, suggesting a microvascular thrombotic potential. These results advance our understanding of COVID-19 disease pathophysiology and demonstrate the importance of specific complement pathway components as prognostic biomarkers in COVID-19.<sep>Microscopic analysis of urine sediment is probably the most commonly used diagnostic procedure in nephrology. The urinary cells, however, have not yet undergone careful unbiased characterization.Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed on 17 urine samples obtained from five subjects at two different occasions, using both spot and 24-hour urine collection. A pooled urine sample from multiple healthy individuals served as a reference control. In total 23,082 cells were analyzed. Urinary cells were compared with human kidney and human bladder datasets to understand similarities and differences among the observed cell types.Almost all kidney cell types can be identified in urine, such as podocyte, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and collecting duct, in addition to macrophages, lymphocytes, and bladder cells. The urinary cell-type composition was subject specific and reasonably stable using different collection methods and over time. Urinary cells clustered with kidney and bladder cells, such as urinary podocytes with kidney podocytes, and principal cells of the kidney and urine, indicating their similarities in gene expression.A reference dataset for cells in human urine was generated. Single-cell transcriptomics enables detection and quantification of almost all types of cells in the kidney and urinary tract.<sep>Complement is a key component of the innate immune system. Inappropriate complement activation underlies the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases. Complement component 5 (C5) is a validated therapeutic target for complement-mediated diseases, but the development of new therapeutics has been limited by a paucity of preclinical models to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of candidate therapies. The present report describes a novel humanized C5 mouse and its utility in evaluating a panel of fully human anti-C5 antibodies. Surprisingly, humanized C5 mice revealed marked differences in clearance rates amongst a panel of anti-C5 antibodies. One antibody, pozelimab (REGN3918), bound C5 and C5 variants with high affinity and potently blocked complement-mediated hemolysis in vitro. In studies conducted in both humanized C5 mice and cynomolgus monkeys, pozelimab demonstrated prolonged PK and durable suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo. In humanized C5 mice, a switch in dosing from in-house eculizumab to pozelimab was associated with normalization of serum C5 concentrations, sustained suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo, and no overt toxicity. Our findings demonstrate the value of humanized C5 mice in identifying new therapeutic candidates and treatment options for complement-mediated diseases.<sep>Keloids are benign, fibroproliferative dermal tumors that typically form due to abnormal wound healing. Current standard of care is generally ineffective and does not prevent recurrence. To characterize keloid scars and better understand the mechanism of their formation, we performed transcriptomic profiling of keloid biopsies from a total of 25 subjects of diverse racial and ethnic origins, 15 of whom provided a paired non-lesional sample, a longitudinal sample, or both. The transcriptomic signature of non-lesional skin biopsies from keloid subjects resembled control skin at baseline, but after dermal trauma shifted to closely match that of keloid skin. Peripheral keloid skin and re-biopsied surrounding normal skin both showed upregulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition markers, extracellular matrix organization, and collagen genes. These keloid signatures strongly overlapped those from healthy wound healing studies, usually with greater perturbations, reinforcing our understanding of keloids as dysregulated and exuberant wound healing. In addition, 219 genes uniquely regulated in keloids, but not in normal injured or uninjured skin, were also identified. This study provides insights into mature and developing keloid signatures that can act as a basis for further validation and target identification in the search for transformative keloid treatments.<sep>In most developed countries, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease. Although improvements in glycemic and blood pressure control have brought about reductions in cardiovascular disease and amputations, incident rates of end-stage renal disease have changed only minimally during the past 20 years. Furthermore, the presence of kidney disease correlates with excess mortality associated with diabetes. 1 Groop P.H. Thomas M.C. Moran J.L. et al.

Full-Text PDF<sep>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a clinical disorder characterised by reduced contractility of the heart muscle that is not explained by coronary artery disease or abnormal haemodynamic loading. Although Mendelian disease is well described, clinical testing yields a genetic cause in a minority of patients. The role of complex inheritance is emerging, however the common genetic architecture is relatively unexplored. To improve our understanding of the genetic basis of DCM, we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis comprising 14,255 DCM cases and 1,199,156 controls, and a multi-trait GWAS incorporating correlated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging traits of 36,203 participants. We identify 80 genetic susceptibility loci and prioritize 61 putative effector genes for DCM by synthesizing evidence from 8 gene prioritization strategies. Rare variant association testing identifies genes associated with DCM, including MAP3K7, NEDD4L , and SSPN . Through integration with single-nuclei transcriptomics from 52 end-stage DCM patients and 18 controls, we identify cellular states, biological pathways, and intercellular communications driving DCM pathogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that a polygenic score predicts DCM in the general population and modulates the penetrance of rare pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in DCM-causing genes. Our findings may inform the design of novel clinical genetic testing strategies incorporating polygenic background and the genes and<sep>Summary paragraph Heart failure (HF), a syndrome of symptomatic fluid overload due to cardiac dysfunction, is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder. Despite recent advances, mortality and morbidity remain high and treatment innovation is challenged by limited understanding of aetiology in relation to disease subtypes. Here we harness the de-confounding properties of genetic variation to map causal biology underlying the HF phenotypic spectrum, to inform the development of more effective treatments. We report a genetic association analysis in 1.9 million ancestrally diverse individuals, including 153,174 cases of HF; 44,012 of non-ischaemic HF; 5,406 cases of non-ischaemic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 3,841 cases of non-ischaemic HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We identify 66 genetic susceptibility loci across HF subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. We map the aetiologic contribution of risk factor traits and diseases as well as newly identified effector genes for HF, demonstrating differential risk factor effects on disease subtypes. Our findings highlight the importance of extra-cardiac tissues in HF, particularly the kidney and the vasculature in HFpEF. Pathways of cellular senescence and proteostasis are notably uncovered, including IGFBP7 as an effector gene for HFpEF. Using population approaches causally anchored in human genetics, we provide fundamental new insights into<sep>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disorder driven by unrelenting extracellular matrix deposition. Fibroblasts are recognized as the central mediators of extracellular matrix production in IPF; however, the characteristics of the underlying fibroblast cell populations in IPF remain poorly understood. Here, we use an unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model to characterize molecular responses to fibrotic injury. Lung cells were isolated on Day 11 to capture emerging fibrosis and gene expression was analyzed by three complementary techniques, which, together, generated a 49-gene signature that defined an activated subpopulation of fibroblasts. However, none of the identified genes were specific to the activated cells or to the disease setting, implying that the activated fibroblasts are not uniquely defined, but exhibit a similar, yet amplified, gene expression pattern to control cells. Our findings have important implications for fibrosis research, including: 1) defining myofibroblasts with any single marker will fail to capture much of the underlying biology; 2) fibroblast activation is poorly correlated with expression of transforming growth factor-β pathway genes; 3) single-cell analysis provides insight into the mechanism of action of effective therapies (nintedanib); 4) early events in lung fibrosis need not involve significant changes in fibroblast number; populations that do<sep>C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is characterized by the alternative-pathway (AP) hyperactivation induced by nephritic factors or complement gene mutations. Mice deficient in complement factor H (CFH) are a classic C3G model, with kidney disease that requires several months to progress to renal failure. Novel C3G models can further contribute to understanding the mechanism behind this disease and developing therapeutic approaches.A novel, rapidly progressing, severe, murine model of C3G was developed by replacing the mouse C3 gene with the human C3 homolog using VelociGene technology. Functional, histologic, molecular, and pharmacologic assays characterize the presentation of renal disease and enable useful pharmacologic interventions in the humanized C3 (C3hu/hu) mice.The C3hu/hu mice exhibit increased morbidity early in life and die by about 5-6 months of age. The C3hu/hu mice display elevated biomarkers of kidney dysfunction, glomerulosclerosis, C3/C5b-9 deposition, and reduced circulating C3 compared with wild-type mice. Administration of a C5-blocking mAb improved survival rate and offered functional and histopathologic benefits. Blockade of AP activation by anti-C3b or CFB mAbs also extended survival and preserved kidney function.The C3hu/hu mice are a useful model for C3G because they share many pathologic features consistent with the human disease. The C3G phenotype in C3hu/hu mice may originate from a dysregulated interaction of human C3 protein<sep>Activin A has been linked to cardiac dysfunction in aging and disease, with elevated circulating levels found in patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. Here, we investigated whether Activin A directly impairs cardiomyocyte (CM) contractile function and kinetics utilizing cell, tissue, and animal models. Hydrodynamic gene delivery-mediated overexpression of Activin A in wild-type mice was sufficient to impair cardiac function, and resulted in increased cardiac stress markers (N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide) and cardiac atrophy. In human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (hiPSC) CMs, Activin A caused increased phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 and significantly upregulated SERPINE1 and FSTL3 (markers of SMAD2/3 activation and activin signaling, respectively). Activin A signaling in hiPSC-CMs resulted in impaired contractility, prolonged relaxation kinetics, and spontaneous beating in a dose-dependent manner. To identify the cardiac cellular source of Activin A, inflammatory cytokines were applied to human cardiac fibroblasts. Interleukin -1β induced a strong upregulation of Activin A. Mechanistically, we observed that Activin A-treated hiPSC-CMs exhibited impaired diastolic calcium handling with reduced expression of calcium regulatory genes ( SERCA2 , RYR2 , CACNB2 ). Importantly, when Activin A was inhibited with an anti-Activin A antibody, maladaptive calcium handling and CM contractile dysfunction were abrogated. Therefore, inflammatory cytokines may play a key role by acting on cardiac fibroblasts,<sep>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disease caused by uncontrolled complement activation; effective and approved treatments include terminal complement inhibition. This study assessed whether combination cemdisiran (an investigational N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated RNAi therapeutic that suppresses liver production of complement component C5) and pozelimab (an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody against C5) results in more effective and durable complement activity inhibition than the individual agents alone in non-human primates. Cynomolgus monkeys received a single subcutaneous injection of cemdisiran (5 or 25 mg/kg), pozelimab (5 or 10 mg/kg), or combination cemdisiran and pozelimab (5+5 mg/kg, 5+10 mg/kg, or 25+10 mg/kg, respectively). When given in combination, pozelimab was administered 2 weeks after cemdisiran dosing. Pharmacokinetics and ex vivo pharmacodynamic properties were assessed. The half-life of pozelimab alone was 12.9-13.3 days; this increased to 19.6-21.1 days for pozelimab administered in combination with cemdisiran. In ex vivo classical pathway hemolysis assays (CH50), pozelimab + cemdisiran combinations achieved durable and more complete suppression of complement activity (8-13 weeks) vs monotherapy of either agent. Cemdisiran monotherapy demonstrated dose-dependent suppression of total C5 concentrations, with the higher dose (25 mg/kg) achieving >90% maximum suppression. Total C5 concentrations after administration of pozelimab + cemdisiran combinations were similar compared with administration of cemdisiran alone. The combination of pozelimab<sep>Echocardiography is a widely used and clinically translatable imaging modality for the evaluation of cardiac structure and function in preclinical drug discovery and development. Echocardiograms are among the first in vivo diagnostic tools utilized to evaluate the heart due to its relatively low cost, high throughput acquisition, and non-invasive nature; however lengthy manual image analysis, intra- and inter-operator variability, and subjective image analysis presents a challenge for reproducible data generation in preclinical research. To combat the image-processing bottleneck and address both variability and reproducibly challenges, we developed a semi-automated analysis algorithm workflow to analyze long- and short-axis murine left ventricle (LV) ultrasound images. The long-axis B-mode algorithm executes a script protocol that is trained using a reference library of 322 manually segmented LV ultrasound images. The short-axis script was engineered to analyze M-mode ultrasound images in a semi-automated fashion using a pixel intensity evaluation approach, allowing analysts to place two seed-points to triangulate the local maxima of LV wall boundary annotations. Blinded operator evaluation of the semi-automated analysis tool was performed and compared to the current manual segmentation methodology for testing inter- and intra-operator reproducibility at baseline and after a pharmacologic challenge. Comparisons between manual and semi-automatic derivation of LV ejection fraction resulted in a relative difference<sep>The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between factor XI (FXI) deficiency and the risks of bleeding and cardiovascular (CV) events. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS). We identified adults with FXI deficiency (severe: <15%, partial: 15 to <50%, any deficiency: <50%) that had been tested for FXI between 2007 and 2018 and matched to patients from the general MHS population. We estimated 10-year risks of outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we compared outcomes among patients with versus without FXI deficiency. Less than 10% of patients tested for FXI activity had activity levels <50% (mean age: 39 years; 72.2% females). Compared with the general population, patients with any FXI deficiency were at higher risk of severe bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-5.81; 10-year risk: 1.90%, 95% CI: 0.50-3.20% vs. 0.90%, 95% CI: 0.50-1.30%) and clinically relevant nonsevere bleeding (CRNSB) (aHR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.08-1.97; 10-year risk: 11.60%, 95% CI: 8.30-14.80% vs. 9.20%, 95% CI: 8.00-10.40%). Severe FXI deficiency was associated with a greater risk of CRNSB. While few CV events (N = 2) and venous thromboembolisms (VTE) (N = 1) were observed in the FXI overall deficient<sep>Activin A is a homo-dimeric TGF-β family member involved in embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, and cellular differentiation. Levels of activin A correlate with NYHA functional classification and age dependent cardiac dysfunction; however, no data are available to demonstrate a direct role for activin A in regulating human cardiomyocyte dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to characterize the functional impact of chronic activin A on human cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, contractility, calcium handling, and gene expression. Methods: Human iPSC-cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) were supplied by Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics. Calcium transients were captured using the FLIPR Tetra imager and impedance/electrophysiology by the Nanion CardioExcyte96. Cells were plated (50k/well), allowed to reach a stable synchronous monolayer, and dosed with 1nM of activin A (A) at each media change alongside a media control (C) or in the presence of inhibitory anti-activin A antibodies. Gene expression was determined using Taqman. Results: Activin A reduced contractile impedance amplitude (C=9.82±0.30, A=6.82±0.21 Ohms, p&lt;0.01) and slowed relaxation velocity kinetics (C=48.78±2.65, A=35.07±1.07 Ohms/sec, p&lt;0.01). Elongated extracellular field potential durations were observed with activin A treatment compared to control (C=0.49±0.02, A=0.56±0.01 sec, p&lt;0.01). Impaired calcium handling peak amplitude (C=609±99, A= C=447±33 RFU, p&lt;0.05) was also observed alongside slower calcium flux falling times (C=0.52±0.05, A=0.70±0.04 sec, p&lt;0.01).

To manage and utilize those above effectively, an industrial dataspace for machining workshop (IDMW) is presented with a three-layer framework. The IDMW architecture is Schema Centralized–Data Distributed, which relies on Process-Workpiece-Centric knowledge schema description and data storage in decentralized data silos. Subsequently, the pre-processing method for the data silos driven by RFID event graphical deduction model is elaborated to associate decentralized data with knowledge schema. Furthermore, through two industrial case studies, it is found that IDMW is effective in managing heterogeneous data, interconnecting the resource entities, handling domain knowledge, and thereby enabling machining operations control on the machining workshop floor particularly.<sep>Abstract This research investigates the effect of 40, 80, and 120 kHz ultrasound on heat transfer of laminar water flow over a heating flat plate using thin leaf thermocouples in a low turbulence water tunnel. The mainstream velocity was set at 0.127 m/s, corresponding to the local Reynolds number during 65,181 – 148,390 in the test section. The ultrasonic waves were released perpendicular to the mainstream and vertically from the upper wall at the distance of 0.15 m to the heating plate having constant heat flux of 1,040 W/m 2 . The results show that the ultrasound, having frequencies of 40 and 120 kHz provides the maximum Nusselt number up to 15% and 31%, respectively at the most downstream position of the test region. In the meantime, the 80 kHz waves slightly affect the heat transfer over a flat plate. Hence, in an attempt to employ the ultrasound for heat transfer enhancement over a flat plate, the distance and ultrasonic frequency must be well considered.<sep>Abstract Recently, ultrasound was discovered to have great potential in enhancing heat transfer from thermal systems., However, there is little information of the flow resistance, induced by its waves. Therefore, this research investigates the pressure loss of turbulent water flow in a circular pipe disturbed by 25 kHz ultrasound at the Reynolds number of 10,000, 12,500, 15,000, 17,500, 20,000, 22,500, and 25,000. The size of test section was modeled in accordance with the power plant’s condenser and the flow had been verified by the comparison of friction factor with theory. The maximum and minimum differences were 9.79 and 0.33%, respectively, confirming the reliability of the test setup. In this study, ultrasound was released along the mainstream flow from 3 and 15 transducers, installed upstream of the pipe. The results confirmed that the ultrasound was slightly affected on the friction loss of turbulent pipe flow. The average increase of pressure loss was 0.077% and 0.833% by the waves when they were emitted from 3 and 15 transducers, respectively. With very low inducement of flow resistance, ultrasound can be accounted as one of the most promising techniques for heat transfer enhancement, applicable to many thermal systems such as condensers, in the future.<sep>The characteristics of the heat transfer and friction loss of turbulent water flow in a circular pipe were investigated experimentally at a constant surface temperature of 45 ℃ for 28 kHz ultrasound propagation along the mainstream flow. Transducers were installed in five rows and three columns in the upstream section of the test pipe, and the number of active transducers was varied (1, 3, and 15) for a Reynolds number range of 10,000-25,000. The results indicated that the ultrasonic effects yielded positive results for both the heat transfer and pressure loss of the pipe flow. Under the influence of 15 ultrasonic transducers, the maximum Nusselt number ratio was 1.57 and the greatest reduction in the friction factor was 21.6 % for a Reynolds number of 10,000. The corresponding maximum thermal performance factor was approximately 1.7. However, the thermal efficiency tended to decrease with an increase in the number of transducers. The maximum thermal efficiency values under ultrasonic waves with 1, 3, and 15 transducers were 5.43, 3.37, and 1.95, respectively. When the change in the friction factor per ultrasonic input power was considered, the most suitable number of ultrasonic transducers was three. Finally, predictive formulas were proposed for the Nusselt number ratio and friction factor ratio under low-frequency ultrasound, with deviations from -5.5 % to 5.4 % and -7.4 % to 7.4 %, respectively.<sep>This paper presents a new development of an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for a Hybrid Ground Source Heat Pump (HGSHP). The HGSHP is equipped with a supplementary heat sink composter to process organic solid waste (OSW), utilizing excess hot air from the condensing unit to aerate the compost pile. The Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) was developed using data collected by effective sensors installed in the HGSHP system. The main objective is to control the water flow rate with a Variable Speed Drive (VSD) to improve overall system performance. The dataset for ANFIS has been created and trained using MATLAB® software, then implemented on a Raspberry Pi nano-computer with Python coding. This paper compares the performance of ANFIS with two different cases: ANFIS with Triangular Membership Function (TriMF) and ANFIS with Gaussian Membership Function (GaussMF). After implementing ANFIS with TriMF and GaussMF, the average COP during composter operation and system cooling significantly increased. In contrast, the HGSHP system power consumption is sufficiently reduced in both case studies. Moreover, ANFIS also benefits the composting process, as evidenced by the increase in composter operation time, and vice versa for system cooling time. Ultimately, the implementation of ANFIS can improve the HGSHP system performance in both the TriMF and GaussMF cases, with the TriMF case showing a significant improvement in the HGSHP system performance compared to the GaussMF case.</abstract>", "<keyword>Pyridine<sep>Hippocampal formation<sep>Depolarization<sep>Western blot<sep>In vivo<sep>Boundary (topology)<sep>In vitro<sep>RNA<sep>Homogeneous<sep>Selectivity<sep>HBeAg<sep>Coccidiosis<sep>TUNEL assay<sep>Autophagy<sep>Neurodegeneration<sep>Broiler<sep>Prebiotic<sep>Polysaccharide<sep>Metal-organic framework<sep>HBsAg<sep>Dithiocarbamate<sep>Spinal cord<sep>Hepatitis B virus<sep>Myopathy<sep>Throughput<sep>Spinal cord injury<sep>Immunohistochemistry<sep>Neurotoxicity<sep>Mesenchymal stem cell<sep>Microscopy<sep>Bovine serum albumin<sep>Function (biology)<sep>Thais<sep>IC50<sep>Acetylcholinesterase<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Myocyte<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Ruthenium red<sep>Lycium<sep>Terbium<sep>Enzyme<sep>Glutathione<sep>Neuroglobin<sep>Ischemia<sep>Hepatitis B<sep>Morris water navigation task<sep>Poultry farming<sep>Uniporter<sep>Decellularization<sep>Embryonic stem cell<sep>Transcriptome<sep>Gut flora<sep>Fluorescence<sep>Aché<sep>Scaffold<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Gene<sep>Bone marrow<sep>Spatial contextual awareness</keyword><title>Cost-efficient boundary-free surface patterning achieves high effective-throughput of time-lapse microscopy experiments<sep>Two Stable Terbium–Organic Frameworks Based on Predesigned Functionalized Ligands: Selective Sensing of Fe<sup>3+</sup> Ions and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> Separation<sep>GSH‐Responsive Dnase‐I‐Loaded MnO<sub><i>x</i></sub> Nanoplatforms for Combined Protein‐Chemodynamic Therapy<sep>Technical Advances and Applications of Spatial Transcriptomics<sep>Dexmedetomidine protects hippocampal neurons against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis through activation HIF-1α/p53 signaling<sep>Novel chromanone-dithiocarbamate hybrids as multifunctional AChE inhibitors with β-amyloid anti-aggregation properties for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease<sep>Preparation of an acellular spinal cord scaffold to improve its biological properties<sep>A homogeneous polysaccharide from Lycium barbarum: Structural characterizations, anti-obesity effects and impacts on gut microbiota<sep>Rapid Intramitochondrial Zn2+ Accumulation in CA1 Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons After Transient Global Ischemia: A Possible Contributor to Mitochondrial Disruption and Cell Death<sep>Construction of a NT-3 sustained-release system cross-linked with an acellular spinal cord scaffold and its effects on differentiation of cultured bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells<sep>Anti-HBV Activities of Polysaccharides from Thais clavigera (Küster) by In Vitro and In Vivo Study<sep>Assessing the prevalence and economic significance of coccidiosis individually and in combination with concurrent infections in Pakistani commercial poultry farms<sep>Blocking Mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> Accumulation after Ischemia Reduces Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Neuronal Injury<sep>VCP/p97 inhibitor CB-5083 modulates muscle pathology in a mouse model of VCP inclusion body myopathy</title><abstract>Time-lapse microscopy plays critical roles in the studies of cellular dynamics. However, setting up a time-lapse movie experiments is not only laborious but also with low output, mainly due to the cell-losing problem (i.e., cells moving out of limited field of view), especially in a long-time recording. To overcome this issue, we have designed a cost-efficient way that enables cell patterning on the imaging surfaces without any physical boundaries. Using mouse embryonic stem cells as an example system, we have demonstrated that our boundary-free patterned surface solves the cell-losing problem without disturbing their cellular phenotype. Statistically, the presented system increases the effective-throughput of time-lapse microscopy experiments by an order of magnitude.<sep>To construct desired metal-organic framework (MOF) sensors, the predesigned functionalized ligands 2,5-bis(2',5'-dicarboxylphenyl)pyridine (L-N) and 2,5-bis(2',5'-dicarboxylphenyl)difluorobenzene (L-F) with pyridine- and fluorine-decorated tetracarboxylic acids were used, and two stable terbium-organic frameworks, H3O[(Tb(L-N)(H2O)2]·2H2O (Tb-N) and [Tb3(L-F)2(HCOO)(H2O)4]·6H2O (Tb-F), have been synthesized. The structures of Tb-N and Tb-F contain 1D open channels, which are functionalized by pyridine N or F atoms, respectively. Both of them show intense fluorescence in water and exhibit excellent selectivity and sensitivity to Fe3+ ions. The effects of different functional group sites on the stability and fluorescence sensing performance of MOFs have also been studied. In addition, a gas adsorption study demonstrates that Tb-N is capable of adsorbing C2H2 over CH4 selectively.<sep>The effective delivery of protein therapeutics remains a major challenge. Here, the novel nanoplatforms with bovine serum albumin (BSA)‐coated, Dnase‐1‐loaded MnO x nanoflowers are developed (denominated MD@BSA). These MD@BSA nanoplatforms present a highly efficient protein loading and effective delivery Dnase‐I into tumor cells. Under the glutathione (GSH) overexpression environment, MD@BSA is degradable, resulting in Dnase‐1 and Mn 2+ release for combining protein therapeutics and chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and the GSH‐responsive MR imaging in vivo and vitro that could be used to trace and evaluate the severity of tumor for therapeutic regimen adjustment. This method offers a facile and GSH‐responsive strategy for both delivering proteins and enhanced treatment effect via combined protein‐CDT, which may contribute to the clinical application of protein therapeutics in the future.<sep>Transcriptomics is one of the largest areas of research in biological sciences. Aside from RNA expression levels, the significance of RNA spatial context has also been unveiled in the recent decade, playing a critical role in diverse biological processes, from subcellular kinetic regulation to cell communication, from tissue architecture to tumor microenvironment, and more. To systematically unravel the positional patterns of RNA molecules across subcellular, cellular, and tissue levels, spatial transcriptomics techniques have emerged and rapidly became an irreplaceable tool set. Herein, we review and compare current spatial transcriptomics techniques on their methods, advantages, and limitations, as well as applications across a wide range of biological investigations. This review serves as a comprehensive guide to spatial transcriptomics for researchers interested in adopting this powerful suite of technologies.<sep>To observe the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on mitochondrial apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) brain injury in developing rats, and to investigate its regulatory mechanism on HIF-1α/p53 signaling pathway. Hypoxia/reoxygenation model was used in this study. TUNEL assay was performed to detect cell apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analysis and Western-blotting analysis were conducted to detect Cytochrome-C (Cyt-c), APAF-1, Caspase-3, Neuroglobin (Ngb), HIF-1α and p53 expression. After 28 days, Morris water maze (MWM) was performed. 50 μg/kg DEX improved H/R-induced brain injury and inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in rats. Western-blotting and Immunohistochemical results demonstrated that DEX could up-regulate Ngb through α2 receptor to inhibit H/R-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. In addition, by adding inhibitors yohimbine and 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), we found that DEX could activate HIF-1α/p53 signaling pathway. MWM test showed that DEX could enhance long-term learning and memory of H/R brain injury rats. DEX alleviates H/R-induced brain injury and mitochondrial apoptosis in developing rats through α2 receptor, which may be related to activation of HIF-1α/p53 signaling pathway to up-regulate the expression of Ngb.<sep>By connecting chromanone with dithiocarbamate moieties through flexible linkers, a series of hybrids as novel multifunctional AChE inhibitors have been designed and synthesized. Most of these compounds displayed strong and excellently selective inhibition to eeAChE as well as potent inhibition to self- and AChE-induced Aβ aggregation. Among them, compound 6c showed the best activity to inhibit eeAChE (IC50 = 0.10 μM) and AChE-induced Aβ aggregation (33.02% at 100 μM), and could effectively inhibit self-induced Aβ aggregation (38.25% at 25 μM). Kinetic analysis and docking study indicated that compound 6c could target both the CAS and PAS, suggesting that it was a dual binding site inhibitor for AChE. Besides, it exhibited good ability to penetrate the BBB and low neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. More importantly, compound 6c was well tolerated in mice (2500 mg/kg, po) and could attenuate the memory impairment in a scopolamine-induced mouse model. Overall, these results highlight 6c as a promising multifunctional agent for treating AD and also demonstrate that the dithiocarbamate is a valid scaffold for design of multifunctional AChE inhibitors.<sep>In recent years, acellular spinal cord scaffolds have been extensively studied in tissue engineering. Notably, acellular spinal cord scaffolds may be used to treat spinal cord injury; however, the method of preparation can result in low efficiency and may affect the biological properties of cells. This study aimed to use EDC crosslinking, combined with chemical extraction for tissue decellularization, in order to improve the efficiency of acellular scaffolds. To make the improved stent available for the clinical treatment of spinal cord injury, it is necessary to study its immunogenicity. Therefore, this study also focused on the adherence of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to scaffolds, and their differentiation into neuron‑like cells in the presence of suitable trophic factors. The results revealed that EDC crosslinking combined with chemical extraction methods may significantly improve the efficiency of acellular scaffolds, and may also confer better biological characteristics, including improved immunogenicity. Notably, it was able to promote adhesion of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and their differentiation into neuron‑like cells. These results suggested that the improved preparation method may be promising for the construction of multifunctional acellular scaffolds for the treatment of spinal cord injury.<sep>Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) are known for their beneficial effects on diabetes, NAFLD and related chronic metabolic diseases induced by high-fat diet (HFD). However, the relevant researches are mainly about the whole crude polysaccharides, the specific active ingredient of LBPs and its bioactivity have been rarely explored. Herein, a homogeneous polysaccharide (LBP-W) was isolated and purified from crude LBPs. Structure characterizations indicated that LBP-W contained a main chain consisting of a repeated unit of →6)-β-Galp(1 → residues with branches composed of α-Araf, β-Galp and α-Rhap residues at position C-3. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-obesogenic effect of LBP-W and figure out the underlying mechanisms. In vivo efficacy trial illustrated that LBP-W supplements can alleviate HFD-induced mice obesity significantly. Gut microbiota analysis showed that LBP-W not only improved community diversity of intestinal flora, but also regulated their specific genera. Moreover, LBP-W can increase the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a metabolite of the intestinal flora. In summary, all these results demonstrated that the homogeneous polysaccharide purified from L. barbarum could be used as a prebiotic agent to improve obesity by modulating the composition of intestinal flora and the metabolism of SCFAs.<sep>Mitochondrial Zn2+ accumulation, particularly in CA1 neurons, occurs after ischemia and likely contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent neurodegeneration. However, the relationship between mitochondrial Zn2+ accumulation and their disruption has not been examined at the ultrastructural level in vivo. We employed a cardiac arrest model of transient global ischemia (TGI), combined with Timm's sulfide silver labeling, which inserts electron dense metallic silver granules at sites of labile Zn2+ accumulation, and used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine subcellular loci of the Zn2+ accumulation. In line with prior studies, TGI-induced damage to CA1 was far greater than to CA3 pyramidal neurons, and was substantially progressive in the hours after reperfusion (being significantly greater after 4- than 1-hour recovery). Intriguingly, TEM examination of Timm's-stained sections revealed substantial Zn2+ accumulation in many postischemic CA1 mitochondria, which was strongly correlated with their swelling and disruption. Furthermore, paralleling the evolution of neuronal injury, both the number of mitochondria containing Zn2+ and the degree of their disruption were far greater at 4- than 1-hour recovery. These data provide the first direct characterization of Zn2+ accumulation in CA1 mitochondria after in vivo TGI, and support the idea that targeting these events could yield therapeutic benefits.<sep>This study sought to promote the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by constructing a neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) sustained-release system cross-linked with an acellular spinal cord scaffold. 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) chemistry combined with chemical extraction was used to construct an acellular spinal cord scaffold. The decellularization completion was validated. An EDC cross-linking method was used to construct the NT-3 cross-linked acellular spinal scaffold. ELISA was used to verify sustained release of NT-3; the dorsal root ganglion method was used to verify the biological activity of the sustained-release NT-3. DAPI staining was used to confirm the adhesion of the cultured rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (P3) to the NT-3 scaffold, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) analysis was used to verify the cellular proliferation after 24 h and 48 h of culture. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm the differentiation of the bone marrow cells into neuron-like cells. An NT-3 sustained-release system cross-linked to an acellular spinal cord scaffold was successfully constructed. Sustained-release NT-3 could persist for 35 days and had biological activity for at least 21 days. It could promote the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. As a composite scaffold, an NT-3 sustained-release system cross-linked with an acellular spinal cord scaffold has potential applications for tissue engineering.<sep>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major global health problem. It is therefore imperative to develop drugs for anti-hepatitis B with high-efficiency and low toxicity. Attracted by the observations and evidence that the symptoms of some patients from the Southern Fujian, China, suffering from hepatitis B were alleviated after daily eating an edible marine mollusk, Thais clavigera (Küster 1860) (TCK). Water-soluble polysaccharide from TCK (TCKP1) was isolated and characterized. The anti-HBV activity of TCKP1 and its regulatory pathway were investigated on both HepG2.2.15 cell line and HBV transgenic mice. The data obtained from in vitro studies showed that TCKP1 significantly enhanced the production of IFN-α, and reduced the level of HBV antigens and HBV DNA in the supernatants of HepG2.2.15 cells in a dose-dependent manner with low cytotoxicity. The result of the study on the HBV transgenic mice further revealed that TCKP1 significantly decreased the level of transaminases, HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA in the serum, as well as HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV DNA, and HBV RNA in the liver of HBV transgenic (HBV-Tg) mice. Furthermore, TCKP1 exhibited equivalent inhibitory effect with the positive control tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) on the markers above except for HBV DNA even in low dosage in a mouse model. However, the TCKP1 high-dose group displayed stronger inhibition of transaminases and liver HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV RNA when compared with those of TAF. Meanwhile, inflammation of the liver was, by pathological observation, relieved in a dose-dependent manner after being treated with TCKP1. In addition, elevated levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon γ (IFN-γ), and reduced level of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the serum were observed, indicating that the anti-HBV effect of TCKP1 was achieved by potentiating immunocyte function and regulating the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokines.<sep>Coccidiosis is one of the most economically important diseases of the poultry, around the globe. In order to assess seasonal and age-wise prevalence of coccidiosis individually and with concurrent infections, this study was conducted on commercial poultry farms in and around Multan division, province of Punjab, Pakistan. A total of 28,126 boilers, 4,052 layers and 7,699 golden bird samples, provided by regional farmers and consultants, were examined by microscopy for the diagnosis of coccidiosis. Based on postmortem lesions, several infections including coccidiosis, viral, and miscellaneous diseases were catalogued, whereas samples were cultured to identify concurrent bacterial diseases. Cumulative analysis of this large set of samples revealed a prevalence of 14.16, 11.01, and 19.57% in broiler, layer and golden birds, respectively. Ascaridia galli(A. galli) showed a higher prevalence in layer (2.47%) compared to golden (0.21%) birds (P< 0.01). Amongst all concurrent infections investigated, bacterial infections were identified in highest percentage of samples (59.24%; P< 0.05). The age-wise and season-wise prevalence of coccidiosis and A. galliwas found to be significant (P< 0.05). During the study period, an estimated of 10.69 (coccidiosis) and 0.29 (A. galli) million poultry birds were treated or provided prophylaxis and supportive therapy at Pakistani commercial poultry farms. Depending upon the prevailing market conditions, the total economic losses (treatment, prophylaxis, and supportive therapy) from coccidiosis and A. galliwere estimated to be US $45,405.00 and 2,638.50, respectively, while production (weight and eggs) losses for broiler (US$ 2,750,779.00), layer and golden, young (US$ 13,974.98 and 50,228.76) and adult (US$ 104.74 and 203.77) were estimated. Unit loss of coccidiosis with concurrent diseases and intestinal worm was estimated to be US$ 0.005 and 0.01, respectively. These results highlight the potential impact of coccidiosis individually and with concurrent infections on the poultry productivity and will inform farmers, policy makers, and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders on the use of control and management measures in containing these infections.<sep>Zn2+ is an important contributor to ischemic brain injury and recent studies support the hypothesis that mitochondria are key sites of its injurious effects. In murine hippocampal slices (both sexes) subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), we found that Zn2+ accumulation and its entry into mitochondria precedes and contributes to the induction of acute neuronal death. In addition, if the ischemic episode is short (and sublethal), there is ongoing Zn2+ accumulation in CA1 mitochondria after OGD that may contribute to their delayed dysfunction. Using this slice model of sublethal OGD, we have now examined Zn2+ contributions to the progression of changes evoked by OGD and occurring over 4-5 hours. We detected progressive mitochondrial depolarization occurring from ∼ 2 hours after ischemia, a large increase in spontaneous synaptic activity between 2-3 hours, and mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation at 4 hours. Blockade of the primary route for Zn2+ entry, the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU; with ruthenium red, RR) or Zn2+ chelation shortly after OGD withdrawal substantially attenuated the mitochondrial depolarization and the changes in synaptic activity. RR also largely reversed the mitochondrial swelling. Finally, using an in vivo rat (male) asphyxial cardiac arrest (CA) model of transient global ischemia, we found that ∼8 min asphyxia induces considerable injury of CA1 neurons 4 hours later that is associated with strong Zn2+ accumulation within many damaged mitochondria. These effects were substantially attenuated by infusion of RR upon reperfusion. Our findings highlight mitochondrial Zn2+ accumulation after ischemia as a possible target for neuroprotective therapy.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:Brain ischemia is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability that still lacks effective treatment. After transient ischemia delayed death of neurons occurs in vulnerable brain regions. There is a critical need to understand mechanisms of this delayed neurodegeneration which can be targeted for neuroprotection. We found progressive and long-lasting mitochondrial Zn2+ accumulation to occur in highly vulnerable CA1 neurons after ischemia. Here we demonstrate that this Zn2+ accumulation contributes strongly to deleterious events occurring after ischemia including mitochondrial dysfunction, swelling and structural changes. We suggest that this mitochondrial Zn2+ entry may constitute a promising target for development of therapeutic interventions to be delivered after termination of an episode of transient global ischemia.<sep>Abstract Background Pathogenic gain of function variants in Valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) cause a unique disease characterized by inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (also known as Multisystem proteinopathy (MSP)). Previous studies in drosophila models of VCP disease indicate treatment with VCP inhibitors mitigates disease pathology. Earlier-generation VCP inhibitors display off-target effects and relatively low therapeutic potency. New generation of VCP inhibitors needs to be evaluated in a mouse model of VCP disease. In this study, we tested the safety and efficacy of a novel and potent VCP inhibitor, CB-5083 using VCP patient-derived myoblast cells and an animal model of VCP disease. Methods First, we analyzed the effect of CB-5083 in patient-derived myoblasts on the typical disease autophagy and TDP-43 profile by Western blot. Next, we determined the maximum tolerated dosage of CB-5083 in mice and treated the 2-month-old VCP R155H/R155H mice for 5 months with 15 mg/kg CB-5083. We analyzed motor function monthly by Rotarod; and we assessed the end-point blood toxicology, and the muscle and brain pathology, including autophagy and TDP-43 profile, using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. We also treated 12-month-old VCP R155H/+ mice for 6 months and performed similar analysis. Finally, we assessed the potential side effects of CB-5083 on retinal function, using electroretinography in chronically treated VCP R155H/155H mice. Results In vitro analyses using patient-derived myoblasts confirmed that CB-5083 can modulate expression of the proteins in the autophagy pathways. We found that chronic CB-5083 treatment is well tolerated in the homozygous mice harboring patient-specific VCP variant, R155H, and can ameliorate the muscle pathology characteristic of the disease. VCP-associated pathology biomarkers, such as elevated TDP-43 and p62 levels, were significantly reduced. Finally, to address the potential adverse effect of CB-5083 on visual function observed in a previous oncology clinical trial, we analyzed retinal function in mice treated with moderate doses of CB-5083 for 5 months and documented the absence of permanent ocular toxicity. Conclusions Altogether, these findings suggest that long-term use of CB-5083 by moderate doses is safe and can improve VCP disease-associated muscle pathology. Our results provide translationally relevant evidence that VCP inhibitors could be beneficial in the treatment of VCP disease.</abstract>", "<keyword>Equivalent circuit<sep>Grid<sep>Steady state (chemistry)<sep>Three-phase<sep>AC power<sep>Controller (irrigation)<sep>Point (geometry)<sep>Energy storage<sep>Power-flow study<sep>Voltage<sep>Voltage droop<sep>Power control<sep>Diesel generator<sep>Electric power system<sep>Distributed generation<sep>Power flow<sep>Inverter<sep>Leverage (statistics)<sep>Resilience (materials science)<sep>Electrical impedance<sep>Fuel efficiency<sep>Microgrid<sep>Component (thermodynamics)<sep>Network topology<sep>Diesel fuel<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Transformer<sep>Control theory (sociology)</keyword><title>A QSTS Simulation Tool Using Equivalent Circuit Inverter Models for Permanently Isolated Nanogrids<sep>A Resilience Evaluation Concept for Permanently Islanded Military Nanogrids<sep>Modeling and Simulation of Short-Circuit Faults in Inverter-Based Microgrids Using Steady-State Equivalent Circuits<sep>Demonstration of Quasi-Static Time-Series Power Flow Studies for Islanded Three-Phase Microgrids<sep>Optimal Power Flow for Unbalanced Three-Phase Microgrids Using an Interior Point Optimizer<sep>Military Diesel Microgrids: Design, Operational Challenges, Energy Storage Integration<sep>Voltage Balancing of Grid-Forming Inverters in Unbalanced, Islanded Microgrids<sep>Voltage Balancing Capability of Grid-Forming Inverters<sep>Generalized Formulation of Steady-State Equivalent Circuit Models of Grid-Forming Inverters<sep>Quasi-Static Time-Series Power Flow Solution for Islanded and Unbalanced Three-Phase Microgrids<sep>Interphase Power Flow Control via Single-Phase Elements in Distribution Systems</title><abstract>This paper demonstrates a tool for quasi-static time series (QSTS) simulation for permanently isolated military nanogrids using steady-state equivalent circuit inverter models. Grid-forming and grid-following inverters are connected to PV generation and energy storage systems. The tool facilitates planning and operation of such grids by analyzing steady-state operation, fuel consumption, energy endurance, and faults in grid-forming and grid-following inverter modes. The equivalent inverter models are computationally efficient and well suited for rapid studies requiring QSTS with varying irradiance conditions and loads.<sep>The ongoing electrification of warfare intensifies the U.S. military's reliance on electrical energy. Military nanogrids are small, permanently islanded, highly mobile, electrical systems, with a generation capacity less than 25 kW. This paper proposes a resilience evaluation concept with metrics for mobile military nanogrids. The proposed metrics evaluate resilience against a disruption in primary generation, loss of a distribution component, loss of fuel supply, and electrical faults. A method for classifying distribution networks into radial, loop, or mesh topologies is also presented. The intent is to quantitatively evaluate a military nanogrid's resilience and drive the design of future systems with enhanced resilience.<sep>This work proposes the modeling and simulation of short-circuit faults in inverter-based microgrids using steady-state equivalent models. A grid-forming inverter is modeled as a voltage source with equivalent positive- and negative-sequence impedances, while a grid-following inverter is represented with a current source injecting constant power. Both equivalent circuit models are developed based on voltage and current control loops and current limiters of detailed models designed for time-domain simulation. The accuracy of the proposed models is validated by comparing short-circuit voltages and currents computed using OpenDSS to those obtained from time-domain simulation using PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results showed that the steady-state equivalent circuit models precisely reproduce the response of the detailed models and improve computational efficiency.<sep>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution systems led to an increase in interest in islanded microgrids. As a consequence, new simulation tools are required by utilities to leverage the benefits of these new system configurations. In this context, this work presents quasi-static time-series (QSTS) power flow studies using a method that utilizes the solution mechanism from OpenDSS. The system modeling and power flow solution are conducted using OpenDSS, simplifying the implementation of islanded microgrid studies. This paper implements and demonstrates the application of our proposed method in OpenDSS. Specifically, voltage regulation and power and energy balance studies are carried out on EPRI ckt 5, which is based on a real-world distribution feeder.<sep>Optimal power flow (OPF) analysis enables the in-depth study and examination of islanded microgrid design and operation. The development of the analysis framework, including modeling, formulating, and selecting effective OPF solvers, however, is a nontrivial task. As a result, this paper presents a tutorial on an OPF modeling framework, offering a mathematical model that can be readily implemented using established open-source software tools such as OpenDSS, Pyomo, and IPOPT. The framework is versatile, capable of representing single-phase and unbalanced three-phase islanded microgrids. Various inverter models, such as those of grid forming and following equipped with their operating characteristics, can be incorporated. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated in studying the OPF of single-phase and three-phase microgrids.<sep>This paper introduces military microgrids, including their unique design considerations and common issues associated with these permanently islanded systems. They are powered by diesel generators, typically over-sized for their loads, inducing wet stacking, which reduces efficiency and damages the generator's engine. There is a point of diminishing returns for investment in larger energy storage ratings, at which further storage increases will reduce fuel consumption, but in a non-economical manner. The paper recommends that the optimally sized energy storage system eliminates wet stacking, improves efficiency by only operating at optimal outputs, and increases fuel consumption less than 2%. An example of the methodology is demonstrated on a model of a U.S. military combat outpost in Afghanistan using a weekly load profile.<sep>In microgrids, unbalanced loads (single or multi-phase) can create voltage imbalances. In grid-connected mode, the utility grid helps balance the microgrid load voltages. However, in an islanded mode of operation of unbalanced microgrids without a synchronous machine, a three-leg grid-forming (GFM) inverter with only a positive-sequence controller cannot maintain balanced load voltages. But, the presence of certain transformer configurations can improve the voltage-balancing capability of GFMs. An in-depth analysis of sequence networks is essential to understand an unbalanced power system. This paper explains the coupling of sequence networks in an unbalanced system and estimates the sequence currents required to balance the voltage at the load terminals. Simulating simplified test systems, this paper demonstrates a grid-forming inverter with decoupled controllers and a grounding transformer together in an islanded microgrid mimic the voltage balancing capability of a grid-connected microgrid, resulting in negligible unbalanced voltage.<sep>The objective of this paper is to analyze and identify the range of voltage balancing capability of grid-forming inverters serving three-phase unbalanced loads. These inverters are designed to compensate for voltage imbalance by controlling the negative-sequence components of voltage and current. However, the magnitude of the negative-sequence current an inverter can supply is limited by its relatively low rated current. Moreover, it becomes more challenging to estimate the amount of current needed for an unbalanced load when the inverter is interfaced using a delta-wye grounded interconnection transformer. Therefore, we investigate the range of negative-sequence current the inverter can supply and derive formulas to determine the minimum inverter’s capacity required to compensate for voltage imbalance while supplying unbalanced loads connected through a delta-wye grounded transformer. The proposed formulas can be used to estimate the capacity of an inverter in lieu of detailed analyses and electromagnetic transient simulations. The proposed equation is implemented in small and large scale microgrid systems and validated using a detailed model developed in PSCAD/EMTDC.<sep>Abstract: This work proposes positive- and negative-sequence equivalent circuits of grid-forming inverters for steady-state analysis. The proposed models are especially attractive for performing long-duration voltage regulation analysis and short-circuit studies involving grid-forming inverters. Our proposed equivalent circuit models are based on the inverter’s voltage and current control loops in the αβ and dq frames. For this reason, they operate according to prescribed control functions and specified impedances (i.e., filter impedance, current limiter block, virtual admittance block, and PI/PR controller block). The equivalent circuit model accuracy is validated by comparing system steady-state voltage and current responses obtained by detailed time-domain models in PSCAD/EMTDC to those by the equivalent circuit models implemented in steady-state load flow program (e.g., OpenDSS). Two distinct control structures implemented in the αβ and dq frames are used for the validation. Single line-to-ground and line-to-lineto-ground faults are simulated in a small islanded microgrid as well as the IEEE 34-node test feeder. Fault impedances varying from 0 to 5 ohms are simulated. We show that the equivalent models precisely replicate the steady-state response of the detailed time-domain models.<sep>Recent advances in inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs) allow microgrids to operate in grid-connected and islanded modes with ease. However, determining a steady-state load flow solution of a real-world unbalanced and islanded three-phase microgrid remains a challenge. Existing methods are either unsuitable, labor-intensive or computationally demanding for a long-term analysis of islanded microgrids. To address these issues, we propose a practical solution framework that employs externally-updated system frequency, power quantities, and droop characteristics governing the voltage and phase angle of DERs in every iteration as inputs to an off-the-shelf open-source multi-phase, multi-wire, unbalanced power flow software tool to solve an islanded-microgrid power flow. Using our framework, users only need to implement a set of droop equations and update system variables. The power flow solution is accomplished entirely by an off-the-shelf power flow tool, e.g., OpenDSS. Our proposed framework can model a microgrid of any arbitrary configuration and operating condition. We demonstrate and validate the proposed method's efficacy by comparing its results with those modeled using a time-domain simulation with PSCAD/EMTDC. Finally, an example of a quasi-static time-series study is presented to better illustrate the application of such a tool.<sep>The capability of routing power from one phase to another, interphase power flow (IPPF) control, has the potential to improve power systems efficiency, stability, and operation. To date, existing works on IPPF control focus on unbalanced compensation using three-phase devices. An IPPF model is proposed for capturing the general power flow caused by single-phase elements. The model reveals that the presence of a power quantity in line-to-line single-phase elements causes an IPPF of the opposite quantity; line-to-line reactive power consumption causes real power flow from leading to lagging phase while real power consumption causes reactive power flow from lagging to leading phase. Based on the model, the IPPF control is proposed for line-to-line single-phase power electronic interfaces and static var compensators (SVCs). In addition, the control is also applicable for the line-to-neutral single-phase elements connected at the wye side of delta-wye transformers. Two simulations on a multimicrogrid system and a utility feeder are provided for verification and demonstration. The application of IPPF control allows single-phase elements to route active power between phases, improving system operation and flexibility. A simple IPPF control for active power balancing at the feeder head shows reductions in both voltage unbalances and system losses.</abstract>", "<keyword>Stability (learning theory)<sep>Topology (electrical circuits)<sep>Grid<sep>Inductor<sep>Inductance<sep>Limiting<sep>Fault (geology)<sep>Scalability<sep>AC power<sep>Controller (irrigation)<sep>Voltage<sep>Low voltage<sep>Converters<sep>Electric power system<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Decoupling (probability)<sep>Leakage inductance<sep>Popularity<sep>Bridge (graph theory)<sep>Circuit breaker<sep>Fault current limiter<sep>Electrical impedance<sep>Microgrid<sep>Electromagnetic interference<sep>Network topology<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Transformer<sep>Control theory (sociology)</keyword><title>Low-Voltage dc System Building Blocks: Integrated Power Flow Control and Short Circuit Protection<sep>Continuous Full Order Model of Triple Active Bridge Converter<sep>Protection Framework for Low Voltage DC Grids<sep>Power Flow Decoupling Controller for Triple Active Bridge Based on Fourier Decomposition of Transformer Currents<sep>Partially Rated Power Flow Control Converter Modeling for Low-Voltage DC Grids<sep>Zero Voltage Switching Criteria of Triple Active Bridge Converter<sep>Decentralized Plug-and-Play Protection Scheme for Low Voltage DC Grids<sep>Fault Protection and Coordinated Controls of Power Flow Controller in a Flexible DC Grid<sep>Design criteria of solid‐state circuit breaker for low‐voltage microgrids<sep>Unbalanced Voltage/Power Control in Bipolar DC Distribution Grids Using Power Flow Controller<sep>PHIL-based Impedance Measurement for Electromagnetic Stability Analysis of Grid-following Converters<sep>A Multiactive Bridge Converter With Inherently Decoupled Power Flows<sep>Coordination Control of Power Flow Controller and Hybrid DC Circuit Breaker in MVDC Distribution Networks</title><abstract>Low-voltage direct current (LVdc) systems are a promising technology for systems with a high penetration of renewable sources and storage that operate with bidirectional power flow. In this article, a fundamental building block for LVdc is presented for different applications, such as charge controllers, voltage regulation in street-lighting systems, and current limiters in meshed dc grids. The developed building block integrates a solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) and partially rated power flow control converter (PFCC) capable of achieving the given control objectives with extremely high system efficiency and full short circuit protection.<sep>With the rising popularity of the power electronic based systems with integrated energy storage, the multi-port isolated converter topologies are gaining popularity. In contemporary literature, the triple active bridge (TAB) converter is the most popular among these topologies. However, the TAB was not yet described with the continuous-time full-order model. In this paper, the continuous-time full-order model of the TAB converter is derived. The derived model is validated with the measurement of the control-to-output transfer functions. The derived model can provide useful insights into the operation of the converter and can be used for controller design.<sep>This paper presents a protection framework for low voltage dc grids, which segments these grids into zones and tiers according to their fault current potential and provided protection. Furthermore, the technology and applications of different protection devices are examined. It is demonstrated that the utilization of fast fault interruption and fault limiting inductors are vital for the protection of low voltage dc grids. Moreover, a design of a solid-state circuit breaker is presented, and this devices is experimentally verified. The experimental results showed that the total time for the detection and interruption of faults can be lower than 1 μs with solid-state protection devices.<sep>This paper proposes a power flows decoupling controller for the triple active bridge converter. The controller is based on a full-order continuous-time model of the TAB converter derived using the generalized average modelling (GAM) technique. GAM uses the Fourier series expansion to decompose the state-space variables into two components, which represent the active power and the reactive power. The controller uses the active power components of the transformer currents to decouple the active power flows between converter ports. Additionally, the implementation of the decoupling controller in the digital domain is detailed in the paper. The decoupling performance of the proposed controller is validated in a hardware experiment.<sep>Scalable and robust low-voltage direct current (LVdc) distribution networks require solutions, allowing flexible power flow control and reliable short-circuit protection. In this paper, the continuous full-order large- and small-signal models of a partially rated power flow control converter (PFCC) are derived utilizing the generalized averaging method. The large-signal model of the PFCC is coupled with a model of the LVdc grid. Due to the state-space representation, the combined model of the PFCC and the LVdc grid is suitable for easy algorithmization, and efficient simulation. These advantages make them essential tools for studying and optimizing of scalable LVdc systems with decentralized power flow control based on the PFCC. The PFCC models provide insights into controller design and stability analysis. The models are experimentally validated, and the functionality of the PFCC is demonstrated in a laboratory-scale microgrid.<sep>Triple active bridge (TAB) as an isolated multiport converter is a promising integrated energy system for smart grids or electric vehicles. This article aims to derive and analyze zero voltage switching (ZVS) regions of TAB, in which both switching losses are reduced, and electromagnetic interference issues are mitigated. In the proposed closed-form solution of ZVS criteria, parameters such as the parasitic capacitance of the switches, the leakage inductance of the transformer, the switching frequency, the port voltage, the phase-shift inside and between the full-bridges are all taken into account. The analysis shows how the five degrees of freedom can be used to maintain ZVS operation in various operating points. The analysis and derived closed-form ZVS criteria are experimentally verified using a laboratory prototype. The derived analytical ZVS criteria are a powerful tool to study and optimize the operation of TAB converters.<sep>Since the voltages and currents in dc grids do not have a natural zero-crossing, the protection of these grids is more challenging than the protection of conventional ac grids. Literature presents several unit and non-unit protection schemes that rely on communication, or knowledge about the system’s topology and parameters in order to achieve selective protection in these grids. However, communication complicates fast fault detection and interruption, and a system’s parameters are subject to uncertainty and change. This paper demonstrates that, in low voltage dc grids, faults propagate fast through the grid and interrupted inductive currents commutate to non-faulted sections of the grid, which both can cause circuit breakers in non-faulted sections to trip. A decentralized plug-and-play protection scheme is proposed that ensures selectivity via an augmented solid-state circuit breaker topology and by utilizing the proposed time-current characteristic. It is experimentally shown that the proposed scheme provides secure and selective fault interruption for radial and meshed low voltage dc grids under various conditions.<sep>This paper analyses the fault current characteristics of a flexible DC grid with a power flow controller (PFC) and proposes a coordinated control method for suppression of fault currents between the PFC and the DC circuit breaker (DCCB). The equivalent circuits of the PFC during different stages of the DC fault are analyzed. Moreover, the influence of the output voltage of the PFC on the fault current is studied. After that, the current suppression characteristics of the current limiting reactor (CLR) and PFC are investigated. Due to the output voltage of the PFC can be flexibly adjusted during the DC fault, the fault current can be suppressed significantly by adjusting the output voltage of the PFC when the DC fault is detected. This paper adopts a bang-bang control for PFC during the fault. Finally, a simulation model was built in Matlab/Simulink to verify the fault current characteristics of the DC grid containing the PFC, and the coordinated control of the PFC was verified.<sep>Solid-state circuit breakers (SSCB) show great promise to become the key element in the protection of low-voltage direct current microgrids. SSCBs operate in the microsecond range and employ semi-conductor devices that have strict safe operation area limits. Therefore, the design of the SSCB needs to consider the effects of fault detection delays and semi-conductor safe operation area limitations. This paper derives SSCB design criteria that consider the effect of different detection methods with different detection delays under varying system constraints. The design space is investigated in a sensitivity analysis, which provides insights into the operation boundaries of SSCB and explains how a combination of fault detection methods can reduce the SSCB size. The insights from the theoretical and sensitivity analysis are used to propose an SSCB design flowchart. SSCB prototype is developed and tested in different scenarios under nominal grid voltage and current. The derived design constraints can be used for efficient SSCB design and also to evaluate the effects of different protection schemes on the required SSCB size.<sep>For a bipolar meshed DC distribution grid, the number of DC transmission lines is greater than converter stations. Therefore, the power flow control (PFC) needs to be introduced to increase the control flexibility of the DC grid. Besides, the unbalanced power between the positive and negative poles in bipolar DC girds may result in a large unbalanced current in the neutral line, causing the pole voltages to deviate from the rated value and increasing the power losses in the bipolar network. This paper aims to realize the PFC of DC distribution grids while suppressing the unbalanced voltage/power of the positive and negative poles. The application of a series parallel-connected PFC in bipolar DC distribution systems is investigated. Subsequently, the relationship between the output voltage of the PFC and the unbalanced power of the bipolar DC distribution grids is derived under the two different control modes of PFC. The simulation model is built in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that when constant voltage control is applied, the PFC can suppress the unbalanced current in the transmission line, and it can also realize flexible control of the DC power flow.<sep>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) have a complex internal structure and internally use controllers and output filters with different dynamics. The increasing number of IBRs in modern power systems has led to a redefinition of the power system stability criteria, as it is necessary to assess stability under faster dynamics and disturbances imposed by the IBRs. A new class of power system stability called electromagnetic stability (EM) is introduced to evaluate the effects driven by the IBRs on power system stability. One of the major problems when assessing EM stability is the fact that the internal structure of the IBRs control loops is typically not available to those assessing the stability. The impedance-based stability assessment approach proves to be an effective way of evaluating the system’s EM stability, because no detailed knowledge of the internal structure of the IBR’s hardware or its control is needed in this case. In this paper, we illustrate the application of a 100- kVA commercial power hardware in the loop (PHIL) system to measure the output impedance of a grid-following converter (GFL) and the impedance of the voltage-source converter acting as a grid to which the GFL is connected.<sep>Multiactive bridge converters (MAB) have become a widely-researched candidate for the integration of multiple renewable sources, storage, and loads for a variety of applications, from robust smart grids to more-electric aircraft. Connecting multiple dc ports reduces power conversion stress, improves efficiency, reduces material billing, and increases power density. However, the power flows between the ports of an MAB converter are magnetically coupled via the high-frequency (HF) transformer, making it difficult to control. This article presents an MAB converter configuration with a rigid voltage source on the magnetizing inductance of the transformer resulting in inherently decoupled power flows. As a result, the configuration allows independent power flow control tuning of the rest of the ports. The theory behind the power flow decoupling of the proposed MAB configuration is analyzed in detail using a reduced-order model. A 2-kW, 100-kHz Si-C-based four-port MAB converter laboratory prototype is built and tested, showing completely decoupled control loops with fast transient response regardless of their control bandwidths. The proposed configuration therefore makes the operation and design of the MAB family of converters much more feasible for any number of ports and precludes the need for a high-performance dynamic decoupling controller.<sep>The two main challenges of medium voltage direct current (MVDC) distribution network are the flexible control of power flow (PF) and fault protection. In this paper, the power flow controller (PFC) is introduced to regulate the PF and inhibit the fault current during the DC fault. The coordination strategy of series-parallel PFC (SP-PFC) and hybrid DC circuit breaker (DCCB) is proposed. By regulating the polarity and magnitude of SP-PFC output voltage during the fault, the rising speed of fault current can be suppressed so as to reduce the breaking current of hybrid DCCB. The access mode of SP-PFC to the MVDC distribution network and its topology are analyzed, and the coordination strategy between SP-PFC and hybrid DCCB is investigated. Moreover, the emergency control and bypass control strategies of SP-PFC are developed. On this basis, the mathematical model of SP-PFC in different fault stages is derived. With the equivalent model of SP-PFC, the fault current of the MVDC distribution network can be calculated accurately. A simulation model of the MVDC distribution network containing SP-PFC is established in MATLAB/Simulink. The fault current calculation result is compared with the simulation result, and the effectiveness of the proposed coordination strategy is verified.</abstract>", "<keyword>Concordance<sep>Bovine respiratory disease<sep>Outbreak<sep>Antibiotic resistance<sep>Genome<sep>Drug resistance<sep>Isolation (microbiology)<sep>Broth microdilution<sep>Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis<sep>Minimum inhibitory concentration<sep>Phylogenetic tree<sep>Clade<sep>Pasteurella<sep>Gene<sep>Antimicrobial<sep>Pasteurella multocida<sep>Typing</keyword><title>Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida in Bovine Respiratory Disease<sep>Comparison of whole-genome sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis for characterizing relationships in Mannheimia haemolytica<sep>Genetic characterization of susceptible and multi-drug resistant Mannheimia haemolytica isolated from high-risk stocker calves prior to and after antimicrobial metaphylaxis<sep>Concordance of disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and whole‐genome sequencing for determination of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of <i>Mannheimia haemolytica</i></title><abstract>The bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida contribute to bovine respiratory disease (BRD), which is often managed with antimicrobials. Antimicrobial resistance in these bacteria has been rare, but extensively drug-resistant strains have recently become common. Routine antimicrobial use may be driving this resistance. Resistance spread is caused in part by propagation of strains harboring integrative conjugative elements. The impact of antimicrobial resistance on treatment outcomes is not clear, but clinical observations suggest that response to first treatment has decreased over time, possibly because of resistance. Clinicians should consider antimicrobial resistance when designing BRD treatment and control programs.<sep>It has long been presumed that cattle developing BRD tend to become sick from their own native strains of Mannheimia haemolytica. Previous work by others has demonstrated that the diversity of Mannheimia haemolytica, as evaluated by PFGE, within a pen of cattle remains high during BRD outbreaks. Prior to the development of whole genome sequencing (WGS), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) had been considered the gold standard for characterizing outbreaks of bacterial disease. Recently, many studies from the human literature have raised question regarding the accuracy of PFGE as WGS has become more widely implemented. Studies investigating Acinetobacter baumanii, Clostridium difficile, and vancomycin resistant Enterococci outbreaks in hospitals have shown WGS to have superior discernment and more accurately classify strains when compared to PFGE. Considering the superiority of WGS in characterizing outbreaks in all of these species, if may be that relationships inferred in Mannheimia haemolytica based on PFGE could be inaccurate. It is therefore our goal to compare the discernment ability of PFGE and WGS for Mannheimia haemolytica isolates collected from beef cattle.<sep>Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) is a major threat to animal health and welfare in the cattle industry. Strains of Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh) that are resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials are becoming a major concern in the beef industry, as the frequency of isolation of these strains has been increasing. Mobile genetic elements, such as integrative conjugative elements (ICE), are frequently implicated in this rapid increase in multi-drug resistance. The objectives of the current study were to determine the genetic relationship between the isolates collected at arrival before metaphylaxis and at revaccination after metaphylaxis, to identify which resistance genes might be present in these isolates, and to determine if they were carried on an ICE. Twenty calves culture positive for Mh at arrival and revaccination were identified, and a total of 48 isolates with unique susceptibility profiles (26 from arrival, and 22 from revaccination) were submitted for whole-genome sequencing (WGS). A phylogenetic tree was constructed, showing the arrival isolates falling into four clades, and all revaccination isolates within one clade. All revaccination isolates, and one arrival isolate, were positive for the presence of an ICE. Three different ICEs with resistance gene modules were identified. The resistance genes aphA1, strA, strB, sul2, floR, erm42, tetH/R, aadB, aadA25, blaOXA-2, msrE, mphE were all located within an ICE. The gene bla-ROB1 was also present in the isolates, but was not located within an ICE.<sep>Abstract Background Extensive drug resistance (XDR) is an emerging concern with Mannheimia haemolytica , and a variety of testing methods are available for characterizing in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility. Objectives To compare the concordance among disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) for susceptibility testing of M. haemolytica before and after mass treatment using tulathromycin. Animals Forty‐eight M. haemolytica isolates collected from high‐risk beef stocker calves before and after mass treatment (metaphylaxis) using tulathromycin (Draxxin, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) given at the label dosage of 2.5 mg/kg body weight SC in the neck. Methods In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility was determined for all 48 isolates using disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and WGS. Concordance was calculated between pairs of susceptibility testing methods as follows: number of isolates classified identically by the 2 testing methods for each timepoint, divided by the number of isolates tested at that timepoint. Discordance was calculated as follows: number of isolates classified differently by the 2 testing methods for each timepoint, divided by the number of isolates tested at that timepoint. Results Concordance between testing methods ranged from 42.3% to 100%, depending on antimicrobial evaluated, timing of sample collection, and testing method used. Very major errors were identified in up to 7.7% of classifications whereas minor errors were seen in up to 50% of classifications depending on antimicrobial evaluated, timing of sample collection, and testing method used. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Our results show that discrepancies in the results of different susceptibility testing methods occur and suggest a need for greater harmonization of susceptibility testing methods.</abstract>", "<keyword>Social software engineering<sep>Personal software process<sep>Software<sep>Software development<sep>Legislation</keyword><title>Software Engineering: A Profession in Waiting</title><abstract>Ongoing efforts to make software development an engineering discipline will fail until we have legislation requiring that creators of certain types of software be licensed, establishing a licensing authority, and detailing the capabilities that a licensed developer must possess.</abstract>", "<keyword>Scaling<sep>Shearing (physics)<sep>Viscoplasticity<sep>Tension (geology)<sep>Viscoelasticity<sep>Isotropy<sep>Compression (physics)<sep>Delamination (geology)<sep>Surface finish<sep>Surface roughness<sep>Creep<sep>Paperboard<sep>Finite strain theory</keyword><title>A continuum damage model for creasing and folding of paperboard<sep>Out-of-plane uniaxial loading of paperboard: experimental procedure and evaluation<sep>A rate-dependent continuum model for rapid converting of paperboard</title><abstract>Abstract A continuum damage framework is proposed for modelling the delamination process occurring in paperboard during mechanical loading. The main application of interest is line creasing and subsequent line folding used in package forming. To adequately capture creasing and folding, a continuum damage framework that uses a single isotropic damage variable that evolves with the plastic strains associated with out‐of‐plane shearing is used. The damage evolution is calibrated against folding experiments for a specific reference mesh, and a simple scaling strategy is proposed to reduce the inherent mesh dependency. To highlight the potential of the proposed model, an illustrative 3D example is considered where a paperboard sheet is creased by two plates and folded to resemble the corner of a package.<sep>Abstract Development of three-dimensional continuum models for paperboard is an active field and the need for reliable measurements to calibrate and validate such models is evident. An experimental device and protocol for cyclic out-of-plane loading is developed. This loading sequence is present during converting operations of paperboard. The experimental tests reveals that the commonly observed soft initial non-linear response during out-of-plane compression is a structural effect that stems from the surface roughness rather than being an inherent material behavior. A gluing procedure, used to perform cyclic out-of-plane loading, is mitigating the effect of the surface roughness. Several novel cyclic loading experiments are performed, alternating between compression and tension which indicates that fiber bonds are not recovered in compression after they have been broken through delamination. Measurements also show that the transition in compression and tension is continuous, hence the use of a switch function present in a number of constitutive continuum models for paperboard is deemed questionable.<sep>A rate-dependent continuum model for paperboard is developed within a framework for finite strains and finite deformations. A multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into an elastic and an inelastic part is assumed. For the in-plane modes of deformation, viscoelasticity is introduced via a thermodynamically consistent generalization of the Maxwell formulation. The elastic transition between out-of-plane compression and out-of-plane tension is smooth, excluding the need for a switch function which is present in a number of existing paperboard models. The evolution of the inelastic part is modeled using two potential functions separating compression from shear and tension. To calibrate the material model, a set of experiments at different loading rates have been performed on single ply paperboard together with creep and relaxation tests for in-plane uniaxial tension. The model is validated by simulating two loading cases related to package forming, line-folding followed by subsequent force-relaxation and line-creasing during different operating velocities in conjunction with a creep study.</abstract>"]}

However, running a basic NMF analysis requires the installation of multiple tools and dependencies, along with a steep learning curve and computing time. To mitigate such obstacles, we developed ShinyButchR, a novel R/Shiny application that provides a complete NMF-based analysis workflow, allowing the user to perform matrix decomposition using NMF, feature extraction, interactive visualization, relevant signature identification, and association to biological and clinical variables. ShinyButchR builds upon the also novel R package ButchR, which provides new TensorFlow solvers for algorithms of the NMF family, functions for downstream analysis, a rational method to determine the optimal factorization rank and a novel feature selection strategy.<sep>Understanding the role of transcription and transcription factors in cellular identity and disease, such as cancer and autoimmunity, is essential. However, comprehensive data resources for cell line-specific transcription factor-to-target gene annotations are currently limited. To address this, we developed a straightforward method to define regulons that capture the cell-specific aspects of TF binding and transcript expression levels. By integrating cellular transcriptome and transcription factor binding data, we generated regulons for four common cell lines comprising both proximal and distal cell line-specific regulatory events. Through systematic benchmarking involving transcription factor knockout experiments, we demonstrated performance on par with state-of-the-art methods, with our method being easily applicable to other cell types of interest. We present case studies using three cancer single-cell datasets to showcase the utility of these cell-type-specific regulons in exploring transcriptional dysregulation. In summary, this study provides a valuable tool and a resource for systematically exploring cell line-specific transcriptional regulations, emphasizing the utility of network analysis in deciphering disease mechanisms.<sep>Background: Heart failure represents the end-stage of a range of diseases which adversely impact the heart muscle. The extent by which cellular and molecular mechanisms differ between myocardial diseases in heart failure remains incompletely understood. Methods: We performed isolation and droplet-based RNA-sequencing of 394 247 single nuclei from 103 explanted hearts from transplant and ventricular assist device recipients and 7 unused donor hearts without heart disease. After sample and nuclei level quality control, doublet removal and sample integration; principal component analysis and shared nearest neighbor clustering were used to identify distinct cell populations. Cell type composition and transcriptomic profiles were compared across donor hearts and 10 myocardial diseases (hypertrophic, dilated, ischemic, restrictive, arrythmogenic and non-compaction cardiomyopathy; rheumatic and congenital heart disease; cardiac amyloidosis and graft rejection; n=1-45/group). Results: We identified and manually annotated 14 distinct cell populations that were present across controls and myocardial diseases, including transcriptionally diverse subgroups of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes. Compared to controls, we observed disease-specific differences in cell populations with regards to composition, heterogeneity, and specific transcriptional profiles. Conclusions: Our results reveal differences in single cell profiles of individual heart muscle diseases compared to controls without heart disease.<sep>Splicing of genomic exons into mRNAs is a critical prerequisite for the accurate synthesis of human proteins. Genetic variants impacting splicing underlie a substantial proportion of genetic disease, but are challenging to identify beyond those occurring at donor and acceptor dinucleotides. To address this, various methods aim to predict variant effects on splicing. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achieve better results in predicting splice variants than other strategies.It has been unclear how best to integrate such process-specific scores into genome-wide variant effect predictors. Here, we use a recently published experimental data set to compare several machine learning methods that score variant effects on splicing. We integrate the best of those approaches into general variant effect prediction models and observe the effect on classification of known pathogenic variants.We integrate two specialized splicing scores into CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion; cadd.gs.washington.edu ), a widely used tool for genome-wide variant effect prediction that we previously developed to weight and integrate diverse collections of genomic annotations. With this new model, CADD-Splice, we show that inclusion of splicing DNN effect scores substantially improves predictions across multiple variant categories, without compromising overall performance.While splice effect scores show superior performance on splice variants, specialized predictors cannot compete with other variant scores in general variant interpretation, as the latter account for nonsense and missense effects that do not alter splicing. Although only shown here for splice scores, we believe that the applied approach will generalize to other specific molecular processes, providing a path for the further improvement of genome-wide variant effect prediction.</abstract>"], "negatives": ["<keyword>Germplasm<sep>Cas9<sep>Identity by descent<sep>Candidate gene<sep>Quantitative trait locus<sep>Polyploid<sep>Imputation (statistics)<sep>Polyphenol oxidase<sep>CRISPR<sep>Genome editing<sep>Cultivar<sep>Linkage disequilibrium<sep>Genome<sep>Ploidy<sep>Allele<sep>Population<sep>Common wheat<sep>Chromosome<sep>Genome evolution<sep>Locus (genetics)<sep>Haplotype<sep>Genotyping<sep>Retrotransposon<sep>Molecular breeding<sep>Gene</keyword><title>Gradual polyploid genome evolution revealed by pan-genomic analysis of Brachypodium hybridum and its diploid progenitors<sep>Genome Editing Tools for Potato Improvement<sep>Multi-target genome editing reduces polyphenol oxidase activity in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>L.) grains<sep>Identification and validation of a QTL for spikelet number on chromosome arm 6BL of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)<sep>Identification of a candidate gene for a QTL for spikelet number per spike on wheat chromosome arm 7AL by high-resolution genetic mapping<sep>Multi-target genome editing reduces polyphenol oxidase activity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grains<sep>Development of the Wheat Practical Haplotype Graph database as a resource for genotyping data storage and genotype imputation</title><abstract>Abstract Our understanding of polyploid genome evolution is constrained because we cannot know the exact founders of a particular polyploid. To differentiate between founder effects and post polyploidization evolution, we use a pan-genomic approach to study the allotetraploid Brachypodium hybridum and its diploid progenitors. Comparative analysis suggests that most B. hybridum whole gene presence/absence variation is part of the standing variation in its diploid progenitors. Analysis of nuclear single nucleotide variants, plastomes and k-mers associated with retrotransposons reveals two independent origins for B. hybridum , ~1.4 and ~0.14 million years ago. Examination of gene expression in the younger B. hybridum lineage reveals no bias in overall subgenome expression. Our results are consistent with a gradual accumulation of genomic changes after polyploidization and a lack of subgenome expression dominance. Significantly, if we did not use a pan-genomic approach, we would grossly overestimate the number of genomic changes attributable to post polyploidization evolution.<sep>The tetraploid and highly heterozygous potato serves as a staple food for billions of people worldwide. Genetic features of the potato make classical breeding strategies challenging because elite cultivars are vegetatively propagated to avoid the loss of optimal agronomic traits through allele segregation during sexual reproduction. Therefore, genome editing is a promising tool for both functional genomics and crop breeding through the efficient introduction of favorable alleles. In the past few years, the plant science community has successfully and extensively applied the powerful, precise, and versatile clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to modify genes of interest and confer new traits in crops, including potato. Until recently, CRISPR was most commonly used to generate knockout mutants, but new CRISPR technologies have emerged that can induce precise modifications in genomic loci of interest. In this chapter, we summarize the current knowledge of genome editing with a special focus on applications in potato. We describe the current CRISPR toolbox that can be applied to potato research and cultivar development, allowing the introduction of a large range of edits in almost any locus of interest. The current advances and challenges specific to potato molecular breeding are also discussed, including strategies to generate transgene-free edited plants. Finally, we review the traits that have been targeted so far and those of interest for future improvement, including pathogen resistance traits that could help meet current environmental challenges, according to international regulatory frameworks.<sep>SUMMARY Polyphenol oxidases (PPO) are dual activity metalloenzymes that catalyse the production of quinones. In plants, PPO activity may contribute to biotic stress resistance and secondary metabolism but is undesirable for food producers because it causes the discolouration and changes in flavour profiles of products during post-harvest processing. In wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), PPO released from the aleurone layer of the grain during milling results in the discolouration of flour, dough, and end-use products, reducing their value. Loss-of-function mutations in the PPO1 and PPO2 paralogous genes on homoeologous group 2 chromosomes confer reduced PPO activity in the wheat grain but limited natural variation and small intergenic distances between these genes complicates the selection of extremely low-PPO wheat varieties by recombination. In the current study, a CRISPR/Cas9 construct with one single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting a conserved copper binding domain was used to edit all seven PPO1 and PPO2 genes in the spring wheat cultivar ‘Fielder’. Five of the seven edited T 1 lines exhibited significant reductions in PPO activity, and T 2 lines had PPO activity up to 86.7% lower than wild-type controls. In the elite winter wheat cultivars ‘Guardian’ and ‘Steamboat’, which have five PPO1 and PPO2 genes, PPO activity was reduced by &gt;90% in both T 1 and T 2 lines. This study demonstrates that multi-target editing at late stages of variety development could complement selection for beneficial alleles in crop breeding programmes by inducing novel variation in loci inaccessible to recombination.<sep>To provide food security for a growing world population, it will be necessary to increase yields of staple crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Yield is a complex, polygenic trait influenced by grain weight and number, which are negatively correlated with one another. Spikelet number is an important determinant of grain number, but allelic variants impacting its expression are often associated with heading date, constraining their use in wheat germplasm that must be adapted for specific environments. Identification and characterization of genetic variants affecting spikelet number will increase selection efficiency through their deployment in breeding programs. In this study, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome arm 6BL for spikelet number was identified and validated using an association mapping panel, a recombinant inbred line population, and seven derived heterogeneous inbred families. The superior allele, QSn.csu-6Bb, was associated with an increase of 0.248 to 0.808 spikelets per spike across multiple environments that varied for mean spikelet number. Despite epistatic interactions between QSn.csu-6B and three other loci (WAPO-A1, VRN-D3, and PPD-B1), genotypes with a greater number of superior alleles at these loci consistently exhibit higher spikelet number. The frequency of superior alleles at these loci varies among winter wheat varieties adapted to different latitudes of the US Great Plains, revealing opportunities for breeders to select for increased spikelet number using simple molecular markers. This work lays the foundation for the positional cloning of the genetic variant underlying the QSn.csu-6B QTL to strengthen our understanding of spikelet number determination in wheat.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11032-022-01288-7.<sep>A high-resolution genetic map combined with haplotype analyses identified a wheat ortholog of rice gene APO1 as the best candidate gene for a 7AL locus affecting spikelet number per spike. A better understanding of the genes controlling differences in wheat grain yield components can accelerate the improvements required to satisfy future food demands. In this study, we identified a promising candidate gene underlying a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on wheat chromosome arm 7AL regulating spikelet number per spike (SNS). We used large heterogeneous inbred families ( > 10,000 plants) from two crosses to map the 7AL QTL to an 87-kb region (674,019,191-674,106,327 bp, RefSeq v1.0) containing two complete and two partial genes. In this region, we found three major haplotypes that were designated as H1, H2 and H3. The H2 haplotype contributed the high-SNS allele in both H1 × H2 and H2 × H3 segregating populations. The ancestral H3 haplotype is frequent in wild emmer (48%) but rare (~ 1%) in cultivated wheats. By contrast, the H1 and H2 haplotypes became predominant in modern cultivated durum and common wheat, respectively. Among the four candidate genes, only TraesCS7A02G481600 showed a non-synonymous polymorphism that differentiated H2 from the other two haplotypes. This gene, designated here as WHEAT ORTHOLOG OF APO1 (WAPO1), is an ortholog of the rice gene ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (APO1), which affects spikelet number. Taken together, the high-resolution genetic map, the association between polymorphisms in the different mapping populations with differences in SNS, and the known role of orthologous genes in other grass species suggest that WAPO-A1 is the most likely candidate gene for the 7AL SNS QTL among the four genes identified in the candidate gene region.<sep>Introduction Polyphenol oxidases (PPO) are dual activity metalloenzymes that catalyse the production of quinones. In plants, PPO activity may contribute to biotic stress resistance and secondary metabolism but is undesirable for food producers because it causes the discolouration and changes in flavour profiles of products during post-harvest processing.

Loss-of-function mutations in the PPO1 and PPO2 paralogous genes on homoeologous group 2 chromosomes confer reduced PPO activity in the wheat grain. However, limited natural variation and the proximity of these genes complicates the selection of extremely low-PPO wheat varieties by recombination. The goal of the current study was to edit all copies of PPO1 and PPO2 to drive extreme reductions in PPO grain activity in elite wheat varieties. Results A CRISPR/Cas9 construct with one single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting a conserved copper binding domain was used to edit all seven PPO1 and PPO2 genes in the spring wheat cultivar ‘Fielder’. Five of the seven edited T1 lines exhibited significant reductions in PPO activity, and T2 lines had PPO activity up to 86.7% lower than wild-type. The same construct was transformed into the elite winter wheat cultivars ‘Guardian’ and ‘Steamboat’, which have five PPO1 and PPO2 genes. In these varieties PPO activity was reduced by &amp;gt;90% in both T1 and T2 lines. In all three varieties, dough samples from edited lines exhibited reduced browning. Discussion This study demonstrates that multi-target editing at late stages of variety development could complement selection for beneficial alleles in crop breeding programs by inducing novel variation in loci inaccessible to recombination.<sep>To improve the efficiency of high-density genotype data storage and imputation in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we applied the Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) tool. The Wheat PHG database was built using whole-exome capture sequencing data from a diverse set of 65 wheat accessions. Population haplotypes were inferred for the reference genome intervals defined by the boundaries of the high-quality gene models. Missing genotypes in the inference panels, composed of wheat cultivars or recombinant inbred lines genotyped by exome capture, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), or whole-genome skim-seq sequencing approaches, were imputed using the Wheat PHG database. Though imputation accuracy varied depending on the method of sequencing and coverage depth, we found 92% imputation accuracy with 0.01× sequence coverage, which was slightly lower than the accuracy obtained using the 0.5× sequence coverage (96.6%). Compared to Beagle, on average, PHG imputation was ∼3.5% (P-value < 2 × 10-14) more accurate, and showed 27% higher accuracy at imputing a rare haplotype introgressed from a wild relative into wheat. We found reduced accuracy of imputation with independent 2× GBS data (88.6%), which increases to 89.2% with the inclusion of parental haplotypes in the database. The accuracy reduction with GBS is likely associated with the small overlap between GBS markers and the exome capture dataset, which was used for constructing PHG. The highest imputation accuracy was obtained with exome capture for the wheat D genome, which also showed the highest levels of linkage disequilibrium and proportion of identity-by-descent regions among accessions in the PHG database. We demonstrate that genetic mapping based on genotypes imputed using PHG identifies SNPs with a broader range of effect sizes that together explain a higher proportion of genetic variance for heading date and meiotic crossover rate compared to previous studies.</abstract>", "<keyword>Antibiotics<sep>Gestational age<sep>Neonatal intensive care unit<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Necrotizing enterocolitis</keyword><title>Early Use of Antibiotics Is Associated with a Lower Incidence of Necrotizing Enterocolitis in Preterm, Very Low Birth Weight Infants: The NEOMUNE-NeoNutriNet Cohort Study</title><abstract>To determine whether commencement of antibiotics within 3 postnatal days in preterm, very low birth weight (VLBW; ≤1500 g) infants is associated with the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).Preplanned statistical analyses were done to study the association between early antibiotic treatment and later NEC development, using the NEOMUNE-NeoNutriNet cohort of VLBW infants from 13 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in 5 continents (n = 2831). NEC incidence was compared between infants who received early antibiotics and those who did not, with statistical adjustments for NICU, gestational age, birth weight, sex, delivery mode, antenatal steroid use, Apgar score, and type and initiation of enteral nutrition.The incidence of NEC was 9.0% in the group of infants who did not receive early antibiotics (n = 269), compared with 3.9% in those who did receive early antibiotics (n = 2562). The incidence remained lower in the early antibiotic group after stepwise statistical adjustments for NICU (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.94, P < .05) and other potential confounders (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.47; P < .0001).In this large international cohort of preterm VLBW infants, a small proportion of infants did not receive antibiotics just after birth, and these infants had a higher incidence of NEC. It is important to better understand the role of such variables as time, type, and duration of antibiotic treatment on NEC incidence, immune development, gut colonization, and antibiotic resistance in the NICU.</abstract>", "<keyword>Studio<sep>Cleaner production<sep>Measure (data warehouse)<sep>Poison control<sep>Global-warming potential<sep>Technology CAD<sep>Scopus<sep>Natural hazard<sep>Computer-aided manufacturing<sep>Bin<sep>Modernization theory<sep>Descriptive statistics<sep>Waste material<sep>Incineration<sep>Construction industry<sep>Municipal solid waste<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>Hazardous waste<sep>Demolition waste<sep>Experiential learning<sep>Boundary value problem<sep>Thematic analysis<sep>Call for bids<sep>Resource efficiency<sep>Hazard<sep>Nyström method<sep>Sustainability<sep>CAD<sep>Displacement (psychology)<sep>Legislation<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Circular economy<sep>Reusability<sep>Internally displaced person<sep>Incentive<sep>Green infrastructure<sep>Convolutional neural network<sep>Developing country<sep>Key (lock)<sep>Displaced person<sep>Learning cycle<sep>Procurement<sep>Project commissioning<sep>Design studio<sep>Life-cycle assessment<sep>Buckling<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Greenhouse gas<sep>Climate change<sep>Embodied energy<sep>Human factors and ergonomics<sep>Reuse<sep>Originality<sep>Corporate governance<sep>MEDLINE<sep>Empirical research<sep>Demolition<sep>Supply chain<sep>Systematic review<sep>Sustainable development<sep>Computer Aided Design<sep>Carbon nanotube<sep>Sorting<sep>Publishing<sep>Waste disposal<sep>Emergency management<sep>Conceptual framework<sep>Deconstruction (building)<sep>Learning design<sep>Popularity<sep>Construction waste</keyword><title>Exploring the Role of CAD and its Application in Design Education<sep>Designers’ Reflections on Two Methods of Using Design Media for Learning Design Processes<sep>Input-Process-Output of decision-making framework during bushfire<sep>Planning to Enhance Student Learning Outcomes on Innovation Design Projects<sep>Factors affecting construction waste management streams in Australia<sep>The classification of construction waste material using a deep convolutional neural network<sep>Beyond early self-evacuation from bushfires: factors influencing non-evacuation of at-risk communities<sep>Size Dependent Buckling Analysis of a FG-CNTRC Microplate of Variable Thickness under Non-Uniform Biaxial Compression<sep>Critical technical design principles for maximizing the reuse of building components<sep>Circular Economy in Africa’s Built Environment: A Conceptual Bibliometric Analysis<sep>Comparative sustainability evaluation of two engineered wood-based construction materials: Life cycle analysis of CLT versus GLT<sep>Policy interventions for disaster-related internal displacement in Australia<sep>Hazardous building materials threaten circular economy and sustainable outcomes<sep>Drivers of Applying Ecological Modernization to Construction Waste Minimization in New South Wales Construction Industry<sep>Chemicals of concern in construction and demolition waste fine residues: A systematic literature review<sep>Construction Waste Management in Nigeria Using the 3R Principle of the Circular Economy<sep>Establishing the limitations of sustainable construction in developing countries: a systematic literature review using PRISMA<sep>Life cycle sustainability assessment of alternative green roofs – A systematic literature review<sep>Contributions of the circular economy to the UN sustainable development goals through sustainable construction<sep>Composite building materials and construction and demolition waste (C&amp;DW): ecotoxicological perspectives<sep>An Assessment of Material Waste Disposal Methods in the Nigerian Construction Industry<sep>A mixed method for measuring incompatibilities between manufacturing approaches and off-site construction<sep>Making the case for policy interventions in disaster governance and management in Australia to better support internally displaced people</title><abstract>Computer-Aided Design and Applications is an international journal on the applications of CAD and CAM.

Despite this, there has been an increase in residents moving into high-risk bushfire areas. This study aimed to develop a framework that could guide householder decision-making regarding self-evacuation during bushfires by identifying the incentives that encourage early evacuation. The study used a qualitative approach and 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted with residents in the southeast part of New South Wales; a region hardest hit during the 2019–20 summer bushfire season. Thirteen potential incentives that motivate self-evacuation were identified. The framework provides valuable insights into how incentives could influence residents’ decision-making during bushfires. In addition, it serves as a useful reference for policymakers, fire services and emergency management organisations when creating effective ways to encourage early self-evacuation and, ultimately, reduce injury and fatality.<sep>Design studio is the central learning environment for students in design schools. For the major design project, various topic selections can lead to dissimilar design journeys. This module was taught for the first time at one of the international universities in China campus in the 2015 spring semester. After completing the teaching, students suggested that more critiques help them to acquire design knowledge and manage their time more effectively. We adopted their suggestions. However, the learning outcomes in 2016 were not as good as those of the preceding year. To address this issue, we proposed Kolb’s experiential learning cycle as a framework to develop assessment strategies for various design stages, and we argued that assessment strategies designed based on this framework enhance student learning outcomes. We illustrated how the stages of Kolb’s model can be incorporated into the major design project and results presented in the paper.<sep>Construction and Demolition Waste (C&DW) represents a significant proportion of industrial waste going to landfill. The aim of this research was to determine the current factors affecting C&DW management on construction sites in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. In order to achieve this aim, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 C&D practitioners and stakeholders, interview data were analysed using Nvivo software. Key factors that underlined waste management processes on construction sites were identified. These include; identifying economic values of diverted material, potential for onsite sorting, knowledge, experience and training of site operatives, a need for tenders to include accurate predictions of waste management costs and the identification of improved methods of C&DW collection and disposal. This research reveals the key factors identified by the industry specialists in NSW that would potentially hinder C&DW management targets. Accordingly, the findings are valuable to managers and environmental stakeholders concerned with C&DW management.<sep>The management of Construction and Demolition Waste (C&DW) is complex and adds significantly to the overall life cycle cost of projects. On site waste sorting using technologies that automatically identify different materials has the potential to assist in classifying C&DW and reduce costs. The aim of this research was to design and describe a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify 7 typical C&DW classifications (both single and mixed disposal) using digital images of waste deposited in a construction site bin (artefact). This approach emulated authentic construction site scenarios where on-site sorting is difficult. A novel design science methodology was used. The experiments delivered 94% accuracy, classifying both single and mixed C&DW. This accuracy is important on projects where on-site sorting is attempted, as in practice bin contamination escalates project costs and reduces C&DW diversion from landfill. To illustrate potential of the research the innovative artefact is incorporated within a hypothetical case study describing its use in a circular C&DW business model.<sep>Abstract Bushfire is a devastating natural hazard. Contrary to bushfire policy on catastrophic fires, some householders prefer to stay and defend their properties. In addition, more frequent destructive events have been predicted because of climate change. To date, little attention has been paid to factors concerning why householders decide not to evacuate, especially for at-risk communities. Recent bushfire fatalities underscore the need to understand the factors influencing decision-making among residents in at-risk communities. This study addresses this imperative by identifying factors through a systematic literature review. Out of 142 articles extracted from the Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1999 – 2020, 32 were found relevant. Based on the rationalism classification of knowledge in psychology, these were categorized into information, social, protection, and operational factors. The factors may inform further studies involving predictors of residents’ non-evacuation from bushfire hazards. In addition, the significant factors can be leveraged towards early self-evacuation, which could reduce bushfire fatalities and mental health impacts among the residents.<sep>This paper combines third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) and modified couple stress theory (MCST) with the principle of total potential energy to analyze the size-dependent buckling behavior of a functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) rectangular microplate of variable thickness subject to non-uniform biaxial compression when resting on an elastic medium. To determine the thickness qualities of the material, the extended rule of mixture was applied. In the context of microplate buckling in the presence of small length scale effects, the three kinds of Carbon Nanotube (CNT) distribution—(a) UD, (b) FG-O, and (c) FG-X—were used and compared. The equations governing various combinations of simply supported or clamped boundary conditions have been solved using the differential quadrature method (DQM). The correctness and precision of the solutions have been compared to another study. A numerical study was conducted to examine the dependence of buckling load on several parameters, including percentage change of thickness, length scale parameter, nonuniform edge loads, boundary conditions, volume percentage of the CNTs, CNT distribution, and elastic medium parameter. The results<sep>The reuse of building components plays a pivotal role in construction and demolition waste reduction. Reuse can be a part of the deconstruction process resulting in cost and environmental benefits. Several studies have identified various design principles that facilitate the deconstruction process. These may consequently maximize the reusability of building components. However, the extent to which these measures are effective is unclear. This study examines the importance of these principles in relation to the reusability of building components. A questionnaire survey investigating design principles based on previous studies was administered to building industry professionals including civil engineers, architects and demolition contractors. It was designed to determine the degree of suitability and relevance of the design principles to the practice of reuse. Over 170 responses were collected and analysed using a number of statistical approaches including ANOVA and factor analysis to identify critical technical design principles (TDPs) and to determine the potential relationships among them. Nine TDPs were identified as highly significant for the practice of reuse. Statistically significant differences between the opinions<sep>Abstract As an alternative to the linear economy concept, the circular economy (CE) is growing in popularity among researchers, governments, and organisations. It is a waste-elimination concept that takes, creates, uses, and regenerates materials. Although the CE concept has been adopted in a variety of industries and countries, its application in Africa, particularly in the built environment sector, is still in its early stages. A lack of adequate research on the subject could be one of the reasons for the slow uptake in the built environment. In this context, the study provides an overview of publications focusing on CE in Africa’s built environment from 2001 to 2021. Through the Web of Science database, this study identifies various key topics and CE implementation methods in Africa using bibliometric analysis. The findings show that 92 publications in Africa focused on CE and the built environment over a 20-year period. Using the VOS viewer software, data analysis focused on the document type, year of publication, journal distribution, top authors, most cited publication, and keywords.

Previous research dealing with wood or engineering wood's energy requirements compared to reinforced concrete and steel structures has shown that embodied energy and embodied carbon is significantly lower in wood-based construction. This study has assessed the environmental impact and costs of glued laminated timber (GLT) or cross-laminated timber (CLT). Hardwood and softwood variants of both GLT and CLT were considered. We compared the life cycle costs (LCC) of these alternatives to discover the lowest cost. The comparative results indicated that GLT has higher emissions in Global warming potential (GWP), Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE), Land Use (LUP), and Ozone layer depletion (OLD), while CLT has higher impact in Human-Toxicity Potential (HTP), Fossil Depletion Potential (FDP). The results indicated that using CLT significantly reduces embodied energy by 40%. However, a comparison of costs showed that CLT is 7% more expensive than GLT. Establishing which material performs best based on environmental and economic criteria thus required further analysis. Thus,<sep>Abstract It is projected that internal displacement of populations in the aftermath of natural hazards will occur more frequently due to climate change [1]. However, to date, 35 nations have implemented policy or legal protections at a national level to plan for displacement or to protect the rights of internally displaced people (IDPs) [2]. While no cohesive national strategy for internal displacement has been developed in Australia, a thematic analysis of climate change, disasters, and emergency management policies was conducted to determine if Australian policy acknowledges the issue of internal displacement or plans for its effects. The study found that Australian policy fails to recognise the needs of IDPs and the threat of displacement risk. The failure of national governments to implement policy and legislation on internal displacement has the potential to undermine the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and stifle the progression of international initiatives such as the Sendai Framework and the Paris Climate Agreement. Furthermore, the lack of recognition for the issue at the governmental level contributes to disaster displacement<sep>Construction materials can be reused and recycled in many ways to reduce waste and contribute to sustainable construction. While the construction industry is moving toward a sustainable low-carbon future that will see an increase in reused and recycled building materials, buildings that contain hazardous construction materials are difficult to deconstruct for future reuse. To understand the extent that hazardous materials impede inclusion of construction materials in the circular economy, we used a method for calculating value for money, separate to cost, to assess the value found in existing building materials. Using the demolition of the McMullin Building in Newcastle, Australia as a case study, this chapter assesses the differences in value between a hypothetical best potential value of building materials and the actual value of the materials extracted after demolition in the case study scenario. This chapter reports on the demolition process, providing quantities and types of materials recovered, as well as their final outcomes. A value-first approach made it clear reusing existing materials rather than recycling, may have offered multiple beneficial<sep>The application of ecological modernization (EM) (to delink industry growth from environmental damage) to minimize construction waste has not been explored within the construction industry in general, and the New South Wales (NSW) construction industry in particular. This study seeks to identify the drivers of applying EM to construction waste minimisation (CWM) in the industry. Also, to determine the CWM measures that are critical for each of the drivers. A survey was adopted in this study to target stakeholders engaged in the delivery of construction projects in NSW from design to completion. The survey was selected to reach a large number of respondents within a manageable period. A pilot study was conducted to ensure the reliability of the research design before a full-scale data collection was launched. The data from 240 valid responses was analysed using factor analysis, relative importance index and descriptive statistics. The results revealed five important drivers for EM’s application to CWM. These are agents of change, government policies, supply chain dynamics, skill-building and technological innovations. The CWM measures<sep>Despite the increasing use of chemical additives in construction and their potential threat to the environment and human health, many C&DW studies lack a comprehensive view of chemicals of concern (COC) in C&DW. This study systematically reviewed published studies from 2010 to August 2021 using a keyword search methodology to explore COC in C&DW fine residues based on 73 articles identified from 5 prominent databases. Results show that trace/heavy metals (As, Cr, Cu, Cd, and Pb) as well as high concentrations of toxic gasses (methane, hydrogen sulphide and mercury vapour) have been reported in landfills. Besides, organic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and brominated flame retardants have been found in landfill leachates in the Netherlands and widely detected in landfill leachates in Sweden, Japan, and Canada. The potential of these contaminants to cause health complications has also been reported. Carcinogenicity, liver and kidney damage, cumulative damage, neurological disorders and foetal damage were reported as associated health implications of exposure to COC from C&DW. A waste disposal lens was used<sep>AbstractThe construction industry makes a significant contribution to the growth and development of any country through infrastructure development. However, the industry also generates huge amounts of waste, and these inadvertently impact on the environment and deplete finite raw materials. This underscores the need for the industry to adopt effective waste management strategies. Several such strategies including the reduce, reuse, and recycle (or 3Rs) principle have been discussed in the literature and employed in many developed and developing nations. The 3R principle forms the basis of the circular economy (CE), which has gained traction as a potential strategy to minimize construction material waste. The question of whether the concept of the CE can be adopted as a waste management approach in Nigeria continues to pique the interest of researchers and industry practitioners. Through a concurrent triangulation design in a cross-sectional survey, this study assessed waste management strategies adopted at the construction phase by Nigerian building construction firms (NBCF). A structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from 243 firms, while semi-structured interviews<sep>Purpose Establishing a more sustainable built environment is an increasing global concern for the construction industry. Despite the intrinsic and extrinsic obstacles the stakeholders face, huge efforts are required to transition to a smooth, sustainable construction (SC) practice. This study identifies and discusses cogent obstacles to SC in developing nations. Design/methodology/approach The Preferred Reporting Item for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) approach was employed to establish research work in SC for developing countries. The databases used were Scopus and Web of Science. Meta-analysis of keywords was analysed thematically. The initial broad search returned 8,420 publications which were filtered and reviewed in-depth to fit the aim of the study, produced only 21 relevant publications from the years 2000–2021. Findings The four identified themes of obstacles to SC in developing countries are as follows: construction professional training and education, clients' attitudes and awareness, construction industries' culture and capacity and governments' regulation, policies and economy. The key barriers identified from the meta-analysis include inadequate training and education amongst construction professionals, poor execution of sustainability ethics,<sep>There is general agreement on the importance of green roofs as ways of reducing GHG emissions, reducing overall costs and improving sustainability in urban areas. This systematic literature review highlights life cycle sustainability assessment as an essential criterion to evaluate green roofs. A bibliometric analysis was used to quantitatively review relevant literature. The Scopus database was chosen as a bibliographic database of academic publications. Thes period of search started from 2003 and final search was conducted on February 15, 2023. Based on further in-depth reading, 88 publication records which met the selection criteria, including 74 papers and 14 conference papers. Researchers from the United States contributed almost 31 % of the documents. We evaluated leading studies in this field and discussed assessment method, system boundaries and research gaps through a critical literature review and a systematic search review. Finally, we propose a framework and identify a gap and future research. The environmental aspect of green roofs have received more attention than economic issues. We found that most economic evaluations of green roofs<sep>The construction industry plays an essential role in a country's economic growth. The industry has been criticised for activities and processes that generate high volumes of waste, whilst obstructing sustainable development goal (SDGs) targets. The circular economy (CE) increases waste minimisation by keeping materials and resources in a closed loop. This concept has continued to gain positive traction as a potential solution to achieve sustainable development. The authors argue that contextualising the circular economy (CE) as part of the discourse towards implementing the United Nations (UN) SDGs Agenda 2030 is crucial for managing the increasing amounts of waste generated by the construction industry. This paper provides a framework that establishes a detailed relationship between the SDGs, construction waste management and the CE to direct future sustainable development research, policies, and innovations. The study adopted a narrative literature review methodology. Scopus and Web of Science were scoured for relevant literature published between 2015 and 2021. Initially 65 articles were identified with this number being reduced to 24 following a detailed inspection of their<sep>The impacts of composite building materials and construction and demolition waste (C&DW) on the natural environment have been immense and challenging to predict with conventional measures. Ecotoxicological bioassays are suitable techniques to study the cumulative and/or synergistic impacts of environmental contaminants that cannot be detected by traditional methods. A review of experiments on different composite materials used in building construction has shown typical ecotoxic impacts on different animals and plants. The lifecycle of buildings was studied including the extraction of raw materials and manufacturing processes, specific components of building materials and additive chemicals, which portrayed potential toxicity to the environment. Composite concrete materials, wood treatment chemicals, adhesives, resins and polychlorinated composites are notable examples with known ecotoxic effects. However, studies attempting to ascertain the impacts of mixed materials such as unsorted fractions of C&DWs have been very rare and superficial. An experimental study was conducted to investigate the ecotoxicological effects of C&DW residual fines from material recovery facilities using two terrestrial plant species (Sinapis alba and Triticum aestivum) and the earthworm, Eisenia<sep>The construction industry is faced with many challenges, among which is waste management. Aside from the fact that wastage contributes to time and cost overrun, it also has environmental implications in the form of pollution. However, the industry has the capacity to effectively manage waste, from generation to disposal. All stages of the management process are important, but scholars and governments have provided the final step, being disposal, unabated attention in order to ensure effective management. Potential waste disposal methods, including incineration, burning, landfilling, recycling, reuse, open dumping, pyrolysis, and shredding have emerged from the literature around the globe. Despite various waste minimisation and sustainable disposal options that are available, construction material waste is still increasing in Nigeria, while disposal remains a major issue for firms and government. Therefore, this study assesses disposal methods among construction firms to determine whether there is a relationship between their practices towards waste disposal. The research followed a concurrent triangulation design in a cross sectional survey, while data were collected via a convergent parallel mixed methods.<sep>Purpose The purpose of this research is to measure incompatibilities between the manufacturing approaches (MA) used by the manufacturing industries, and those used for the off-site construction (OSC) of buildings. The aim is to explore which of these approaches could be integrated into OSC in a precise manner as viewed by architects as well as how this might occur. Design/methodology/approach An empirical research and empirical cycle (EC) was adopted as a methodological framework to measure incompatibilities. A combination of quantitative and qualitative mixed methods was explored through a literature-based case study of prefabricated houses and cars, nine real-life projects built by the second author's research team and the first-named author's practical experiences of leading these projects, based on a logic framework derived from the authors’ reflections of their architectural practices. Findings The findings quantitatively present the incompatibilities between cars (automobile bodies) and prefabricated houses. Design-related aspects have the most potential for integration (42.3% increment). The key lessons were identified as specific design philosophies and related guidelines for architects. Research limitations/implications The findings<sep>Purpose Policy is key for effective displacement governance in times of crises and in response and recovery. Therefore, this study assessed if Australian climate, disaster and emergency management policies provide effective mechanisms for governing displacement crises and areas where current approaches could be improved. Design/methodology/approach This study assessed 18 national and state-level disaster, emergency and climate change management frameworks to determine if best practice displacement governance themes were reflected in policy documents. Deductive thematic analysis was undertaken using Braun and Clarke’s six-phase method. Findings Issues of displacement are reflected in policies analysed in this study. However, current policy frameworks need to be equipped to comprehensively address the housing requirements of displaced people or provide long-term initiatives. Approaches are focused on crisis management rather than pre-emptively planning for displacement response and recovery. Therefore, Australia has not exercised national responsibility for displaced people appropriately. Research limitations/implications Disaster displacement is an under-researched area of Australian scholarship and disaster management policy and practice. Therefore, this paper has practical implications in so far as it draws attention</abstract>", "<keyword>Gingival recession<sep>Annotation<sep>Protein Data Bank<sep>Ribozyme<sep>RNA recognition motif<sep>RNA<sep>RNA editing<sep>Gene<sep>Cytosol<sep>Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB)<sep>RNA-binding protein<sep>Transfer RNA<sep>Cleave<sep>DNA<sep>Deoxyribozyme<sep>Enzyme<sep>Motif (music)<sep>Connective tissue<sep>RNA splicing</keyword><title>MODOMICS: An Operational Guide to the Use of the RNA Modification Pathways Database<sep>RRMdb—an evolutionary-oriented database of RNA recognition motif sequences<sep>MODOMICS: a database of RNA modifications and related information. 2023 update<sep>DNAmoreDB, a database of DNAzymes<sep>Bilaminar Technique with Coronally Advanced Flap and Cryopreserved Human Amniotic Membrane in the Treatment of Gingival Recessions<sep>DNAzymeBuilder, a web application for <i>in situ</i> generation of RNA/DNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes<sep>MODOMICS: a database of RNA modification pathways. 2021 update<sep>Matching tRNA modifications in humans to their known and predicted enzymes</title><abstract>MODOMICS is an established database of RNA modifications that provides comprehensive information concerning chemical structures of modified ribonucleosides, their biosynthetic pathways, the location of modified residues in RNA sequences, and RNA-modifying enzymes.

MODOMICS is available at http://www.genesilico.pl/modomics.<sep>RNA-recognition motif (RRM) is an RNA-interacting protein domain that plays an important role in the processes of RNA metabolism such as the splicing, editing, export, degradation, and regulation of translation. Here, we present the RNA-recognition motif database (RRMdb), which affords rapid identification and annotation of RRM domains in a given protein sequence. The RRMdb database is compiled from ~57 000 collected representative RRM domain sequences, classified into 415 families. Whenever possible, the families are associated with the available literature and structural data. Moreover, the RRM families are organized into a network of sequence similarities that allows for the assessment of the evolutionary relationships between them.<sep>Abstract The MODOMICS database was updated with recent data and now includes new data types related to RNA modifications. Changes to the database include an expanded modification catalog, encompassing both natural and synthetic residues identified in RNA structures. This addition aids in representing RNA sequences from the RCSB PDB database more effectively. To manage the increased number of modifications, adjustments to the nomenclature system were made. Updates in the RNA sequences section include the addition of new sequences and the reintroduction of sequence alignments for tRNAs and rRNAs. The protein section was updated and connected to structures from the RCSB PDB database and predictions by AlphaFold. MODOMICS now includes a data annotation system, with ‘Evidence’ and ‘Estimated Reliability’ features, offering clarity on data support and accuracy. This system is open to all MODOMICS entries, enhancing the accuracy of RNA modification data representation. MODOMICS is available at https://iimcb.genesilico.pl/modomics/.<sep>Abstract Deoxyribozymes, DNA enzymes or simply DNAzymes are single-stranded oligo-deoxyribonucleotide molecules that, like proteins and ribozymes, possess the ability to perform catalysis. Although DNAzymes have not yet been found in living organisms, they have been isolated in the laboratory through in vitro selection. The selected DNAzyme sequences have the ability to catalyze a broad range of chemical reactions, utilizing DNA, RNA, peptides or small organic compounds as substrates. DNAmoreDB is a comprehensive database resource for DNAzymes that collects and organizes the following types of information: sequences, conditions of the selection procedure, catalyzed reactions, kinetic parameters, substrates, cofactors, structural information whenever available, and literature references. Currently, DNAmoreDB contains information about DNAzymes that catalyze 20 different reactions. We included a submission form for new data, a REST-based API system that allows users to retrieve the database contents in a machine-readable format, and keyword and BLASTN search features. The database is publicly available at https://www.genesilico.pl/DNAmoreDB/.<sep>Gingival recessions are usually treated with surgical therapies which involve the use of connective tissue autograft in order to thicken the gingival tissue. This has an important biological repercussion on patients since they will have surgical wounds in two different oral cavity sites. In this case report, we offer an alternative technique for the treatment of a Miller class I gingival recession. A 40-year-old female patient has been treated with a combination of bilaminar and coronally advance flap techniques to cover a Miller class I gingival recession with addition of cryopreserved human amniotic membrane. The human amniotic membrane has been employed to thicken the keratinized tissue. The human amniotic membrane in combination with bilaminar and coronally advance flap techniques has produced aesthetically and functionally satisfying results, covering completely the gingival recession and restoring the natural colour and thickness of the gingiva. Bilaminar technique with coronally advanced flap and cryopreserved human amniotic membrane is a valid alternative in treating Miller class I and II gingival recessions and reduce the biological morbidity of a double intervention.<sep>Nucleic acid cleaving DNAzymes are versatile and robust catalysts that outcompete ribozymes and protein enzymes in terms of chemical stability, affordability and ease to synthesize. In spite of their attractiveness, the choice of which DNAzyme should be used to cleave a given substrate is far from obvious, and requires expert knowledge as well as in-depth literature scrutiny. DNAzymeBuilder enables fast and automatic assembly of DNAzymes for the first time, superseding the manual design of DNAzymes. DNAzymeBuilder relies on an internal database with information on RNA and DNA cleaving DNAzymes, including the reaction conditions under which they best operate, their kinetic parameters, the type of cleavage reaction that is catalyzed, the specific sequence that is recognized by the DNAzyme, the cleavage site within this sequence, and special design features that might be necessary for optimal activity of the DNAzyme. Based on this information and the input sequence provided by the user, DNAzymeBuilder provides a list of DNAzymes to carry out the cleavage reaction and detailed information for each of them, including the expected yield, reaction products and optimal reaction conditions. DNAzymeBuilder is a resource to help researchers introduce DNAzymes in their day-to-day research, and is publicly available at https://iimcb.genesilico.pl/DNAzymeBuilder.<sep>Abstract The MODOMICS database has been, since 2006, a manually curated and centralized resource, storing and distributing comprehensive information about modified ribonucleosides. Originally, it only contained data on the chemical structures of modified ribonucleosides, their biosynthetic pathways, the location of modified residues in RNA sequences, and RNA-modifying enzymes. Over the years, prompted by the accumulation of new knowledge and new types of data, it has been updated with new information and functionalities. In this new release, we have created a catalog of RNA modifications linked to human diseases, e.g., due to mutations in genes encoding modification enzymes. MODOMICS has been linked extensively to RCSB Protein Data Bank, and sequences of experimentally determined RNA structures with modified residues have been added. This expansion was accompanied by including nucleotide 5′-monophosphate residues. We redesigned the web interface and upgraded the database backend. In addition, a search engine for chemically similar modified residues has been included that can be queried by SMILES codes or by drawing chemical molecules. Finally, previously available datasets of modified residues, biosynthetic pathways, and RNA-modifying enzymes have been updated. Overall, we provide users with a new, enhanced, and restyled tool for research on RNA modification. MODOMICS is available at https://iimcb.genesilico.pl/modomics/.<sep>tRNA are post-transcriptionally modified by chemical modifications that affect all aspects of tRNA biology. An increasing number of mutations underlying human genetic diseases map to genes encoding for tRNA modification enzymes. However, our knowledge on human tRNA-modification genes remains fragmentary and the most comprehensive RNA modification database currently contains information on approximately 20% of human cytosolic tRNAs, primarily based on biochemical studies. Recent high-throughput methods such as DM-tRNA-seq now allow annotation of a majority of tRNAs for six specific base modifications. Furthermore, we identified large gaps in knowledge when we predicted all cytosolic and mitochondrial human tRNA modification genes. Only 48% of the candidate cytosolic tRNA modification enzymes have been experimentally validated in mammals (either directly or in a heterologous system). Approximately 23% of the modification genes (cytosolic and mitochondrial combined) remain unknown. We discuss these ‘unidentified enzymes’ cases in detail and propose candidates whenever possible. Finally, tissue-specific expression analysis shows that modification genes are highly expressed in proliferative tissues like testis and transformed cells, but scarcely in differentiated tissues, with the exception of the cerebellum. Our work provides a comprehensive up to date compilation of human tRNA modifications and their enzymes that can be used as a resource for further studies.</abstract>", "<keyword>Protein crystallization<sep>Protein subunit<sep>Product (mathematics)<sep>Bacteria<sep>Neutron<sep>Protease<sep>Crystal (programming language)<sep>Artificial neural network<sep>Proton<sep>Neutron diffraction<sep>Chlamydia trachomatis<sep>Proteases<sep>Crystallization<sep>Ligand (biochemistry)<sep>Superoxide dismutase<sep>Mechanism (biology)<sep>Manganese<sep>Enzyme</keyword><title>Perfect Crystals: microgravity capillary counterdiffusion crystallization of human manganese superoxide dismutase for neutron crystallography<sep>Direct detection of coupled proton and electron transfers in human manganese superoxide dismutase<sep>Revealing the atomic and electronic mechanism of human manganese superoxide dismutase product inhibition<sep>Cryotrapping peroxide in the active site of human mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase crystals for neutron diffraction<sep>BraggNet: integrating Bragg peaks using neural networks<sep>The structure of caseinolytic protease subunit ClpP2 reveals a functional model of the caseinolytic protease system from Chlamydia trachomatis</title><abstract>The NASA mission Perfect Crystals used the microgravity environment on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow crystals of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)-an oxidoreductase critical for mitochondrial vitality and human health. The mission's overarching aim is to perform neutron protein crystallography (NPC) on MnSOD to directly visualize proton positions and derive a chemical understanding of the concerted proton electron transfers performed by the enzyme. Large crystals that are perfect enough to diffract neutrons to sufficient resolution are essential for NPC. This combination, large and perfect, is hard to achieve on Earth due to gravity-induced convective mixing. Capillary counterdiffusion methods were developed that provided a gradient of conditions for crystal growth along with a built-in time delay that prevented premature crystallization before stowage on the ISS. Here, we report a highly successful and versatile crystallization system to grow a plethora of crystals for high-resolution NPC.<sep>Abstract Human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a critical oxidoreductase found in the mitochondrial matrix. Concerted proton and electron transfers (CPETs) are used by the enzyme to rid the mitochondria of O 2 •− , a precursor to other harmful reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The mechanisms of CPET-utilizing enzymes are typically unknown due to the difficulties in detecting the protonation states of specific residues and solvent molecules involved in catalysis while controlling the redox state of the enzyme. Here, neutron diffraction of redox-controlled MnSOD crystals revealed the all-atom structures of Mn 3+ SOD and Mn 2+ SOD delivering unique data on sites of differential protonation. A novel mechanism is proposed from the direct observation of glutamine deprotonation, the involvement of Tyr and His with altered pK a s, and three unusual strong-short hydrogen bonds that change with the oxidation state of the metal. Quantum calculations provide insight into the electronic modulation of the observed structures.<sep>Abstract Human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a crucial oxidoreductase that maintains the vitality of mitochondria by converting O 2 •− to O 2 and H 2 O 2 with proton-coupled electron transfers (PCETs). Since changes in mitochondrial H 2 O 2 concentrations are capable of stimulating apoptotic signaling pathways, human MnSOD has evolutionarily gained the ability to be highly inhibited by its own product, H 2 O 2 . A separate set of PCETs is thought to regulate product inhibition, though mechanisms of PCETs are typically unknown due to difficulties in detecting the protonation states of specific residues that coincide with the electronic state of the redox center. To shed light on the underlying mechanism, we combined neutron diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the product-bound, trivalent, and divalent states to reveal the all-atom structures and electronic configuration of the metal. The data identifies the product-inhibited complex for the first time and a PCET mechanism of inhibition is constructed.<sep>Structurally identifying the enzymatic intermediates of redox proteins has been elusive due to difficulty in resolving the H atoms involved in catalysis and the susceptibility of ligand complexes to photoreduction from X-rays. Cryotrapping ligands for neutron protein crystallography combines two powerful tools that offer the advantage of directly identifying hydrogen positions in redox-enzyme intermediates without radiolytic perturbation of metal-containing active sites. However, translating cryogenic techniques from X-ray to neutron crystallography is not straightforward due to the large crystal volumes and long data-collection times. Here, methods have been developed to visualize the evasive peroxo complex of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) so that all atoms, including H atoms, could be visualized. The subsequent cryocooling and ligand-trapping methods resulted in neutron data collection to 2.30 Å resolution. The P6122 crystal form of MnSOD is challenging because it has some of the largest unit-cell dimensions (a = b = 77.8, c = 236.8 Å) ever studied using high-resolution cryo-neutron crystallography. The resulting neutron diffraction data permitted the visualization of a dioxygen species bound to the MnSOD active-site metal that was indicative of successful cryotrapping.<sep>Neutron crystallography offers enormous potential to complement structures from X-ray crystallography by clarifying the positions of low- Z elements, namely hydrogen. Macromolecular neutron crystallography, however, remains limited, in part owing to the challenge of integrating peak shapes from pulsed-source experiments. To advance existing software, this article demonstrates the use of machine learning to refine peak locations, predict peak shapes and yield more accurate integrated intensities when applied to whole data sets from a protein crystal. The artificial neural network, based on the U-Net architecture commonly used for image segmentation, is trained using about 100 000 simulated training peaks derived from strong peaks. After 100 training epochs (a round of training over the whole data set broken into smaller batches), training converges and achieves a Dice coefficient of around 65%, in contrast to just 15% for negative control data sets. Integrating whole peak sets using the neural network yields improved intensity statistics compared with other integration methods, including k -nearest neighbours. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that neural networks can learn peak shapes and be used to integrate Bragg peaks. It is expected that integration using neural networks can be further developed to increase the quality of neutron, electron and X-ray crystallography data.<sep>Chlamydia trachomatis (ct) is the most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide and the leading cause of preventable blindness. Caseinolytic proteases (ClpP) from pathogenic bacteria are attractive antibiotic targets, particularly for bacterial species that form persister colonies with phenotypic resistance against common antibiotics. ClpP functions as a multisubunit proteolytic complex, and bacteria are eradicated when ClpP is disrupted. Although crucial for chlamydial development and the design of agents to treat chlamydia, the structures of ctClpP1 and ctClpP2 have yet to be solved. Here, we report the first crystal structure of full-length ClpP2 as an inactive homotetradecamer in a complex with a candidate antibiotic at 2.66 Å resolution. The structure details the functional domains of the ClpP2 protein subunit and includes the handle domain, which is integral to proteolytic activation. In addition, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy probed the dynamics of ClpP2, and molecular modeling of ClpP1 predicted an assembly with ClpP2. By leveraging previous enzymatic experiments, we constructed a model of ClpP2 activation and its interaction with the protease subunits ClpP1 and ClpX. The structural information presented will be relevant for future rational drug design against these targets and will lead to a better understanding of ClpP complex formation and activation within this important human pathogen.</abstract>", "<keyword>Fibrosis<sep>Senescence<sep>Leptin receptor<sep>Biliary cirrhosis<sep>Biliary tract<sep>Steatohepatitis<sep>Melatonin<sep>Perilipin<sep>Inflammation<sep>Alcoholic liver disease<sep>Extracellular<sep>Vesicle<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Liver injury<sep>Primary biliary cirrhosis<sep>Monoamine oxidase A<sep>Cholestasis<sep>Knockout mouse<sep>Cholangiocyte<sep>Pancreas<sep>Calcitonin gene-related peptide<sep>Cirrhosis<sep>microRNA<sep>Liver fibrosis<sep>Fatty liver<sep>Hepatic stellate cell<sep>Extracellular vesicles<sep>Stem cell<sep>Steatosis<sep>Gulf war<sep>Monoamine oxidase<sep>Enterochromaffin cell<sep>Ethanol<sep>Leptin<sep>Galanin<sep>Exosome<sep>Pinealectomy<sep>Secretin</keyword><title>Correction to: Knockout of α-calcitonin gene-related peptide attenuates cholestatic liver injury by differentially regulating cellular senescence of hepatic stellate cells and cholangiocytes<sep>Secretin/secretin receptor signaling mediates biliary damage and liver fibrosis in early‐stage primary biliary cholangitis<sep>Secretin/secretin receptor signaling mediates biliary damage and liver fibrosis in early-stage primary biliary cholangitis<sep>Exposure to Gulf war illness-related chemicals exacerbates alcohol- induced liver damage in rodents<sep>Leptin Enhances Hepatic Fibrosis and Inflammation in a Mouse Model of Cholestasis<sep>Pinealectomy or light exposure exacerbates biliary damage and liver fibrosis in cholestatic rats through decreased melatonin synthesis<sep>Modulation of the Tryptophan Hydroxylase 1/Monoamine Oxidase‐A/5‐Hydroxytryptamine/5‐Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 2A/2B/2C Axis Regulates Biliary Proliferation and Liver Fibrosis During Cholestasis<sep>Knockout of α-calcitonin gene-related peptide attenuates cholestatic liver injury by differentially regulating cellular senescence of hepatic stellate cells and cholangiocytes<sep>Amelioration of Ductular Reaction by Stem Cell Derived Extracellular Vesicles in MDR2 Knockout Mice via Lethal-7 microRNA<sep>Amelioration of Ductular Reaction by Stem Cell Derived Extracellular Vesicles in MDR2 Knockout Mice via Lethal‐7 microRNA<sep>Targeting Galanin Receptor Signaling as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy for the Treatment of Fatty Liver Disease<sep>Mo1430 – The Proliferative Activity of Cholangiocytes is Regulated by Micrornas Carried in Extracellular Vesicles Secreted from Other Cholangiocytes<sep>Mo1428 – Role of the Aanat/Melatonin/Mt1/Mt2/Per-1 Axis in the Regulation of Biliary Damage and Liver Fibrosis in Cholestatic Mice<sep>Secretin/Secretin Receptor (Sct/SR) Signaling Promotes Biliary Senescence and Liver Fibrosis During Alcoholic Liver Disease</title><abstract>An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.<sep>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) primarily targets cholangiocytes and is characterized by liver fibrosis and biliary proliferation.

Secretin/secretin receptor signaling mediates biliary damage and liver fibrosis in early-stage primary biliary cholangitis.<sep>Abstract Gulf War Illness (GWI) describes a series of symptoms suffered by veterans of the Gulf war consisting of cognitive, neurological and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Two chemicals associated with GWI are the insecticide permethrin (PER) and the nerve gas prophylactic pyridostigmine-bromide (PB). In this study we assessed the effects of PER and PB exposure on pathology and subsequent alcohol (EtOH)-induced liver injury, and the influence of a macrophage depletor, PLX3397, on EtOH-induced liver damage in PER/PB- treated mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected daily with vehicle or PER/PB for 10 days, followed by 4 months recovery, then treatment with PLX3397 and a chronic-plus-single-binge EtOH challenge for 10 days. PER/PB exposure resulted in the protracted increase in liver transaminases in the serum and induced chronic low-level microvesicular steatosis and inflammation in GWI vs Naïve mice up to 4 months after cessation of exposure. Furthermore, prior exposure to PER/PB also resulted in exacerbated response to EtOH-induced liver injury, with enhanced steatosis, ductular reaction and fibrosis. The enhanced EtOH-induced liver damage in GWI-mice was attenuated by strategies designed to deplete macrophages in the liver. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to GWI-related chemicals may alter the liver’s response to subsequent ethanol exposure.<sep>Leptin is an adipokine with roles in food intake and energy metabolism through its actions on neurons in the hypothalamus. The role of leptin in obesity and cardiovascular disorders is well documented. However, its influence on liver conditions such as cholestasis is poorly understood. The effects of exogenous leptin and leptin-neutralizing antibody on biliary hyperplasia, hepatic fibrosis, and inflammation in the multidrug resistance protein 2 knockout (Mdr2KO) mouse model of cholestasis were assessed by quantifying markers specific for cholangiocytes, activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and cytokines. Serum and hepatic leptin were increased in Mdr2KO mice compared with FVB/NJ (FVBN) controls, and exogenous leptin enhanced biliary hyperplasia and liver fibrosis in Mdr2KO and FVBN mice. Leptin administration increased hepatic expression of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 and IL-6 in Mdr2KO mice. In contrast, leptin-neutralizing antibody reduced intrahepatic bile duct mass and decreased HSC activation in Mdr2KO mice compared with FVBN controls. Sex-related differences were noted, with female Mdr2KO mice having more leptin than males. In cholangiocytes and LX2 cells in vitro, leptin increased phosphorylated Akt and stimulated cell proliferation. Leptin receptor siRNA and inhibitors of Akt phosphorylation impaired leptin-induced cell proliferation and proinflammatory cytokines. The current data suggest that leptin is abnormally increased in cholestatic mice, and excess leptin increases ductular reaction, hepatic fibrosis, and inflammation via leptin receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in cholangiocytes and HSCs.<sep>Melatonin, a neuroendocrine hormone synthesized by the pineal gland and cholangiocytes, decreases biliary hyperplasia and liver fibrosis during cholestasis-induced biliary injury via melatonin-dependent autocrine signaling through increased biliary arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) expression and melatonin secretion, downregulation of miR-200b and specific circadian clock genes. Melatonin synthesis is decreased by pinealectomy (PINX) or chronic exposure to light. We evaluated the effect of PINX or prolonged light exposure on melatonin-dependent modulation of biliary damage/ductular reaction/liver fibrosis. Studies were performed in male rats with/without BDL for 1 week with 12:12 h dark/light cycles, continuous light or after 1 week of PINX. The expression of AANAT and melatonin levels in serum and cholangiocyte supernatant were increased in BDL rats, while decreased in BDL rats following PINX or continuous light exposure. BDL-induced increase in serum chemistry, ductular reaction, liver fibrosis, inflammation, angiogenesis and ROS generation were significantly enhanced by PINX or light exposure. Concomitant with enhanced liver fibrosis, we observed increased biliary senescence and enhanced clock genes and miR-200b expression in total liver and cholangiocytes. In vitro, the expression of AANAT, clock genes and miR-200b was increased in PSC human cholangiocyte cell lines (hPSCL). The proliferation and activation of HHStecs (human hepatic stellate cell lines) were increased after stimulating with BDL cholangiocyte supernatant and further enhanced when stimulated with BDL rats following PINX or continuous light exposure cholangiocyte supernatant via intracellular ROS generation. Conclusion: Melatonin plays an important role in the protection of liver against cholestasis-induced damage and ductular reaction.<sep>Serotonin (5HT) is a neuroendocrine hormone synthetized in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1) and monoamine oxidase (MAO-A) are the key enzymes for the synthesis and catabolism of 5HT, respectively. Previous studies demonstrated that 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5HTR)1A/1B receptor agonists inhibit biliary hyperplasia in bile-duct ligated (BDL) rats, whereas 5HTR2B receptor antagonists attenuate liver fibrosis (LF) in mice. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 5HTR2A/2B/2C agonists/antagonists in cholestatic models.While in vivo studies were performed in BDL rats and the multidrug resistance gene 2 knockout (Mdr2-/- ) mouse model of PSC, in vitro studies were performed in cell lines of cholangiocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). 5HTR2A/2B/2C and MAO-A/TPH1 are expressed in cholangiocytes and HSCs from BDL rats and Mdr2-/-- mice. Ductular reaction, LF, as well as the mRNA expression of proinflammatory genes increased in normal, BDL rats, and Mdr2-/-- mice following treatment 5HTR2A/2B/2C agonists, but decreased when BDL rats and Mdr2-/- mice were treated with 5HTR2A/2B/2C antagonists compared to BDL rats and Mdr2-/- mice, respectively. 5HT levels increase in Mdr2-/- mice and in PSC human patients compared to their controls and decrease in serum of Mdr2-/- mice treated with 5HTR2A/2B/2C antagonists compared to untreated Mdr2-/- mice. In vitro, cell lines of murine cholangiocytes and human HSCs express 5HTR2A/2B/2C and MAO-A/TPH1; treatment of these cell lines with 5HTR2A/2B/2C antagonists or TPH1 inhibitor decreased 5HT levels as well as expression of fibrosis and inflammation genes compared to controls.Modulation of the TPH1/MAO-A/5HT/5HTR2A/2B/2C axis may represent a therapeutic approach for management of cholangiopathies, including PSC.<sep>α-Calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP) is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide involved in several pathophysiological processes. α-CGRP is involved in the regulation of cholangiocyte proliferation during cholestasis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate if α-CGRP regulates bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis by using a α-CGRP knockout (α-CGRP-/-) mouse model. α-CGRP-/- and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to sham surgery or BDL for 7 days. Then, liver fibrosis and cellular senescence as well as the expression of kinase such as p38 and C-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) in mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway were evaluated in total liver, together with measurement of cellular senescence in cholangiocytes or hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). There was enhanced hepatic expression of Calca (coding α-CGRP) and the CGRP receptor components (CRLR, RAMP-1 and RCP) in BDL and in both WT α-CGRP-/- and BDL α-CGRP-/- mice, respectively. Moreover, there was increased CGRP serum levels and hepatic mRNA expression of CALCA and CGRP receptor components in late-stage PSC samples compared to healthy control samples. Depletion of α-CGRP reduced liver injury and fibrosis in BDL mice that was associated with enhanced cellular senescence of hepatic stellate cells and reduced senescence of cholangiocytes as well as decreased activation of p38 and JNK MAPK signaling pathway. Cholangiocyte supernatant from BDL α-CGRP-/- mice inhibited the activation and increased cellular senescence of cultured human HSCs (HHSCs) compared to HHSCs stimulated with BDL cholangiocyte supernatant. Taken together, endogenous α-CGRP promoted BDL-induced cholestatic liver fibrosis through differential changes in senescence of HSCs and cholangiocytes and activation of p38 and JNK signaling. Modulation of α-CGRP/CGRP receptor signaling may be key for the management of biliary senescence and liver fibrosis in cholangiopathies.<sep>Cholangiopathies are diseases that affect cholangiocytes, the cells lining the biliary tract. Liver stem cells (LSCs) are able to differentiate into all cells of the liver and possibly influence the surrounding liver tissue by secretion of signaling molecules. One way in which cells can interact is through secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are small membrane-bound vesicles that contain proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and cytokines. We evaluated the contents of liver stem cell-derived EVs (LSCEVs), compared their miRNA contents to those of EVs isolated from hepatocytes, and evaluated the downstream targets of these miRNAs. We finally evaluated the crosstalk among LSCs, cholangiocytes, and human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). We showed that LSCEVs were able to reduce ductular reaction and biliary fibrosis in multidrug resistance protein 2 (MDR2)-/- mice. Additionally, we showed that cholangiocyte growth was reduced and HSCs were deactivated in LSCEV-treated mice. Evaluation of LSCEV contents compared with EVs derived from hepatocytes showed a large increase in the miRNA, lethal-7 (let-7). Further evaluation of let-7 in MDR2-/- mice and human primary sclerosing cholangitis samples showed reduced levels of let-7 compared with controls. In liver tissues and isolated cholangiocytes, downstream targets of let-7 (identified by ingenuity pathway analysis), Lin28a (Lin28 homolog A), Lin28b (Lin28 homolog B), IL-13 (interleukin 13), NR1H4 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 4) and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B), are elevated in MDR2-/- mice, but treatment with LSCEVs reduced levels of these mediators of ductular reaction and biliary fibrosis through the inhibition of NF-κB and IL-13 signaling pathways. Evaluation of crosstalk using cholangiocyte supernatants from LSCEV-treated cells on cultured HSCs showed that HSCs had reduced levels of fibrosis and increased senescence. Conclusion: Our studies indicate that LSCEVs could be a possible treatment for cholangiopathies or could be used for target validation for future therapies.<sep>Cholangiopathies are diseases that affect cholangiocytes, the cells lining the biliary tract.

Galanin (Gal) is a neuropeptide with a role in food intake behavior and chronic upregulation of Gal is associated with increases in serum triglycerides, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance and hepatic steatosis. Targeting Gal receptor (GalR) signaling has been shown to have antifibrotic in models of cholestatic liver disease although the effects in NAFLD is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Gal/GalR axis in NAFLD and determined the effects of Gal Inhibition on the pathogenesis of NAFLD.C57Bl6 mice were fed a western diet (WD) consisting of high fat/high sugar/high cholesterol for a total of 16 weeks. At the 4 week time point, mice were treated with the GalR1/GalR2 antagonist, M40 (1 nmol, 3X per week for the duration of the experiment), or corresponding vehicle control. Serum and liver assays of Gal, triglycerides, and cholesterol were performed using commercially available kits. The expression of Gal, GalR1, GalR2, markers of steatosis (perilipin 2, PLIN2), biliary hyperplasia (cytokeratin 19, CK19), fibrosis (collagen type 1A1, Col1A1; α-smooth muscle actin, α-SMA) and inflammation (chemokine C-C motif ligand 2, CCL2; tumor necrosis factor-α, TNFα) by qPCR and immunostaining. Liver macrophages CD11b+ and CD68+ were quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Liver lipid droplets (LD) were stained with Oil Red O. In vitro, HepG2 cells were used to assess the effects of M40 on palmitate (PA)-induced LD formation.Gal was significantly increased in the serum and liver of WD-fed mice, with a corresponding increase in GalR1 and GalR2 expression. WD-mice exhibited significant increase in serum transaminases, triglycerides and cholesterol compared to control mice, and M40 significantly reduced these indicators of liver injury. A drastic decrease in liver steatosis was also observed in M40-treated WD-mice compared to vehicle-treated WD-mice. M40 treatment also ameliorated WD-induced increase in ductular reaction, fibrosis and liver inflammation in NAFLD mice. In vitro experiments confirmed that M40 decreased PA-induced steatosis of HepG2.The expression of Gal and its receptors GalR1 and GalR2, is enhanced in livers of mice on a WD. Treatment of WD-fed mice with M40 reduces steatosis, intrahepatic biliary mass, fibrosis and inflammation. Therefore, targeting GalR1 and GalR2 may be a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of NAFLD.<sep>BackgroundThe neurohormone melatonin, synthesized from serotonin by the enzyme Aralkylamine N-Acetyltransferase (AANAT) in the pineal gland and cholangiocytes, inhibits ductular reaction (DR), biliary senescence (that activates hepatic stellate cells by a paracrine pathway through release of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs such as TGFb1) and liver fibrosis by changes in the modulation of circadian rhythm.We have previously shown that in melatonin receptor MT1 -/-BDL mice there is reduced DR, biliary damage and liver fibrosis, whereas in melatonin receptor MT2 -/-BDL mice there is enhanced DR, biliary damage and liver fibrosis.Aims: To determine that (i) modulation of the AANAT/ melatonin/MT1/MT2 axis regulates biliary damage and liver fibrosis through changes in PER-1 expression (tumor suppressor gene which is downregulated in human cholangiocarcinoma); and (ii) knock-out of PER-1 increases DR, biliary senescence and liver fibrosis through changes in the AANAT/melatonin/MT1/MT2 axis.Methods: MT1 -/-, MT2 -/-and PER-1 -/-mice and corresponding wild-type mice underwent sham or BDL for 1 wk.We evaluated: (i) the expression of AANAT in liver sections by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by qPCR in total liver, (ii) melatonin serum levels by EIA; and (iii) the expression of the core clock components, CLOCK, BMAL-1, PER-1 and CRY-1, by immunofluorescence in liver sections (co-stained with CK-19) and by qPCR in total liver.To pinpoint the role of PER-1 in the regulation of melatonin-dependent changes in biliary damage/senescence and liver fibrosis, we measured changes in: (i) DR by IHC for CK-19 in liver sections; (iii) biliary senescence by SA-b-galactosidase staining, immunofluorescence for p16 co-stained with CK-19 in liver sections and qPCR for p16/p21 in total liver; and (ii) collagen content by Sirius red staining in liver sections and qPCR for selected fibrosis genes in total liver samples.Results: In BDL MT1 -/-mice there was reduced DR, biliary senescence and liver fibrosis but decreased biliary AANAT expression.Conversely, in BDL MT2 -/-mice there was: (i) enhanced DR, biliary senescence and liver fibrosis; and (ii) reduced AANAT biliary expression and melatonin serum levels concomitant with reduced PER-1 expression.Parallel to these findings, in PER-1 -/-BDL mice there was increased DR, biliary senescence and liver fibrosis concomitant with reduced biliary AANAT and MT2 expression and melatonin serum levels, and enhanced biliary expression of CLOCK, BMAL-1 and CRY-1.Conclusions: Our findings indicate that signaling via the MT1 axis with concomitant downregulation or lack of PER-1 stimulates biliary damage and liver fibrosis.Modulation of the hepatic AANAT/ melatonin/MT1/MT2 axis may be important in modulating biliary<sep>BackgroundThe neurohormone melatonin, synthesized from serotonin by the enzyme Aralkylamine N-Acetyltransferase (AANAT) in the pineal gland and cholangiocytes, inhibits ductular reaction (DR), biliary senescence (that activates hepatic stellate cells by a paracrine pathway through release of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs such as TGFb1) and liver fibrosis by changes in the modulation of circadian rhythm.We have previously shown that in melatonin receptor MT1 -/-BDL mice there is reduced DR, biliary damage and liver fibrosis, whereas in melatonin receptor MT2 -/-BDL mice there is enhanced DR, biliary damage and liver fibrosis.Aims: To determine that (i) modulation of the AANAT/ melatonin/MT1/MT2 axis regulates biliary damage and liver fibrosis through changes in PER-1 expression (tumor suppressor gene which is downregulated in human cholangiocarcinoma);

Ductular reaction characterized by extensive biliary cell proliferation, portal inflammation and fibrosis is observed in such conditions. Biliary senescence is increased during cholangiopathies, and leads to paracrine activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and increased liver fibrosis by changes in the Sct/MicroRNA (miR)‐125b‐dependent biliary release of TGF‐b1. Sct and SR are only expressed by cholangiocytes and the Sct/SR axis promotes biliary senescence through increased TGF‐b1 signaling. Damage to cholangiocytes and the role of Sct/SR signaling during ALD is unknown. Our aim is to characterize biliary cell damage, fibrosis, and the potential implications of biliary Sct/SR signaling during ALD. Methods Human samples from healthy and alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) patients were evaluated for: (i) Sct/SR/miR‐125b/TGF‐b1 axis and Sct serum levels, (ii) bile duct mass (IBDM), (iii) biliary senescence, (iv) Kupffer cell number, and (v) liver fibrosis as described below. In human samples, serum Sct levels were correlated with serum levels of total bilirubin (TBIL) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and MELD score. For in vivo studies, female wild‐type (WT), Sct −/− , SR −/− and Sct −/− /SR −/− (DKO) were ad libitum fed a 5% ethanol (EtOH) diet for 8 wks with a 31.5% EtOH gavage 1X/wk. Liver damage and steatosis were evaluated by H&amp;E and Oil Red O staining. Biliary Sct/SR expression was visualized by immunostaining, and serum Sct levels by EIA. IBDM was evaluated by CK‐19 (biliary‐specific marker) staining. Biliary senescence was determined by immunostaining for p16, p21 and SA‐b‐Galactosidase. Kupffer cell number was evaluated by staining for F4/80. Liver fibrosis was determined by Sirius Red staining, and immunostaining for Collagen‐1a. HSC activation was visualized by staining for desmin (HSC marker) and a‐smooth muscle actin (a‐SMA, increased in activated HSCs). Biliary miR‐125b levels were determined by q PCR, and TGF‐b1 expression by staining. Results Human ASH had increased biliary Sct/SR/miR‐125b/TGF‐b1 signaling, Sct secretion, IBDM, Kupffer cell number and liver fibrosis. Increased Sct serum levels positively correlated with serum TBIL and AST levels, and MELD score in ASH patients. WT EtOH mice had increased (i) liver damage/steatosis, (ii) biliary Sct/SR/miR‐125b/TGF‐b1 signaling and Sct secretion, (iii) IBDM and biliary senescence, (iv) Kupffer cell number, and (v) liver fibrosis/HSC activation compared to pair‐fed animals. These parameters were decreased in Sct −/− , SR −/− and DKO EtOH mice.

We previously found, however, that RYGB-associated ileal microbiota can paradoxically impair host glycemic control when transferred to germ-free mice. Here we present complementary evidence suggesting that this could be due to the heightened development of systemic endotoxemia. Consistently, application of ileal content from RYGB-treated compared with sham-operated rats onto Caco-2 cell monolayers compromised barrier function and decreased expression of the barrier-stabilizing proteins claudin-4 and desmoglein-2. Our findings raise the possibility that RYGB-associated ileal microbiota produce and release soluble metabolites which locally increase intestinal permeability to promote systemic endotoxemia-induced insulin resistance, with potential implications for the treatment of RYGB patients who eventually relapse onto type 2 diabetes.<sep>New technologies have greatly shaped the scientific and medical landscape within the last years. The unprecedented expansion of data and information on RNA biology has led to the discovery of new RNA classes with unique functions and unexpected modifications. Today, the biggest challenge is to transfer the large number of findings in basic RNA biology into corresponding clinical RNA-based therapeutics. Lately, this research begins to yield positive outcomes. RNA drugs advance to the final phases of clinical trials or even receive FDA approval. Furthermore, the introduction of the RNA-guided gene-editing technology CRISPR and advances in the delivery of messenger RNAs have triggered a major progression in the field of RNA-therapeutics. Especially short interfering RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides are promising examples for novel categories of therapeutics. However, several issues need to be addressed including intracellular delivery, toxicity, and immune responses before utilizing RNAs in a clinical setting. In this review, we provide an overview on opportunities and challenges for clinical translation of RNA-based therapeutics, with an emphasis on advances in novel delivery technologies and abdominal aortic aneurysm disease where non-coding RNAs have been shown to play a crucial regulatory role.<sep>Background Increasing arterial stiffness is a prominent feature of the aging cardiovascular system. Arterial stiffening leads to fundamental alterations in central hemodynamics with widespread detrimental implications for organ function resulting in significant morbidity and death, and specific therapies to address the underlying age‐related structural arterial remodeling remain elusive. The present study investigates the potential of the recently clinically available dual angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) to counteract age‐related arterial fibrotic remodeling and stiffening in 1‐year‐old mice. Methods and Results Treatment of in 1‐year‐old mice with ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan), in contrast to angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy (valsartan) and vehicle treatment (controls), significantly decreases structural aortic stiffness (as measured by in vivo pulse‐wave velocity and ex vivo aortic pressure myography). This phenomenon appears, at least partly, independent of (indirect) blood pressure effects and may be related to a direct antifibrotic interference with aortic smooth muscle cell collagen production. Furthermore, we find aortic remodeling and destiffening due to ARNI treatment to be associated with improved parameters of cardiac diastolic function in aged mice. Conclusions This study provides preclinical mechanistic evidence indicating that ARNI‐based interventions may counteract age‐related arterial stiffening and may therefore be further investigated as a promising strategy to improve cardiovascular outcomes in the elderly.<sep>Abstract OBJECTIVES Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) have an increased risk for developing thoracic aortic aneurysm, which is characterized by the destruction of the elastic media of the aortic wall. Several important enzymes have been characterized to play key roles in extracellular matrix homeostasis, namely matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, we investigated MMP-2 levels and their epigenetic regulation via the miR-29 family. METHODS Aortic tissue samples from 58 patients were collected during cardiac surgery, of which 30 presented with a BAV and 28 with a tricuspid aortic valve. Polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed to analyse MMP-2. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements were carried out to investigate both MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 levels. To examine the epigenetic regulation of aortic extracellular matrix homeostasis, we furthermore studied the expression levels of miR-29 via qRT-PCR. RESULTS Patients with a BAV were significantly younger at the time of surgery, presented significantly less frequently with arterial hypertension and displayed more often with an additional valvular disease. On a molecular level, we found that MMP-2 is increased on gene and protein level in BAV patients. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 levels do not differ between the groups. Interestingly, we also found that only miR-29A is significantly downregulated in BAVs. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the importance of MMP-2 in the context of extracellular matrix destruction in BAV patients. We present new evidence that miR-29A is a crucial epigenetic regulator of these pathomechanistic processes and might hold promise for future translational research.<sep>(1) Background: Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is caused by an endothelial entry tear followed by intimomedial delamination of the outer layers of the vessel wall. The established risk factors include hypertension and smoking. Another rising candidate risk factor is excessive alcohol consumption. This experimental study explores the effects of nicotine (Nic), angiotensin II (Ang II), and ethanol (EtOH) on human aortic endothelial cells (hAoEC). (2) Methods: HAoECs were exposed to Nic, Ang II, and EtOH at different dose levels. Cell migration was studied using the scratch assay and live-cell imaging. The metabolic viability and permeability capacity was investigated using the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay and an in vitro vascular permeability assay. Cell adherence was studied by utilizing the hanging drop assay. The transcriptional and protein level changes were analyzed by RT-qPCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry for major junctional complexing proteins. (3) Results: We observed reduced metabolic viability following Ang II and EtOH exposure vs. control. Further, cell adherence was enhanced by EtOH exposure prior to trituration and by all risk factors after trituration, which correlated with the increased gene and protein expression of VE-cadherin upon EtOH exposure. The cell migration capacity was reduced upon EtOH exposure vs. controls. (4) Conclusion: Marked functional changes were observed upon exposure to established and potential risk factors for AAD development in hAoECs. Our findings advocate for an enhanced mechanical rigidity in hAoECs in response to the three substances studied, which in turn might increase endothelial rigidity, suggesting a novel mechanism for developing an endothelial entry tear due to reduced deformability in response to increased shear and pulsatile stress.<sep>Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is the method of choice for most abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients requiring intervention. However, chronic aortic neck dilatation (AND) following EVAR progressively weakens the structural seal between vessel and endograft and compromises long-term results of the therapy. This experimental ex vivo study seeks to investigate mechanisms of AND.Porcine abdominal aortas (n=20) were harvested from slaughterhouse pigs and connected to a mock circulation. A commercially available endograft was implanted (n=10) or aortas were left untreated as controls (n=10). Vascular circumferential strain was assessed via ultrasound in defined aortic segments as a parameter of aortic stiffness. Histology and aortic gene expression analysis were performed to investigate potential changes of aortic wall structure and molecular differences due to endograft implantation.We found that endograft implantation acutely induces a significant stiffness gradient directly at the interface between stented and unstented aortic segments under pulsatile pressure. Comparing stented aortas with unstented controls, we detected increased aortic expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (Il6 and Ccl2) and matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp2 and Mmp9) after 6 hours of pulsatile pressurization. This effect, however, was abolished when repeating the same experiment under 6 hours of static pressure.We identified endograft-induced aortic stiffness gradients as an early trigger of inflammatory aortic remodeling processes that might promote AND. These results highlight the importance of adequate endograft designs to minimize vascular stiffness gradients and forestall late complications, such as AND.AND may compromise the long-term results following endovascular aortic repair. However, the mechanisms behind the underlying detrimental aortic remodeling are still unclear. In this study we find that endograft-induced aortic stiffness gradients induce an inflammatory aortic remodeling response consistent with AND. This novel pathomechanistic insight may guide the design of new aortic endografts that minimize vascular stiffness gradients and forestall late complications such as AND.<sep>Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are threatened by excessive cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. While accelerated arterial stiffening may represent a critical mechanistic factor driving cardiovascular risk in T2D, specific therapies to contain the underlying diabetic arterial remodeling have been elusive. The present translational study investigates the role of microRNA-29b (miR-29b) as a driver and therapeutic target of diabetic aortic remodeling and stiffening. Using a murine model (db/db mice), as well as human aortic tissue samples, we find that diabetic aortic remodeling and stiffening is associated with medial fibrosis, as well as fragmentation of aortic elastic layers. miR-29b is significantly downregulated in T2D and miR-29b repression is sufficient to induce both aortic medial fibrosis and elastin breakdown through upregulation of its direct target genes COL1A1 and MMP2 thereby increasing aortic stiffness. Moreover, antioxidant treatment restores aortic miR-29b levels and counteracts diabetic aortic remodeling. Concluding, we identify miR-29b as a comprehensive—and therefore powerful—regulator of aortic remodeling and stiffening in T2D that moreover qualifies as a (redox-sensitive) target for therapeutic intervention.

Cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction and heart failure represent the major cause of death in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Diabetes patients exhibit accelerated aortic stiffening which is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality. We recently showed that aortic stiffness precedes hypertension in a mouse model of diabetes (db/db mice), making aortic stiffness an early contributor to cardiovascular disease development. Elucidating how aortic stiffening develops is a pressing need in order to halt the pathophysiological process at an early time point. Methods To assess EndMT occurrence, we performed co-immunofluorescence staining of an endothelial marker (CD31) with mesenchymal markers (α-SMA/S100A4) in aortic sections from db/db mice. Moreover, we performed qRT-PCR to analyze mRNA expression of EndMT transcription factors in aortic sections of db/db mice and diabetic patients. To identify the underlying mechanism by which EndMT contributes to aortic stiffening, we used aortas from db/db mice and diabetic patients in combination with high glucose-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an in vitro model of diabetes-associated EndMT. Results We demonstrate robust CD31/α-SMA and CD31/S100A4 co-localization in aortic sections of db/db mice which was almost absent in control mice. Moreover, we demonstrate a significant upregulation of EndMT transcription factors in aortic sections of db/db mice and diabetic patients. As underlying regulator, we identified miR-132-3p as the most significantly downregulated miR in the micronome of db/db mice and high glucose-treated HUVECs. Indeed, miR-132-3p was also significantly downregulated in aortic tissue from diabetic patients. We identified Kruppel-like factor 7 (KLF7) as a target of miR-132-3p and show a significant upregulation of KLF7 in aortic sections of db/db mice and diabetic patients as well as in high glucose-treated HUVECs. We further demonstrate that miR-132-3p overexpression and KLF7 downregulation ameliorates EndMT in high glucose-treated HUVECs. Conclusions We demonstrate for the first time that EndMT contributes to aortic stiffening in T2D. We identified miR-132-3p and KLF7 as novel EndMT regulators in this context. Altogether, this gives us new insights in the development of aortic stiffening in T2D.</abstract>", "<keyword>Feature (linguistics)<sep>HPV infection<sep>State

For example, the performance of minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer can be effectively improved by using the time domain audio separation network (TasNet).

Three are Central and Eastern European countries that share a similar cultural and political heritage (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland). The other two are Flanders (Belgium) and Norway, representing Western Europe and the Nordics, respectively. We analysed 449,409 publications from 2013-2016 and found that, despite persisting differences between the two groups of countries across all disciplines, publication patterns in the Central and Eastern European countries are becoming more similar to those in their Western and Nordic counterparts. Articles from the Central and Eastern European countries are increasingly published in journals indexed in Web of Science and also in journals with the highest citation impacts. There are, however, clear differences between social science and humanities disciplines, which need to be considered in research evaluation and science policy.<sep>Abstract We investigate the state of multilingualism across the social sciences and humanities (SSH) using a comprehensive data set of research outputs from seven European countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Flanders [Belgium], Norway, Poland, and Slovenia). Although English tends to be the dominant language of science, SSH researchers often produce culturally and societally relevant work in their local languages. We collected and analyzed a set of 164,218 peer‐reviewed journal articles (produced by 51,063 researchers from 2013 to 2015) and found that multilingualism is prevalent despite geographical location and field. Among the researchers who published at least three journal articles during this time period, over one‐third from the various countries had written their work in at least two languages. The highest share of researchers who published in only one language were from Flanders (80.9%), whereas the lowest shares were from Slovenia (57.2%) and Poland (59.3%). Our findings show that multilingual publishing is an ongoing practice in many SSH research fields regardless of geographical location, political situation, and/or historical heritage. Here we argue that research is international, but multilingual publishing keeps locally relevant research alive with the added potential for creating impact.<sep>The purpose of this study is to expand the knowledge on publication patterns in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) in terms of the coverage of journal articles in Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) and their distribution in citation indexes. Within Journal Citation Reports (JCR), we focus deeper on quartile ranks based on the Journal Impact Factor. We analyse 441,088 publications over the years 2013-2016 from five European countries with focus on the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries and, especially on the Czech Republic. With this study, we aim to follow-up a discussion of publication patterns in SSH by providing complex data on recent developments primarily in CEE countries with similar cultural and political heritage (Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland) and comparing the patterns with Flanders (Belgium) and Norway representing Western and Nordic countries. Our findings show that despite a persisting distinction between the group of CEE countries and two Western/Nordic countries across all disciplines, CEE countries approach Western and Nordic counterparts in observed dimensions. Overall, the publication patterns in particular in CEE countries advance into a greater representation in journals indexed in WoS and within WoS into those of greater influence (Q1+Q2). Nonetheless, there are some substantial dissimilarities in the dynamics of this progress between countries and disciplines even within a specific subject area such as Social Sciences and Humanities. We conclude with the suggestion to take the differences between disciplines within SSH into account for research evaluation and science policy.</abstract>"]}
