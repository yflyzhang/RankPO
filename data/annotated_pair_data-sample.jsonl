Several variants within nucleocapsid and ORF3a epitopes have arisen independently in multiple lineages and result in loss of recognition by epitope-specific T cells assessed by IFN-γ and cytotoxic killing assays. Complete loss of T cell responsiveness was seen due to Q213K in the A∗01:01-restricted CD8+ ORF3a epitope FTSDYYQLY207-215; due to P13L, P13S, and P13T in the B∗27:05-restricted CD8+ nucleocapsid epitope QRNAPRITF9-17; and due to T362I and P365S in the A∗03:01/A∗11:01-restricted CD8+ nucleocapsid epitope KTFPPTEPK361-369. CD8+ T cell lines unable to recognize variant epitopes have diverse T cell receptor repertoires. These data demonstrate the potential for T cell evasion and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance for variants capable of escaping T cell as well as humoral immunity.<sep>Mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from international travel is a priority. We evaluated the effectiveness of travellers being required to quarantine for 14-days on return to England in Summer 2020. We identified 4,207 travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cases and their contacts, and identified 827 associated SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Overall, quarantine was associated with a lower rate of contacts, and the impact of quarantine was greatest in the 16-20 age-group. 186 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sufficiently unique to identify travel-related clusters. Fewer genomically-linked cases were observed for index cases who returned from countries with quarantine requirement compared to countries with no quarantine requirement. This difference was explained by fewer importation events per identified genome for these cases, as opposed to fewer onward contacts per case. Overall, our study demonstrates that a 14-day quarantine period reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the onward transmission of imported cases, mainly by dissuading travel to countries with a quarantine requirement.<sep>Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred at an unprecedented scale, and can be exploited for characterising outbreak risks at the fine-scale needed to inform control strategies. One setting at continued risk of COVID-19 outbreaks are higher education institutions, associated with student movements at the start of term, close living conditions within residential halls, and high social contact rates. Here we analysed SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences in combination with epidemiological data to investigate a large cluster of student cases associated with University of Glasgow accommodation in autumn 2020, Scotland. We identified 519 student cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with this large cluster through contact tracing data, with 30% sequencing coverage for further analysis. We estimated at least 11 independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the student population, with four comprising the majority of detected cases and consistent with separate outbreaks. These four outbreaks were curtailed within a week following implementation of control measures. The impact of student infections on the local community was short-term despite an underlying increase in community infections. Our study highlights the need for context-specific information in the formation of public health policy for higher educational settings.<sep>Abstract The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus leads to new variants that warrant timely epidemiological characterization. Here we use the dense genomic surveillance data generated by the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium to reconstruct the dynamics of 71 different lineages in each of 315 English local authorities between September 2020 and June 2021. This analysis reveals a series of subepidemics that peaked in early autumn 2020, followed by a jump in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7/Alpha lineage. The Alpha variant grew when other lineages declined during the second national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between November and December 2020. A third more stringent national lockdown suppressed the Alpha variant and eliminated nearly all other lineages in early 2021. Yet a series of variants (most of which contained the spike E484K mutation) defied these trends and persisted at moderately increasing proportions. However, by accounting for sustained introductions, we found that the transmissibility of these variants is unlikely to have exceeded the transmissibility of the Alpha variant. Finally, B.1.617.2/Delta was repeatedly introduced in England and grew rapidly in early summer 2021, constituting approximately 98% of sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes on 26 June 2021.<sep>The first epidemic wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Scotland resulted in high case numbers and mortality in care homes. In Lothian, over one-third of care homes reported an outbreak, while there was limited testing of hospital patients discharged to care homes.To investigate patients discharged from hospitals as a source of SARS-CoV-2 introduction into care homes during the first epidemic wave.A clinical review was performed for all patients discharges from hospitals to care homes from 1st March 2020 to 31st May 2020. Episodes were ruled out based on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test history, clinical assessment at discharge, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and an infectious period of 14 days. Clinical samples were processed for WGS, and consensus genomes generated were used for analysis using Cluster Investigation and Virus Epidemiological Tool software. Patient timelines were obtained using electronic hospital records.In total, 787 patients discharged from hospitals to care homes were identified. Of these, 776 (99%) were ruled out for subsequent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into care homes. However, for 10 episodes, the results were inconclusive as there was low genomic diversity in consensus genomes or no sequencing data were available. Only one discharge episode had a genomic, time and location link to positive cases during hospital admission, leading to 10 positive cases in their care home.The majority of patients discharged from hospitals were ruled out for introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into care homes, highlighting the importance of screening all new admissions when faced with a novel emerging virus and no available vaccine.<sep>Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncontrolled in many parts of the world; control is compounded in some areas by the higher transmission potential of the B.1.1.7 variant1, which has now been reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether the response of the virus to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the prototypic strain will be affected by the mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assess the immune responses of individuals after vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralizing antibody responses after the first and second immunizations using pseudoviruses that expressed the wild-type spike protein or a mutated spike protein that contained the eight amino acid changes found in the B.1.1.7 variant. The sera from individuals who received the vaccine exhibited a broad range of neutralizing titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against the B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some patients who had recovered from COVID-19. Decreased neutralization of the B.1.1.7 variant was also observed for monoclonal antibodies that target the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10) and the receptor-binding motif (5 out of 31), but not for monoclonal antibodies that recognize the receptor-binding domain that bind outside the receptor-binding motif. Introduction of the mutation that encodes the E484K substitution in the B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emerged variant of concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more-substantial loss of neutralizing activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies (19 out of 31) compared with the loss of neutralizing activity conferred by the mutations in B.1.1.7 alone. The emergence of the E484K substitution in a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine.<sep>The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for virus infection through the engagement of the human ACE2 protein1 and is a major antibody target. Here we show that chronic infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to viral evolution and reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies in an immunosuppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, by generating whole-genome ultra-deep sequences for 23 time points that span 101 days and using in vitro techniques to characterize the mutations revealed by sequencing. There was little change in the overall structure of the viral population after two courses of remdesivir during the first 57 days. However, after convalescent plasma therapy, we observed large, dynamic shifts in the viral population, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain that contained a substitution (D796H) in the S2 subunit and a deletion (ΔH69/ΔV70) in the S1 N-terminal domain of the spike protein. As passively transferred serum antibodies diminished, viruses with the escape genotype were reduced in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma treatment. In vitro, the spike double mutant bearing both ΔH69/ΔV70 and D796H conferred modestly decreased sensitivity to convalescent plasma, while maintaining infectivity levels that were similar to the wild-type virus.The spike substitution mutant D796H appeared to be the main contributor to the decreased susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, but this mutation resulted in an infectivity defect. The spike deletion mutant ΔH69/ΔV70 had a twofold higher level of infectivity than wild-type SARS-CoV-2, possibly compensating for the reduced infectivity of the D796H mutation. These data reveal strong selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy, which is associated with the emergence of viral variants that show evidence of reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies in immunosuppressed individuals.<sep>Abstract Background Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, evolutionary pressure has driven large increases in the transmissibility of the virus. However, with increasing levels of immunity through vaccination and natural infection the evolutionary pressure will switch towards immune escape. Genomic surveillance in regions of high immunity is crucial in detecting emerging variants that can more successfully navigate the immune landscape. Methods We present phylogenetic relationships and lineage dynamics within England (a country with high levels of immunity), as inferred from a random community sample of individuals who provided a self-administered throat and nose swab for rt-PCR testing as part of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. During round 14 (9 September–27 September 2021) and 15 (19 October–5 November 2021) lineages were determined for 1322 positive individuals, with 27.1% of those which reported their symptom status reporting no symptoms in the previous month. Results We identified 44 unique lineages, all of which were Delta or Delta sub-lineages, and found a reduction in their mutation rate over the study period. The proportion of the Delta sub-lineage AY.4.2 was increasing, with a reproduction number 15% (95% CI 8–23%) greater than the most prevalent lineage, AY.4. Further, AY.4.2 was less associated with the most predictive COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.029) and had a reduced mutation rate (p = 0.050). Both AY.4.2 and AY.4 were found to be geographically clustered in September but this was no longer the case by late October/early November, with only the lineage AY.6 exhibiting clustering towards the South of England. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 moves towards endemicity and new variants emerge, genomic data obtained from random community samples can augment routine surveillance data without the potential biases introduced due to higher sampling rates of symptomatic individuals.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Disease<sep>Klotho<sep>Epigenetics<sep>Dialysis<sep>Microbiome<sep>Head and neck cancer<sep>Inflammation<sep>Life course approach<sep>Exposome<sep>Kidney transplantation<sep>DNA methylation<sep>Transplantation<sep>Kidney disease<sep>Oral Microbiome<sep>Oral cavity<sep>Head and neck<sep>Ageing<sep>Oxidative stress<sep>dNaM</keyword><title>48.

Non-smoking, non-drinking (NSND) patients are increasing, with reports of worse survival. Growing evidence links dysplastic oral and circulatory microbiome with an increased risk for oral carcinogenesis in NSND patients. We are analysing the oral, circulatory and faecal microbiota in patients with oral dysplasia and SCCHN.<sep>The gap between improvements in lifespan and age-related health is widening. Globally, the demographic of ageing is increasing and there has emerged a ‘diseasome of ageing’, typified by a range of non-communicable diseases which share a common underlying component of a dysregulated ageing process. Within this, chronic kidney disease is an emerging global epidemic. The extensive inter-individual variation displayed in how people age and how their diseasome manifests and progresses, has required a renewed focus on their life course exposures and the interplay between the environment and the (epi)genome. Termed the exposome, life course abiotic and biotic factors have a significant impact on renal health. We explore how the exposome of renal ageing can predispose and affect CKD progression. We discuss how the kidney can be used as a model to understand the impact of the exposome in health and chronic kidney disease and how this might be manipulated to improve health span. Notably, we discuss the manipulation of the foodome to mitigate acceleration of ageing processes by phosphate and to explore use of emerging senotherapies. A range of senotherapies, for removing senescent cells, diminishing inflammatory burden and either directly targeting Nrf2, or manipulating it indirectly via modification of the microbiome are discussed.<sep>Significance: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be regarded as a burden of lifestyle disease that shares common underpinning features and risk factors with the aging process; it is a complex constituted by several adverse components, including chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, early vascular aging, and cellular senescence. Recent Advances: A systemic approach to tackle CKD, based on mitigating the associated inflammatory, cell stress, and damage processes, has the potential to attenuate the effects of CKD, but it also preempts the development and progression of associated morbidities. In effect, this will enhance health span and compress the period of morbidity. Pharmacological, nutritional, and potentially lifestyle-based interventions are promising therapeutic avenues to achieve such a goal. Critical Issues: In the present review, currents concepts of inflammation and oxidative damage as key patho-mechanisms in CKD are addressed. In particular, potential beneficial but also adverse effects of different systemic interventions in patients with CKD are discussed. Future Directions: Senotherapeutics, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (NRF2-KEAP1) signaling pathway, the endocrine klotho axis, inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), and live bio-therapeutics have the potential to reduce the burden of CKD and improve quality of life, as well as morbidity and mortality, in this fragile high-risk patient group.

It is currently unclear whether the two treatment options for end-stage kidney disease (dialysis and kidney transplantation [KT]) ameliorate the accelerated uremic ageing process.Data on clinical variables and blood DNA methylation (DNAm) from CKD stage G3-G5 patients were used to estimate biological age based on blood biomarkers (phenotypic age [PA], n = 333), skin autofluorescence (SAF age, n = 199) and DNAm (Horvath, Hannum and PhenoAge clocks, n = 47). In the DNAm cohort, we also measured the change in biological age 1 year after the KT or initiation of dialysis. Healthy subjects recruited from the general population were included as controls.All three DNAm clocks indicated an increased biological age in CKD G5. However, PA and SAF age tended to produce implausibly large estimates of biological age in CKD G5. By contrast, DNAm age was 4.9 years (p = 0.005) higher in the transplantation group and 5.9 years (p = 0.001) higher in the dialysis group compared to controls. This age acceleration was significantly reduced 1 year after KT, but not after 1 year of dialysis.Kidney failure patients displayed an increased biological age as estimated by DNAm clocks compared to population-based controls. Our results suggest that KT, but not dialysis, partially reduces the age acceleration.<sep>Abstract Background and Aims Chronic kidney disease (CKD) shares important features of a dysregulated ageing process with other common “burden of lifestyle” diseases, which aggregates into the diseasome of ageing. Typically, this is hallmarked by an acceleration of epigenetic (DNA methylation-based) clocks. It remains to be determined if current therapeutic interventions, such as renal transplantation or dialysis, can slow this clock, and thus the rate of biological ageing, in CKD. We therefore assessed the rate of biological ageing in CKD patients and whether these therapies impact on it, by measuring epigenetic age before and 1 year after treatment. Methods Whole blood samples were taken from CKD 5 patients at baseline and 1 year after renal transplantation (n=12) or dialysis (n=11; peritoneal dialysis n=7, haemodialysis n=4) as well as from age and sex-matched population-based controls (n=24). DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip and epigenetic age was calculated using three independent DNA methylation clocks: the Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge clocks. Additionally, a novel composite clock incorporating these three clocks was evaluated. We then calculated the age acceleration (difference between epigenetic and chronological age) for each clock and compared average age acceleration between groups and across time points. Results Incident dialysis patients displayed accelerated ageing versus chronologically age-matched controls (p&amp;lt;0.001). We observed a PhenoAge age acceleration difference in both the transplant (8.5 years, p=0.001) and dialysis (9.7 years, p&amp;lt;0.001) groups at baseline compared to control. After 1 year, we also observed a decrease of the age acceleration in the transplant group (mean reduced by 4.4 years, p=0.016), but not in the dialysis group (mean reduced by 0.7 years, p=0.668). Conclusion CKD 5 patients display an increased biological (i.e. epigenetic) age. This age acceleration is mitigated one year after renal transplantation, but not in patients undergoing dialysis. Neither therapy reverses high biological age.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/195505/postdoctoral-research-assistant-school-of-sport-and-exercise-sciences/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5003189451", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5002242341", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology, and public health, which is not directly aligned with the nutritional and exercise science focus required for the postdoctoral research assistant position.

Several optimal network reconfiguration approaches are available in literature. However, as shown by a very recent study on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system, these approaches fail to attain the least total real power losses. Despite that, the recent study did not consider multiple test systems and load variations. Consequently, this article addresses those unexplored areas by introducing an optimal network reconfiguration approach that minimizes the total real power losses in the standard IEEE 33- and 69-bus radial distribution systems under nominal (100%) and heavy (160%) load conditions. The developed approach, which is based on Sparrow Search Algorithm, intelligently searches for the optimum tie and sectionalizing branches that have to be switched on and off, respectively, in order to minimize the systems' total real power losses. The search for the optimum tie and sectionalizing branches is performed in the permutations of loops created by the radial distribution systems' tie and sectionalizing branches. For the considered two test systems, the developed approach gave the least total real power losses and the best bus voltage than the referenced approaches.&lt;/p&gt;<sep>The healthiness and or faultiness of oil-immersed electrical equipment using dissolved gas characterization has remained a critical and challenging task in power systems. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) continues to be the utmost preferred technique of detecting mainly slow evolving thermal and electrical faults. However, DGA can reveal more than just faults in equipment. This research looks at broad areas where DGA can be applied to determine the healthiness or faultiness of equipment in addition to fault identification. In equipment considered normal—i.e., fault-free—DGA can give the degree of healthiness (DOH) based on Rogers ratios C2H2/C2H4 &lt; 0.1, 0.1 &lt; CH4/H2 &lt; 1, and C2H4/C2H6 &lt; 1, plus the 3 &lt; CO2/CO &lt; 10 ratio for identifying fault-free devices. This answers the question: How healthy or normal is the equipment? Similarly, when these ratios are violated, it signifies the presence of faults, and two things ought to be determined. One is to identify the type of fault(s), which has been the norm. The other thing that can be evaluated is the degree of faultiness (DOF), based on the extent to which the ratios have been violated. Rarely has this been done. This might answer the question for the same fault class: How severe is the fault? To synthesize the DOH and/or DOF, fuzzy logic is applied. To diagnose faults, fuzzy logic and fuzzy-evidential tools are proposed. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy techniques are better than those of the IEC60599 and Rogers methods, and they are comparable to those of the Duval Triangle 1 and Pentagon 1 methods using the six IEC faults.

Bourret's box turtle (Cuora bourreti) is a critically endangered species of Indochinese box turtle in the family Geoemydidae. Four privately owned wild-caught Bourret's box turtles were presented for clinical evaluation for anorexia and lethargy following shipment from a reptile wholesaler 3 wk prior. Choanal-cloacal swabs of two of the turtles were positive for Mycoplasma sp. by polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of<sep>The spread of both infectious and noninfectious diseases through wildlife populations is of increasing concern. Neoplastic diseases are rarely associated with population-level impacts in wildlife; however, impacts on individual health can be severe and might reflect deteriorating environmental conditions. An adult male free-ranging Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) originally captured in 2005 and deemed healthy, was recaptured in 2018 with a 1 × 1.5 cm intra-oral broad-based right mandibular mass. An excisional<sep>Conservation efforts determining the health status of individuals can aid in assessing population health and sustainability. Body condition was determined in 65 free-ranging Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) from four locations in Vermilion County, Illinois, in the months of May, July, and September 2014, 2015, and 2016 using computed tomography (CT). Physical examinations were performed to determine morphometric measurements, and CT scans measured body fat. Twenty-three linear models were constructed<sep>Plasma biochemical enzymes are commonly assayed as part of a diagnostic evaluation for zoological species, but their interpretation is complicated by a lack of knowledge about tissue of origin in many reptiles. This study evaluated tissue specificity of six biochemical enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], creatine kinase [CK], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], and glutamate dehydrogenase [GLDH]) in 10 tissues (skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, lung, liver, gallbladder, pancreas,<sep>Abstract Chelonians are one of the most imperiled vertebrate taxa and many species are increasingly threatened by disease, however, the immune response in this group is understudied. We quantified the innate immune response of eastern ( Terrapene carolina ; EBT) and ornate ( Terrapene ornate; OBT) box turtles using plasma antibacterial activity assays. Plasma from both species abolished or significantly reduced the growth of all eight bacterial species evaluated, including Salmonella<sep>Few studies have characterized the prevalence of intraerythrocytic parasites in free-ranging chelonian populations or their occurrence across habitats. It is hypothesized that chelonians in different habitats have different exposures to vectors and thus differences in hemoparasite presence. This study explored the prevalence and intensity of intraerythrocytic parasites by examining blood smears from four species of Illinois turtles: wild Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii), eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina), ornate box turtle<sep>The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is the largest freshwater turtle species in North America and is classified as state endangered in Illinois. Head start programs that include health assessments and pathogen detection are being conducted to restore this species to its historic range. Physical examinations and oral and cloacal swabs were collected from 97 head start alligator snapping turtles prerelease and from 58 recaptured turtles postrelease in 2014. Conventional polymerase<sep>Ranaviruses are worldwide pathogens of ectothermic vertebrates that can threaten herptile conservation efforts. Identifying transmission routes is critical for understanding disease ecology and promoting species conservation. Frog virus 3 (FV3) DNA was detected in mosquitoes during a ranavirus outbreak in semicaptive box turtles, but the role that insect vectors play under natural conditions is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we collected mosquito species known to take blood meals from reptiles<sep>The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) is a coastal turtle with a range from Massachusetts to Texas and is the only exclusively brackish water turtle in North America. Two populations of wild terrapins from Maryland (n=55) and Georgia (n=7) were examined and tested for potential reptile pathogens.

We made weekly observations on seven<sep>Death due to illegal trade and trafficking serves as the largest threat to pangolins in their geographic range countries. Appropriate veterinary care is essential to the welfare of sick or debilitated pangolins. Given the challenge of comprehensive physical examination of this species due to its unique anatomic features and poorly studied physiology, laboratory diagnostics can provide essential information to guide appropriate medical care. This retrospective study included previously analyzed blood and<sep>Abstract Eastern ( Terrapene carolina carolina ) and ornate ( Terrapene ornata ornata ) box turtles have robust plasma antibacterial activity, however, the mechanism behind this activity is unknown. We used sheep red blood cell (SRBC) hemolysis assays, mannan‐affinity chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE), and matrix‐assisted laser desorption ionization time‐of‐flight (MALDI‐TOF) to explore the mechanisms of complement activity in box turtles. Plasma from both species demonstrated volume, time,<sep>Abstract Ophidiomycosis (snake fungal disease) is caused by the fungus Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola and threatens snake health worldwide. It has been documented throughout the eastern United States and severe cases have recently been reported in Georgia, USA. To evaluate disease distribution and prevalence in this state, 786 free-ranging snakes were examined for skin lesions consistent with ophidiomycosis and swabbed to detect O. ophiodiicola DNA using qPCR. Sampled snakes represented 34 species and<sep>Pathogen surveillance is common in chelonians and multiple anatomical sampling sites are used for pathogen detection, but agreement between these sites has not been assessed. The objective of this study was to assess agreement between three sampling sites, oral swab (OS), cloacal swab (CS), and combined oral/cloacal swab (OCS), for detecting three pathogens in eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina). Box turtles (n=88) were assayed for Terrapene adenovirus 1 (TerADV1), Terrapene<sep>Determination of the biological variation of laboratory tests is essential for accurate interpretation during health assessments. Few studies investigate the biological variation of CBC variables in reptiles, and none of these involve squamates. Thus, we investigated the biological variation of hematology parameters in bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) to determine if conventional population-based reference intervals are appropriate in evaluating single laboratory samples. Blood was collected from 10 bearded dragons five separate times<sep>Infections with herpesvirus have contributed to respiratory, enteric, and neurological disease reports in avian species worldwide. Herpesviruses have been detected in penguin species before but have not been studied extensively. To better understand the impact of these viruses in free-living populations, an initial retrospective survey was performed on a wild population of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) in the Punta San Juan Marine Protected Area, Peru (15°22′S, 75°12′W) using tracheal swabs collected<sep>The acute phase response is a highly conserved reaction to infection, inflammation, trauma, stress, and neoplasia. Acute phase assays are useful for wildlife health assessment, however, they are infrequently utilized in reptiles. This study evaluated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in eastern (Terrapene carolina carolina) and ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata ornata) and hemoglobin-binding protein (HBP) in T. ornata. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate in 90 T. carolina and 105 T. ornata was negatively<sep>Freshwater turtles are sensitive to environmental changes and can serve as sentinel species for ecosystem health assessments. The Efroymson Restoration at Kankakee Sands in northwestern Indiana, USA has been restored in the past 25 yr from primarily agricultural land to a mosaic of prairie and wetland habitats. Health assessments of 40 free-ranging painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) at Kankakee Sands were performed in May 2021 to evaluate overall health status, screen for<sep>A 2-yr-old female African side-neck turtle (Pelomedusa subrufa) housed at a pet store in Illinois, USA presented for evaluation of nasal discharge and an ulcerative skin lesion. Molecular diagnostics for Mycoplasma spp., herpesviruses, and frog virus 3 (ranavirus) were negative, and cytologic evaluation of the ulceration showed nonseptic inflammation without fungal elements. A presumptive diagnosis of a bacterial upper respiratory infection was treated with ceftazidime (20 mg/kg SC every 72 h)<sep>Herpesviruses are associated with disease in many chelonian species, resulting in pathology such as respiratory tract infection, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, hepatitis, and papillomatosis. Herpesvirus-associated fibropapillomas cause significant morbidity and mortality in marine turtles, and have been identified in an eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina) infected with Terrapene herpesvirus 2 (TerHV2). Further investigation is necessary to understand the impact of carcinogenic herpesviruses on chelonian health; however, reliable and specific methods for detection<sep>Turtles and tortoises are among the most threatened vertebrate groups. Their life history is characterized by delayed sexual maturity and a long lifespan, making populations susceptible to decline following perturbations. Despite the urgent conservation need, we are missing estimates of basic demographic traits for many species and populations. The ornate box turtle Terrapene ornata is a species lacking crucial demographic data. Many populations are isolated in fragmented habitats, especially in the<sep>A group of five juvenile Meller's chameleons (Trioceros melleri) experienced 100% mortality over a period of 1 mo due to ranavirus infection. The index case was found dead without premonitory signs. The three subsequent cases presented with nonspecific clinical signs (lethargy, decreased appetite, ocular discharge) and were ultimately euthanatized. The final case died after initially presenting with skin lesions. Postmortem examination revealed thin body condition in all five animals and mild<sep>Anticoagulants are employed to prevent clotting and preserve cellular morphology for clinical pathology tests. Lithium heparin (LH) is the most frequently used anticoagulant in chelonians; however, dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) may be superior in some species. Although eastern box turtles' (Terrapene carolina carolina) hematologic parameters are well studied, the effects of different anticoagulants on hematology in this species are unknown. This study evaluated the effects of LH and EDTA on hematologic<sep>: Nannizziopsis guarroi causes contagious dermatomycosis in lizards. Treatment failures are commonly encountered and may be related to the prolonged environmental persistence of this microbe. F10 SC, containing benzalkonium chloride and polyhexanide, is a commercially available disinfectant often used in management of reptile infections particularly by hobbyists and breeders. : Three molecularly confirmed isolates of N. guarroi were aseptically collected into aqueous suspensions and diluted to two fungal concentrations. Each concentration<sep>Abstract Hematology is a common tool for wildlife health assessments. Manual leukocyte counts are required in reptiles, however, disagreement between quantification methods has been observed in some chelonians. This study determined agreement between two methods of leukocyte quantification, eosinophilic leukopet, and blood film white blood cell (WBC) estimates, in free‐living eastern box turtles ( Terrapene carolina carolina ). Simultaneously, we assessed the impact of handling duration on both leukocyte quantity and<sep>Herpesviruses are significant pathogens of captive-reared and free-ranging chelonians worldwide. Lesions associated with chelonian herpesvirus infection are species dependent and include stomatitis in tortoises, hepatic necrosis in pond turtles, and fibropapillomas in sea turtles, among other conditions. Herpesviruses also have been detected in several free-ranging freshwater turtle species with no clinical signs of illness at a prevalence from 2 to 56%. The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a freshwater turtle<sep>Studies to assess wildlife health commonly evaluate clinical pathology changes, immune responses, pathogen presence, and contaminant exposure, but novel modalities are needed to characterize the unique physiologic responses of reptiles. Lactate is an indicator of hypoperfusion and/or anaerobic respiration and can be quickly and easily measured using a point-of-care analyzer. This study evaluated baseline blood lactate concentrations in free-living eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina, n = 116) using a point<sep>Characterizing host factors affecting individual health can be important in the conservation of many chelonians, including the Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii). However, many routine clinical pathology tests do not reliably detect differences in health status in reptiles. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has been shown to characterize inflammation in many species, including tortoises, and may be useful in assessing Blanding's turtles. The purpose of our study was to evaluate two methods<sep>Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) face a variety of anthropogenic, infectious, and environmental threats and have been affected by high morbidity and mortality disease events. Wellness parameters in free-ranging eastern box turtles with a high prevalence of myiasis on Cape Cod, MA, were documented to identify epidemiologic trends or associations with several health parameters. There were 109 samples collected from 59 individual box turtles over the course of 4 mon.<sep>Pathogens such as herpesviruses, Mycoplasma spp., and frog virus 3-like ranavirus have contributed to morbidity and mortality in many species of free-living and zoo-maintained chelonians. However, their prevalence is understudied in Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) across North America. To assess the presence of these pathogens, Blanding's turtles were sampled in Lake County, Illinois, in 2017 (N = 213) and 2018 (N = 160). DNA from cloacal-oral swabs was assayed for four<sep>Ophidiomycosis, commonly called snake fungal disease, has been linked to significant morbidity of free-ranging snakes in North America and Europe. Diagnosis of ophidiomycosis currently requires detection of skin lesions via physical exam or characteristic histopathology as well as detection of the causative agent, Ophidiomyces ophidiicola, through quantitative (q)PCR or fungal culture of a skin swab or tissue sample. While reliable, these methods require specialized training, invasive procedures (e.g., biopsy), and several<sep>Baseline plasma electrophoresis profiles (EPH) are important components of overall health and may aid in the conservation and captive management of species. The aim of this study was to establish plasma protein fractions for free-ranging Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) and evaluate differences due to age class (adult vs. sub-adult vs. juvenile), sex (male, female, or unknown), year (2018 vs. 2019), month (May vs. June vs. July), health status, and geographical location<sep>Mortality events in eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) threaten conservation efforts across the species range. These events are often under-diagnosed and, when observed, predictive health factors are unavailable prior to death. At Kickapoo State Park in central Illinois, USA, ranaviruses caused observed mortality events in amphibians and chelonians in 2014 and 2015. Following these outbreaks, eastern box turtles (n=36) were affixed with radio transmitters and temperature data loggers to obtain<sep>Leukogram evaluation provides valuable information about inflammation, infection, and stress in free-living and zoo-maintained wildlife. While multiple protocols for quantifying leukocytes are available in reptiles, agreement between methods is infrequently described and analytical variability (including repeatability and reproducibility) has not been critically evaluated. This study addresses these knowledge gaps for two hematological methods in eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina): Avian Leukopet™ (LO) and total white blood cell (WBC) estimates from<sep>Abstract Evaluating leukocytes provides insight in the overall health of animals by characterizing pathologies related to infection, inflammation, and stress. In reptile species, many leukocyte quantification methods are used to evaluate white blood cell parameters; however, agreement and analytical variability between the various methods have yet to be reported and critically assessed in many species, including the prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis). The objectives of this study were 1) to test agreement<sep>Frog virus 3 (FV3) and related ranaviruses are emerging infectious disease threats to ectothermic vertebrate species globally. Although the impact of these viruses on amphibian health is relatively well studied, less is understood about their effects on reptile health. We report two cases of FV3 infection, 11 mo apart, in three-toed box turtles (Terrapene mexicana triunguis) from a wildlife rehabilitation center. Case 1 had upper respiratory signs upon intake but had<sep>Herpesvirus infections have been associated with high morbidity and mortality in populations of captive emydid chelonians worldwide, but novel herpesviruses have also recently been identified in apparently healthy free-ranging emydid populations. Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii), an endangered species in Illinois, has experienced range-wide declines because of habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. A novel herpesvirus, Emydoidea herpesvirus 1 (EBHV1), was identified in Blanding's turtles in DuPage County, IL, in 2015. Combined oral-cloacal<sep>Chelonians are one of the most imperiled vertebrate taxa on the planet due to changes in the environment, anthropogenic influences, and disease. Over the last two decades, conservation strategies including nest protection, head-starting and meso-predator control have been successfully adopted by the Lake County Forest Preserve District for a population of state-endangered Blanding’s turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) in Illinois. Only recently have efforts expanded to assess the effects of management action on<sep>Large arachnids are commonly managed under professional care, and anesthesia is occasionally required for physical examination and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

The parasite Toxoplasma gondii blocks STAT1-mediated gene expression by secreting the intrinsically disordered protein TgIST that traffics to the host nucleus, binds phosphorylated STAT1 dimers, and occupies nascent transcription sites that unexpectedly remain silenced. Here we define a core region within internal repeats of TgIST that is necessary and sufficient to block STAT1-mediated gene expression. Cellular, biochemical, mutational, and structural data demonstrate that the repeat region of TgIST adopts a helical conformation upon binding to STAT1 dimers. The binding interface is defined by a groove formed from two loops in the STAT1 SH2 domains that reorient during dimerization. TgIST binding to this newly exposed site at the STAT1 dimer interface alters its conformation and prevents the recruitment of co-transcriptional activators, thus defining the mechanism of blocked transcription.<sep>Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs) proteins signal from cell-surface receptors to drive transcription of immune response genes.

Most commonly, antibiotic resistance is conferred by β-lactamase enzymes hydrolyzing β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin. Currently, to target β-lactamases with therapeutics, often only a single structure of the enzyme is considered. However, proteins are dynamic and populate high-energy excited states with non-negligible probabilities. Such states may contain open druggable pockets not seen in the crystal structure, termed cryptic pockets. At least three cryptic pockets in TEM β-lactamase have been identified previously by our lab, and at least one of these pockets, termed the Ω-loop pocket, was also found to exist in the CTX-M β-lactamase homologue. I hypothesize that cryptic pockets are conserved across the β-lactamase homologues and that these pockets are coupled to the active site because pocket dynamics are important for catalytic activity. To test this hypothesis, I use thiol labeling experiments to monitor pocket opening and measure the activity of labeled enzyme to assess coupling of the pocket to the active site. I also utilize mutations in cryptic pockets that increase bacterial fitness to examine their effects on pocket dynamics and catalytic efficiency. This work will help establish cryptic pockets as potential targets for therapeutics, and the conservation pattern will reveal whether cryptic pockets provide a means of achieving broad-spectrum activity, specificity, or both.<sep>Understanding the functional role of protein-excited states has important implications in protein design and drug discovery. However, because these states are difficult to find and study, it is still unclear if excited states simply result from thermal fluctuations and generally detract from function or if these states can actually enhance protein function. To investigate this question, we consider excited states in β-lactamases and particularly a subset of states containing a cryptic pocket which forms under the Ω-loop. Given the known importance of the Ω-loop and the presence of this pocket in at least two homologs, we hypothesized that these excited states enhance enzyme activity. Using thiol-labeling assays to probe Ω-loop pocket dynamics and kinetic assays to probe activity, we find that while this pocket is not completely conserved across β-lactamase homologs, those with the Ω-loop pocket have a higher activity against the substrate benzylpenicillin. We also find that this is true for TEM β-lactamase variants with greater open Ω-loop pocket populations. We further investigate the open population using a combination of NMR chemical exchange saturation transfer experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. To test our understanding of the Ω-loop pocket's functional role, we designed mutations to enhance/suppress pocket opening and observed that benzylpenicillin activity is proportional to the probability of pocket opening in our designed variants. The work described here suggests that excited states containing cryptic pockets can be advantageous for function and may be favored by natural selection, increasing the potential utility of such cryptic pockets as drug targets.<sep>Proteins are highly dynamic shape-shifters. However, it has proven easier to acknowledge the prevalence of protein dynamics than to account for the role it plays in protein function. Advanced methods for capturing protein dynamics are providing fundamental insights into the mechanism of allosteric communication. Cryptic pockets provide novel targets where therapeutics can bind and manipulate allosteric networks. Many proteins maintain a delicate equilibrium between multiple functional structures. Disrupting this sensitive balance provides new therapeutic opportunities. A protein is a dynamic shape-shifter whose function is determined by the set of structures it adopts. Unfortunately, atomically detailed structures are only available for a few conformations of any given protein, and these structures have limited explanatory and predictive power. Here, we provide a brief historical perspective on protein dynamics and introduce recent advances in computational and experimental methods that are providing unprecedented access to protein shape-shifting. Next, we focus on how these tools are revealing the mechanism of allosteric communication and features like cryptic pockets; both of which present new therapeutic opportunities. A major theme is the importance of considering the relative probabilities of different structures and the control one can exert over protein function by modulating this balance.

Pacemaker implantation is recommended to treat rhythm abnormalities in these neonates. We report the case of a late-preterm infant with Sjögren-syndrome-antibody-induced complete heart block who underwent temporary bipolar epicardial pacing as a bridge to permanent pacemaker implantation. Soon after the pacemaker was implanted, takotsubo cardiomyopathy developed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of reversible cardiomyopathy after pacemaker implantation in an infant.<sep>PURPOSE: Unintentional drowning is the second most leading cause of unintentional injury death among children and adolescents. Although there has been a decline in drowning related deaths in children, recent trends in drowning related hospitalizations have not been reported. Although CDC data and death certificates report the mortality data in drowning, they fail to capture all the associated factors that might have contributed to death. In this study, we explored a large inpatient population-based database and sought to study the associated risk factors that might serve as predictors of in hospital mortality in pediatric drowning. …<sep>Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in children has been shown to predict development of atherosclerotic disease in adulthood. 1 Bao W Srinivasan SR Wattigney WA Bao W Berenson GS Usefulness of childhood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in predicting adult dyslipidemia and other cardiovascular risks.

Medical records were reviewed for potential risk factors that affect BP. The % difference in mean arterial BP (% Diff-BP) measurements was calculated as (IBP-NIBP)/IBP. Hypotension was defined as mean arterial Bp < gestational age (GA).In total, 236 infants and 1,340 paired IBP-NIBP measurements were studied. Infants had a (mean ± standard deviation) GA of 25.4 ± 21.6 weeks and a birth weight of 810 ± 249 g. Overall, there was a significant correlation between IBP and NIBP of 0.887 (Spearman Rho; p < 0.001). However, the agreement between IBP and NIBP was poor, with a mean difference (95% limits of agreement) of 0.20 (-5.48; 5.89). The mean % Diff-BP (±standard deviation) was 0.39 ± 8.25%. In hypotensive infants, NIBP overestimated IBP measurements, with an agreement of -0.67 (-4.17; 2.83).Mean arterial NIBP correlates with IBP in ELGANs. However, there is a poor agreement between methods. In hypotensive infants, NIBP overestimates IBP measurements.<sep>Background: Despite proven efficacy and increased availability of therapeutic plasma exchange, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Study Design and Methods: This study utilized the Kids’ Inpatient Database and National Inpatient Sample (2003 to 2016) to study predictors of in-hospital mortality in hospitalized TTP patients. Adjusted odds ratios of death with various putative risk factors were calculated using multiple regression analysis. Results: Among 1568 hospitalizations with TTP as primary admission diagnosis who underwent therapeutic plasma exchange, 69 deaths were identified (all-cause mortality, 0.04%; median time-to-death, 6 wk). Overall, hospitalizations rates were fairly similar across the study period. The overall incidence of TTP related hospitalizations is 1.51 per 100,000 hospitalizations. A total of 69 deaths were reported with an all-cause in-hospital mortality rate of 0.04% (69/1568). The median time-to-death was 6 weeks. The majority of deaths occurred in age 16 to 20 years (58%), females (56.5%), and African American (42.9%) as shown in Table 2. Mean age for nonsurvivors was 14 years and the mean age of 15 years for survivors ( P =0.01). Younger age, male sex, African-American ethnicity, malignancy, sepsis, acute kidney injury, platelet transfusion was significantly associated with mortality in patients with TTP. Conclusions: Early and targeted therapy for high risk individuals should be used to guide management of TTP patients for improved survival outcomes.<sep>Background: Adult studies demonstrated that extremes of nutritional status adversely impact clinical outcomes in acute pancreatitis (AP). With rising prevalence of undernutrition/obesity in children, we analyzed the effect of nutritional status on the clinical outcomes in children and adolescents with acute pancreatitis. Methodology: We analyzed the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) between 2003 and 2016 to include all patients with a primary diagnosis of AP using specific International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. We classified into (1) undernutrition, (2) obesity and (3) control groups, based on ICD codes, and we compared severe acute pancreatitis and healthcare utilization (length of stay and hospitalization costs). Results: Total number of AP admissions was 39,805. The prevalence of severe AP was higher in the undernutrition and obesity groups than the control group (15.7% vs. 5.8% vs. 3.5% respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that undernutrition and obesity were associated with 2.5 and 1.6 times increased risk of severe AP, p &lt; 0.001. Undernutrition was associated with an additional six days of hospitalization and almost $16,000 in hospitalization costs. Obesity was associated with an additional 0.5 day and almost $2000 in hospitalization costs, p &lt; 0.001. Conclusion: Undernutrition and obesity were associated with greater severity of AP, as well as prolonged hospitalization stay and costs. It is imperative for treating clinicians to be aware of these high-risk groups to tailor management<sep>The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are increasing along with an increasing number of patients with comorbid conditions like psychiatric and behavioral disorders, which are independent predictors of quality of life.Non-overlapping years (2003-2016) of National Inpatient Sample and Kids Inpatient Database were analyzed to include all IBD-related hospitalizations of patients less than 21 years of age. Patients were analyzed for a concomitant diagnosis of psychiatric/behavioral disorders and were compared with IBD patients without psychiatric/behavioral disorder diagnoses for outcome variables: IBD severity, length of stay and inflation-adjusted hospitalization charges.Total of 161,294 IBD-related hospitalizations were analyzed and the overall prevalence rate of any psychiatric and behavioral disorders was 15.7%. Prevalence rate increased from 11.3% (2003) to 20.6% (2016), p<0.001. Depression, substance use, and anxiety were the predominant psychiatric disorders. Regression analysis showed patients with severe IBD (odds ratio [OR], 1.57; confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.67; p<0.001) and intermediate IBD (OR, 1.14; CI, 1.10-1.28, p<0.001) had increased risk of associated psychiatric and behavioral disorders than patients with a low severity IBD. Multivariate analysis showed that psychiatric and behavioral disorders had 1.17 (CI, 1.07-1.28; p<0.001) mean additional days of hospitalization and incurred additional $8473 (CI, 7,520-9,425; p<0.001) of mean hospitalization charges, independent of IBD severity.Prevalence of psychiatric and behavioral disorders in hospitalized pediatric IBD patients has been significantly increasing over the last two decades, and these disorders were<sep>To analyze the clinical characteristics, trends in hospitalization and health care resource utilization of pediatric patients with cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS).We analyzed the latest 5 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-Kids Inpatient Database (HCUP-KID) datasets including years 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2016 for patients aged 1-20 years with a primary diagnosis of CVS and were compared with Age/gender-matched controls for comorbidities, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization.A total of 12,396 CVS-related hospitalizations were analyzed. The mean age of CVS patients was 10.4 ± 6.7 years. CVS was associated with dysautonomia (OR: 12.1; CI: 7.0 to 20.8), dyspepsia (OR: 11.9; CI: 8.8 to 16.03), gastroesophageal reflux disease (OR: 6.9; Confidence Interval (CI): 6.4 to 7.5), migraine headaches (OR: 6.8; CI: 5.9 to 7.7) and irritable bowel syndrome (OR: 2.08; CI: 1.2 to 4.3) (all p < 0.001). CVS was also associated with increased cannabis use (OR: 5.26, 4.6 to 5.9; p < 0.001), anxiety disorder (OR: 3.9; CI: 3.5 to 4.4) and stress reaction (OR: 3.6; CI: 2.06 to 6.3), p < 0.001. Mean CVS-related hospitalization costs (inflation adjusted) more than doubled from $3199 in 2003 to $6721 in 2016, incurring $84 million/year in total costs.Hospitalized CVS patients have increased prevalence of DGBIs, dysautonomia, psychiatric conditions and cannabis use compared to non-CVS controls.

We sought to obtain the prevalence of MetS in ACHD from a large population-based database in the United States. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with ACHD in Explorys (IBM Inc., Armonk, New York) database from 2008 to 2019. The ACHD cohort included patients aged 20 to 39 years, with moderate and severe congenital heart disease, as defined by ACHD anatomic and physiologic classification. Patients were diagnosed with MetS using the modified International Diabetes Federation's diagnostic criteria. Logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the risk of MetS in the ACHD cohort. MetS was diagnosed in 1,860 of 6,720 patients with ACHD (27.6%). Among 7,359,470 controls, MetS was seen in 742,010 (10.1%). The average age of MetS in ACHD was 31.5 and 32.7 years in controls (p &lt;0.001). The risk of MetS was higher in ACHD versus controls (odds ratio [OR] 2.75 [2.61 to 2.89], p &lt;0.001).

In conclusion, MetS<sep>Studies in adults have shown an increasing incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in patients hospitalized with acute pancreatitis (AP). There is lack of epidemiological data on CDI and its impact on hospitalized pediatric patients with AP.We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample and Kids' Inpatient Database between the years 2003 and 2016 and included all patients (age <21 years) with a primary diagnosis of AP using specific International Classification of Diseases codes. We compared clinical outcomes between children with CDI and those without CDI. Our primary outcome was severe AP and secondary outcomes included length of stay and hospital charges.A total of 123,240 hospitalizations related to AP were analyzed and CDI was noted in 0.6% of the hospital. The prevalence rate of CDI doubled from 0.4% (2003) to 0.8% (2016), p=0.03. AP patients with CDI had increased comorbidities, and also underwent more invasive surgical procedures, p<0.05. AP patients with CDI had a higher in-hospital mortality rate and increased prevalence of severe AP, p<0.001. Multivariate regression models showed that CDI was associated with 2.4 times (confidence interval [CI]: 1.91 to 3.01, p<0.001) increased odds of severe AP. CDI patients had 7.24 (CI: 6.81 to 7.67, p<0.001) additional hospital days while incurring $59,032 (CI: 54,050 to 64,014, p<0.001) additional hospitalization charges.CDI in pediatric patients with AP is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased healthcare resource utilization. Further<sep>Patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) often have a debilitating clinical course characterized by high disease burden, and poor quality of life and these factors adversely affect mental health. However, there is paucity of literature on the prevalence and impact of psychiatric disorders on hospitalized pediatric patients with CP.ology: We analyzed the Kids Inpatient Database, and National Inpatient Sample, between 2003 and 2019 and included patients up to 21 years of age. Pediatric CP patients with psychiatric disorders were compared with patients without any of the psychiatric disorders using the ICD diagnostic codes. Various demographic and clinical factors were compared between the groups. Length of hospitalization and total hospital charges were used as surrogates to compare the hospital resource utilization between the groups.We analyzed a total of 9,808 hospitalizations with CP and the overall prevalence rate of psychiatric disorders was 19.8%. The prevalence rate increased from 19.1% in 2003 to 23.4% in 2019, p = 0.006. The peak prevalence rate of 37.2% was noted at 20 years of age. Depression was noted at 7.6% of the total hospitalizations followed by substance abuse (6.5%), and anxiety (4.4%). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that among CP patients, psychiatric disorders were independently associated with 1.3 additional days of stay and incurred $15,965 higher charges.The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is increasing in pediatric CP. The concomitant presence of psychiatric disorders was<sep>Abstract Aims Cannabis is an increasingly common recreational substance used by teenagers. However, there is limited data probing association of cardiac arrhythmias with marijuana use in this population. Methods and Results We provide prevalence trends, disease burden and healthcare utilization of cardiac arrhythmias associated with cannabis use disorder (CUD) in hospitalized teenagers (13–20 years) using a large national administrative database in the United States from 2003–2016. We used partial least square regression analysis for assessing trends in prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias and multiple logistic regression to elucidate independent predictors of arrhythmias associated with CUD. Among all CUD related hospitalizations (n = 876, 431), 0.5% had arrhythmias. Prevalence trends of arrhythmias among CUD increased six-fold during the study period (P &amp;lt; 0.001). CUD was more prevalent in males and older teens (both P &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a significant risk for mortality when CUD was associated with arrhythmia (7.4% vs. 0.1%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). While mean length-of-stay (LOS) was shorter (4.4 vs. 5.4 days, P &amp;lt; 0.001) for patients with CUD, they incurred three times higher mean hospitalization charges when compared to CUD patients without arrhythmia ($45 959 vs. $18 986, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Both LOS and hospitalization charges showed an uptrend during the study period (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and obesity independently predicted arrhythmias in CUD while other substance abuse<sep>Summary Introduction Severe sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality among children. Studies in adults have suggested a protective effect of obesity on mortality among patients hospitalized with sepsis. Paediatric studies evaluating similar relationship is lacking. Methods We analysed non‐overlapping years of the Kids Inpatient Database (KID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2003 and 2014 of all paediatric patients with severe sepsis (PSS) up to 20 years of age. PSS was defined using specific International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and modified Angus criteria. Using ICD‐9 diagnosis codes, patients were divided into three mutually exclusive groups (obesity, morbid obesity and control groups), and these groups were compared for outcomes measures including in‐hospital mortality and healthcare resource utilization using the length of stay and inflation‐adjusted hospitalization charges. Results We analysed 109 026 hospitalizations due to PSS. The prevalence rate of obesity was 1.5% ( n = 1643), and morbid obesity was 1.05% ( n = 1147).

Methodology: Retrospective analysis of National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and Kids Inpatient database (KID) database from 2003 to 2014 and included patients between 1 and 20 years of age. Using ICD‐9 codes, we identified all hospitalizations with PLA and compared them with 1 : 10 age‐ and gender‐matched controls. Amebic liver abscess and Candida infections were excluded. Results: Total number of PLA admissions is 4075. The overall incidence of PLA is 13.5 per 100,000 hospitalizations, which increased by 60% between 2003 and 2014. The mean age of patients was 13.03 ± 6.1 years and were predominantly boys—61%. Of the comorbid conditions, hepatobiliary malignancy had the highest odds ratio (OR 71.8) followed by liver transplant (OR 38.4), biliary disease (OR 29.9), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (OR 5.35), other GI malignancies (OR 4.74), primary immune deficiency disorder (OR 4.13). Patients with PLA had 12 times increased odds of having associated severe sepsis. Infective endocarditis (IE) (OR 4.5), appendicitis (OR 1.8), and diverticulitis (OR 8.1) were significantly associated with PLA. Almost 39% (1575) of the PLA patients had positive culture, whereas Streptococcus (10.8%) and Staphylococcus spp (9.2%) were the most common pathogens. About 45% of PLA patients underwent percutaneous liver abscess aspiration whereas 4.1% had hepatic resection for PLA. The mortality<sep>Background: Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) in premature neonates has been associated with comorbidities including chronic lung disease (CLD), and death. However, the treatment of PDA remains controversial. There have been several echocardiographic variables previously used to determine the hemodynamic significance of PDA but their utility in early prediction of clinical outcomes is not well studied. Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate the use of a severity scoring system incorporating markers of systemic under perfusion, pulmonary over perfusion and left ventricular (LV) function in predicting clinical outcomes in premature neonates. Methods: It is a single center prospective observational study involving newborns &lt; 32 weeks’ gestation. An echocardiogram was done within seven days of life to measure variables previously known to predict severity of shunting in PDA including pulmonary perfusion index (PPI). Predictors of CLD/death were identified using multivariate logistic regression. A severity score was derived and its ability to predict clinical outcomes was tested using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: We studied 98 infants with a mean (SD) gestation of 28.9 ± 1.91 weeks and birth weight of 1228.06 ± 318.94 g, respectively. We identified five echocardiographic variables along with gestational age that was independently associated with the outcome variable (PPI, LV output, Superior Mesenteric Artery [SMA] Velocity Time Integral [VTI], Peak diastolic flow velocity in Pulmonary Vein [PV Vd], and reversal of<sep>The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence, morbidity, and mortality to inform local and international efforts toward reducing cancer burden.To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019.The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% UI, 14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019.

This paper reviews the magnitude of total CVD burden, including 13 underlying causes of cardiovascular death and 9 related risk factors, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to 285 million) in 1990 to 523 million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1 million (95% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95%</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Fibrosis<sep>Myeloid cells<sep>Choline<sep>Ex vivo<sep>Mutation<sep>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease<sep>Steatohepatitis<sep>PLD2<sep>In vivo<sep>Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Kinase<sep>Immunophenotyping<sep>Saccharomyces cerevisiae<sep>Amastigote<sep>Phosphocholine<sep>Phosphatidylcholine<sep>Inflammation<sep>Janus kinase 3<sep>Interleukin 21<sep>Pyrin domain<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Induced pluripotent stem cell<sep>LYN<sep>Immune system<sep>TLR4<sep>Mutant<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Antiparasitic<sep>Leishmania<sep>AMPK<sep>Inflammasome<sep>B cell<sep>Cytotoxic T cell<sep>Hepatic stellate cell<sep>Tubulin<sep>Downregulation and upregulation<sep>Choline kinase<sep>Syk<sep>Axenic<sep>Gene</keyword><title>Mutations in topoisomerase IIβ result in a B cell immunodeficiency<sep>NLRP3 inflammasome dependent cell death in myeloid cells drives liver inflammation and fibrosis in murine steatohepatitis<sep>Choline Uptake and Metabolism Modulate Macrophage IL-1β and IL-18 Production<sep>Choline uptake and metabolism modulate macrophage immunity<sep>Src- and Abl-family kinases activate spleen tyrosine kinase to maximize phagocytosis and <i>Leishmania</i> infection<sep>The Human Milk Oligosaccharide 3’Sialyllactose Promotes Inflammation Resolution and Reduces Atherosclerosis Development in Mice<sep>Disease-associated mutations in topoisomerase IIβ result in defective NK cells<sep>The Src and Abl family kinases activate the Spleen Tyrosine Kinase to maximize phagocytosis and<i>Leishmania</i>infection<sep>Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapy Decreases IL-1β Expression and Prolongs Survival in Mutant <i>Nlrp3</i> Mice<sep>NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Myeloid Cells Is Crucial for Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis in Murine Steatohepatitis<sep>An Antiparasitic Compound from the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pathogen Box Promotes <i>Leishmania</i> Tubulin Polymerization<sep>Cell-specific Deletion of NLRP3 Inflammasome Identifies Myeloid Cells as Key Drivers of Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis in Murine Steatohepatitis</title><abstract>Abstract B cell development is a highly regulated process involving multiple differentiation steps, yet many details regarding this pathway remain unknown. Sequencing of patients with B cell-restricted immunodeficiency reveals autosomal dominant mutations in TOP2B . TOP2B encodes a type II topoisomerase, an essential gene required to alleviate topological stress during DNA replication and gene transcription, with no previously known role in B cell development. We use Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and knockin and knockout murine models, to demonstrate that patient mutations in TOP2B have a dominant negative effect on enzyme function, resulting in defective proliferation, survival of B-2 cells, causing a block in B cell development, and impair humoral function in response to immunization.<sep>treatment induced the recovery from hepatosteatosis reducing liver de novo lipogenesis without changing fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride secretion.Serum transaminases and liver fibrotic and inflammatory markers remained unaltered in these mice, while serum FGF21 increased.In vitro experiments with hepatocytes from HFD-fed ASO-treated mice and in vivo experiments with liver specific Fgf21-KO mice showed that liver FGF21 was driving the recovery from obesity.Targeting Mat1a in HFD-fed BAT β-Klothoand Ucp1-KD mice showed the involvement of thermogenesis in the phenotype.Hepatocyte FGF21 secretion was induced by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a mediator of antioxidant response, as the binding to the Fgf21 promoter in Mat1a ASOtreated HFD-fed mice hepatocytes and treatments with Nrf2 siRNA, ML385 -a NRF2 inhibitor-, SAMe and the antioxidants glutathione and N-acetylcysteine showed.<sep>Choline is a vitamin-like nutrient that is taken up via specific transporters and metabolized by choline kinase, which converts it to phosphocholine needed for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the main phospholipid of cellular membranes. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation enhances choline uptake by macrophages and microglia through induction of the choline transporter CTL1. Inhibition of CTL1 expression or choline phosphorylation attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β and IL-18 production in stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, reduced choline uptake altered mitochondrial lipid profile, attenuated mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and activated the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). By potentiating mitochondrial recruitment of DRP1, AMPK stimulates mitophagy, which contributes to termination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Correspondingly, choline kinase inhibitors ameliorated acute and chronic models of IL-1β-dependent inflammation.<sep>Abstract Choline is a vitamin-like nutrient that is taken up via specific transporters and metabolized by choline kinase (ChoKα) which converts it to phosphocholine needed for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the main phospholipid of cellular membranes. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation enhances choline uptake by macrophages through induction of the choline transporter CTL1. Choline is rapidly phosphorylated and mobilized to the Kennedy pathway leading to increased cellular phosphatidylcholine production. Inhibition of choline uptake or phosphorylation attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β and IL-18 production in stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, reduced choline uptake altered mitochondrial lipid profile, attenuated mitochondrial ATP synthesis and activated the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). By potentiating mitochondrial recruitment of DRP1, AMPK stimulates mitophagy, which contributes to termination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Correspondingly, pharmacological ChoKα inhibition ameliorated acute and chronic macrophage-dependent inflammation in vivo.<sep>Leishmania spp. are obligate intracellular parasites that must be internalized by phagocytic cells to evade immune responses and cause disease. The uptake of both Leishmania promastigotes (insect-stage parasites) and amastigotes (proliferative-stage parasites in humans and mice) by phagocytes is thought to be mainly host cell driven, not parasite driven. Our previous work indicates that host Src- and Abl-family kinases facilitate Leishmania entry into macrophages and pathogenesis in murine cutaneous leishmaniasis. Here, we demonstrate that host spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is required for efficient uptake of Leishmania promastigotes and amastigotes. A Src-family kinase-Abl-family kinase-SYK signaling cascade induces Leishmania amastigote internalization. Finally, lesion size and parasite burden during Leishmania infection is significantly decreased in mice lacking SYK in monocytes or by treatment with the SYK inhibitor entospletinib. In summary, SYK is required for maximal Leishmania uptake by macrophages and disease in mice. Our results suggest potential for treating leishmaniasis using host cell-directed agents.<sep>SUMMARY Macrophages contribute to the induction and resolution of inflammation and play a central role in the chronic low-grade inflammation in cardiovascular diseases caused by atherosclerosis. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are complex unconjugated glycans unique to human milk that benefit infant health and act as innate immune modulators. Here, we identify the HMO 3’sialyllactose (3’SL) as a natural inhibitor of TLR4-induced low-grade inflammation in macrophages and endothelium. Transcriptome analysis in macrophages revealed that 3’SL attenuates a selected set of inflammatory gene expression and promotes activity of LXR and SREBP. These acute anti-inflammatory effects of 3’SL were associated with reduced histone H3K27 acetylation at a subset of LPS-inducible enhancers distinguished by preferential enrichment for CTCF, IRF2, BCL6, and other transcription factor recognition motifs. In a murine atherosclerosis model, both subcutaneous and oral administration of 3’SL significantly reduced atherosclerosis development and the associated inflammation. This study provides evidence that 3’SL attenuates inflammation by a transcriptional mechanism to reduce atherosclerosis development in the context of cardiovascular disease.<sep>Hoffman syndrome is a syndromic, inborn error of immunity due to autosomal-dominant mutations in TOP2B, an essential gene required to alleviate topological stress during DNA replication and gene transcription. Although mutations identified in patients lead to a block in B-cell development and the absence of circulating B cells, an effect on natural killer (NK) cells was not previously examined.We sought to determine whether disease-associated mutations in TOP2B impact NK-cell development and function.Using a knockin murine model and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we investigated NK-cell development in mouse bone marrow and spleen, and performed immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, gene expression, and functional assessment of cytotoxic activity in murine NK cells, and human IPSC-derived NK cells.Mature NK cells were reduced in the periphery of TOP2B knockin mice consistent with patient reports, with reduced cytotoxicity toward target cell lines. IPSCs were successfully derived from patients with Hoffman syndrome, but under optimal conditions showed reduced cytotoxicity compared with iPSC-derived NK cells from healthy controls.Hoffman syndrome-associated mutations in TOP2B impact NK-cell development and function in murine and human models.<sep>ABSTRACT Leishmania spp. are obligate intracellular parasites that must be internalized by phagocytic cells to evade immune responses and cause disease.

SUMMARY STATEMENT Activation of Spleen Tyrosine Kinase by Src and Abl family kinases is required for maximal Leishmania uptake by macrophages and disease in a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis.<sep>Abstract Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are a novel therapeutic strategy that targets a specific gene and suppresses its expression. The cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are a spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases characterized by systemic and tissue inflammation that is caused by heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) gene. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an Nlrp3-specific ASO treatment in CAPS. An Nlrp3-specific ASO was designed and tested in murine cell lines and bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) from wild-type and CAPS mouse models. Nlrp3 knock-in mice were treated in vivo with Nlrp3-specific ASO, survival was monitored, and expression of organ-specific Nlrp3 and IL-1β was measured. Nlrp3-specific ASO treatment of murine cell lines and BMDMs showed a significant downregulation of Nlrp3 and mature IL-1β protein expression. Ex vivo treatment of Nlrp3 mutant mouse-derived BMDMs with Nlrp3-specific ASO demonstrated significantly reduced IL-1β release. In vivo, Nlrp3-specific ASO treatment of Nlrp3 mutant mice prolonged survival, reduced systemic inflammation, and decreased tissue-specific expression of Nlrp3 and mature IL-1β protein. The results of this study demonstrate that Nlrp3-specific ASO treatment downregulates Nlrp3 expression and IL-1β release in CAPS models, suggesting ASO therapy as a potential treatment of CAPS and other NLRP3-mediated diseases.<sep>Introduction: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is showing a rapidly rising prevalence and meanwhile the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Inflammation, cellular death, and liver fibrosis are characteristics of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex promoting activation of caspase-1 as well as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) release, is recognized as a key driver of these characteristics. However, the cell-specific contribution of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in NAFLD remains unknown. Method: A conditional Nlrp3 knock-out mouse was generated and bred to mice expressing Cre under the control of Lysozym to investigate the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in myeloid cells. Both acute (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/adenosine-triphosphate (ATP)) and chronic (choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet (CDAA-HFAT)) liver injury models were used to induce in vivo NLRP3 activation and fibrotic-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Liver inflammation and fibrosis were analysed. Results: Myeloid-specific Nlrp3 knock-out resulted in a systemic and hepatic increase of IL-1β release induced by LPS/ATP injection. NASH-associated hepatic inflammation in the CDAA-HFAT model was ameliorated in myeloid-specific Nlrp3 knock-out mice. Furthermore, myeloid-specific Nlrp3 knock-out mice showed reduced liver fibrosis and decreased hepatic stellate cell activation. Conclusion: This study provides new insights in the cell-specific role of NLRP3 in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. NLRP3 inflammasome activation in myeloid cells was identified as crucial for the progression of NAFLD to fibrotic-NASH. These results may have implications for the development of cell-specific strategies for modulation of NLRP3 activation for treatment of NAFLD.<sep>The few frontline antileishmanial drugs are poorly effective and toxic. To search for new drugs for this neglected tropical disease, we tested the activity of compounds in the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) “Pathogen Box” against Leishmania amazonensis axenic amastigotes. Screening yielded six discovery antileishmanial compounds with EC50 values from 50 to 480 nM. Concentration–response assays demonstrated that the best hit, MMV676477, had mid-nanomolar cytocidal potency against intracellular Leishmania amastigotes, Trypanosoma brucei, and Plasmodium falciparum, suggesting broad antiparasitic activity. We explored structure–activity relationships (SAR) within a small group of MMV676477 analogs and observed a wide potency range (20–5000 nM) against axenic Leishmania amastigotes. Compared to MMV676477, our most potent analog, SW41, had ∼5-fold improved antileishmanial potency. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that MMV676477 selectively disrupts Leishmania tubulin dynamics. Morphological studies indicated that MMV676477 and analogs affected L. amazonensis during cell division. Differential centrifugation showed that MMV676477 promoted partitioning of cellular tubulin toward the polymeric form in parasites. Turbidity assays with purified Leishmania and porcine tubulin demonstrated that MMV676477 promoted leishmanial tubulin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner. Analogs’ antiparasitic activity correlated with their ability to facilitate purified Leishmania tubulin polymerization. Chemical cross-linking demonstrated binding of the MMV676477 scaffold to purified Leishmania tubulin, and competition studies established a correlation between binding and antileishmanial activity. Our studies demonstrate that MMV676477 is a potent antiparasitic compound that preferentially promotes Leishmania microtubule polymerization. Due to its selectivity for and broad-spectrum activity against multiple parasites, this scaffold shows promise for antiparasitic drug development.<sep>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. The NLRP3 inflammasome, a platform for caspase-1 activation and release of interleukin 1β, is increasingly recognized in the induction of inflammation and liver fibrosis during NAFLD. However, the cell-specific contribution of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in NAFLD remains unknown.To investigate the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and myeloid cells, a conditional Nlrp3 knock-out mouse was generated and bred to cell-specific Cre mice. Both acute and chronic liver injury models were used: lipopolysaccharide/adenosine-triphosphate to induce in vivo NLRP3 activation, choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet, and Western-type diet to induce fibrotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In vitro co-culture studies were performed to dissect the crosstalk between myeloid cells and HSCs.Myeloid-specific deletion of Nlrp3 blunted the systemic and hepatic increase in interleukin 1β induced by lipopolysaccharide/adenosine-triphosphate injection. In the choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet model of fibrotic NASH, myeloid-specific Nlrp3 knock-out but not hepatocyte- or HSC-specific knock-out mice showed significant reduction in inflammation independent of steatosis development. Moreover, myeloid-specific Nlrp3 knock-out mice showed ameliorated liver fibrosis and decreased HSC activation. These results were validated in the Western-type diet model. In vitro co-cultured studies with human cell lines demonstrated that HSC can be activated by inflammasome stimulation in monocytes, and this effect was significantly reduced if NLRP3 was downregulated in monocytes.The study provides new insights in the cell-specific role of NLRP3 in liver inflammation and fibrosis. NLRP3 inflammasome activation in myeloid cells was identified as crucial for the progression of NAFLD to fibrotic NASH. These results may have implications for the development of cell-specific strategies for modulation of NLRP3 activation for treatment of fibrotic NASH.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/653711", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5081762127", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5040945709", "response": "Comparison: Candidate B's research focuses on molecular and cellular mechanisms, particularly in inflammation, fibrosis, and immune responses, which aligns closely with the job's emphasis on cryoelectron tomography and biomolecular condensates.

Historically, formalin has been the fixative of choice in both research and clinical settings due to cost, accessibility, and broad applicability. Here, we describe a method for collection of porcine colon, and compare the usage of Carnoy’s solution (CS) to a 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) in tissue fixation. Consecutive colon samples were collected from 24 four-wk-old piglets and fixed in CS for 45 min or NBF for 24 h. We measured the thickness of the inner mucus layer using Alcian Blue stain and found thicker inner mucus layers in porcine colons fixed with CS as compared to NBF (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). Carnoy’s solution-fixed colon exhibited greater bacterial cell counts than NBF-fixed colon (P &amp;lt; 0.0022) after labeling with an eubacterial probe in fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). No difference was observed between the mucosal height (P = 0.42) and number of goblet cells (P = 0.66) between the 2 fixatives. From this, we concluded CS is more suitable than NBF for the preservation of the mucus layer and the associated mucosal bacteria in the porcine colon without compromising on overall tissue morphology. This study provides a useful sampling and fixation methodology for histology studies in the porcine gastrointestinal tract, and may be beneficial to microbiota, pathology, and nutrition studies.<sep>Abstract Post-weaning enteropathies in swine caused by pathogenic E. coli , such as post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) or edema disease (ED), remain a significant problem for the swine industry. Reduction in the use of antibiotics over concerns of antibiotic resistance and public health concerns, necessitate the evaluation of effective antibiotic alternatives to prevent significant loss of livestock and/or reductions in swine growth performance. For this purpose, an appropriate piglet model of pathogenic E. coli enteropathy is required. In this study, we attempted to induce clinical signs of post-weaning disease in a piglet model using a one-time acute or lower daily chronic dose of a pathogenic E. coli strain containing genes for both heat stable and labile toxins, as well as Shiga toxin. The induced disease state was monitored by determining fecal shedding and colonization of the challenge strain, animal growth performance, cytokine levels, fecal calprotectin, histology, fecal metabolomics, and fecal microbiome shifts. The most informative analyses were colonization and shedding of the pathogen, serum cytokines, metabolomics, and targeted metagenomics to determine dysbiosis. Histopathological changes of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and tight junction leakage as measured by fecal calprotectin concentrations were not observed. Chronic dosing was similar to the acute regimen suggesting that a high dose of pathogen, as used in many studies, may not be necessary. The piglet disease model presented here can be used to evaluate alternative PWD treatment options.<sep>Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5 (TGR5) is a receptor for bile acids and its expression has been described in a variety of tissues and species. Characterization of TGR5 distribution and function has been investigated in drug discovery for the treatment of metabolic diseases in humans. Because dogs are one of the species used in biomedical research and share some similarities with human gastrointestinal diseases, the objective of this study was to characterize the distribution of TGR5 receptor in the canine species. This study characterizes the distribution of TGR5 receptor in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas of 8 dogs. The distribution of TGR5 antigen and mRNA expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization, respectively. TGR5 immunolabeling was located in the cell membrane or in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. TGR5 immunolabeling was broadly distributed in macrophages, endothelial cells, ganglion cells, and leiomyocytes throughout all the examined tissues. Epithelial cells from tongue, stomach to rectum, as well as from gallbladder, biliary and pancreatic ducts demonstrated TGR5 immunolabeling. In endocrine cells, TGR5 immunolabeling was observed in intestinal enteroendocrine cells and islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. The hepatocytes had a unique pattern of immunolabeling located on the canalicular surface of the cell membrane. TGR5 mRNA expression was located mainly in the nucleus and the only negative cells throughout all examined tissues were striated muscle from tongue and esophagus, muscularis mucosae, esophageal glands, and hepatic sinusoids. These findings indicate that the bile acid receptor TGR5 is ubiquitously distributed in the canine gastrointestinal tract.<sep>Abstract Post-weaning enteropathies in swine caused by pathogenic E. coli , such as post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) or edema disease (ED), remain a significant problem for the swine industry.

In this study, we attempted to induce clinical signs of post-weaning disease in a piglet model using a one-time acute or lower daily chronic dose of a Shiga toxin–producing and enterotoxigenic E. coli strain. The induced disease state was monitored by determining fecal shedding and colonization of the challenge strain, animal growth performance, cytokine levels, fecal calprotectin, histology, fecal metabolomics, and fecal microbiome shifts. The most informative analyses were colonization and shedding of the pathogen, serum cytokines, metabolomics, and targeted metagenomics to determine dysbiosis. Histopathological changes of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and tight junction leakage as measured by fecal calprotectin concentrations were not observed. Chronic dosing was similar to the acute regimen suggesting that a high dose of pathogen, as used in many studies, may not be necessary. The piglet disease model presented here can be used to evaluate alternative PWD treatment options. Furthermore, this relatively mild disease model presented here may be informative for modeling human chronic gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, which otherwise require invasive procedures for study. Importance Post-weaning diarrhea remains a significant problem in swine production and appropriate models of pathogenesis are needed to test alternative treatment options. In this study, we present an E. coli induced piglet model for post-weaning diarrhea, and also explore its translational potential as a model for human intestinal inflammation. Our study here presents two firsts to our knowledge. 1) The first simultaneous analysis of the intestinal microbiome and metabolome through fecal sampling of piglets challenged with Shiga toxin–producing E. coli . This is valuable given the limited metabolomics data from swine in various disease states. 2) A comparison of the clinical signs caused by a daily chronic vs one-time dosing regimen of E. coli . This comparison is key as infection by pathogenic E. coli in real-world settings likely occurs from chronic exposure to contaminated food, water, or environment rather than the highly concentrated dose of pathogen that is commonly given in the literature.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Fibrosis<sep>Epigenetics<sep>Histone<sep>NADPH oxidase<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Polyphenol<sep>Regulator<sep>Reactive oxygen species<sep>Cancer epigenetics<sep>Inflammation<sep>Ulcerative colitis<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Tryptophan<sep>Sorghum<sep>DNA methylation<sep>Reactive nitrogen species<sep>NOX4<sep>Glutathione peroxidase<sep>Vesicular monoamine transporter 2<sep>Bran<sep>Dopamine<sep>Antioxidant<sep>NOX1<sep>Inoculation<sep>Pseudomonas<sep>Resveratrol<sep>Acetylation<sep>Selenoprotein<sep>Oxidative stress<sep>Chronic granulomatous disease<sep>Inflammatory bowel disease<sep>Salinity<sep>Signal transduction</keyword><title>Redox regulator network in inflammatory signaling<sep>Influence of Pseudomonas spp. on Okra (&lt;i&gt;Abelomuscus esculantaus&lt;/i&gt; L.) growth parameters and antioxidant activities under soil salinity<sep>Colitis susceptibility in mice with reactive oxygen species deficiency is mediated by mucus barrier and immune defense defects<sep>NADPH oxidase 4 is protective and not fibrogenic in intestinal inflammation<sep>Mechanism for antiParkinsonian effect of resveratrol: Involvement of transporters, synaptic proteins, dendrite arborization, biochemical alterations, ER stress and apoptosis<sep>Impact of High-Polyphenol Sorghum Varieties on Expression of Selenoproteins in Human Colon Cancer Cells (P06-047-19)<sep>The Effect of Sorghum Polyphenols on DNA Methylation and Histone Acetylation in Colon Cancer<sep>High‐polyphenol sorghum bran extracts decrease glutathione peroxidase expression and activity in colon cancer celle</title><abstract>Dysregulated redox signaling can exaggerate inflammation, but it is now recognized that reactive species are central mediators to both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes. Signal regulation can occur by direct modification of proteins or lipids, or via the coordinated transfer of electrons between proteins forming a redox relay. Recently the focus shifted from reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to sulfur and carbonyl species in inflammatory signaling. Extensive interplay exists between distinct species, either within individual cells, between distinct cells, or between host cells and microbes. Reactive species act as one highly regulated network regulating inflammatory decision making of the host. Selected examples, mainly in innate immune cells, will be presented, emphasizing the interconnected nature of reactive species during inflammatory signaling.<sep>In this study total twenty seven gram negative NaCl tolerant rhizobacterial strains were isolated from disturbed soils of Lucknow districts. The 3 selected sampling sites were Bijnor, Pasi Quila and Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University Campus, Lucknow, India. The isolates have been investigated for different plant growth promoting and biochemical activities. Based on morphological and biochemical tests the total eight (8) rhizobacterial strains were designated as Pseudomonas spp. Among PGP traits, all 8 Pseudomonas strains were examined for Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA) production activity. The bacterialisolate IAA4 produces maximum 21.16±3.24 μg mL-1 of IAA at 100 μg mL-1 tryptophan concentration among Pseudomonas strains. This strain show excellent P solubilization and N fixatation in qualitative assay. The higher amount of NaCl salt in soils positively reduces paddy plant physiology and growth parameters. The IAA4 inoculation in okra seeds significantly (P&lt;0.001) improved plant growth parameters, green pigments and modulate antioxidant activities under pot experimental study<sep>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidases (NOX/DUOX) provide antimicrobial defense, redox signaling, and gut barrier maintenance. Inactivating NOX variants are associated with comorbid intestinal inflammation in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD; NOX2) and pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; NOX1); however Nox-deficient mice do not reflect human disease susceptibility. Here we assessed if a hypomorphic patient-relevant CGD mutation will increase the risk for intestinal inflammation in mice. Cyba (p22phox) mutant mice generated low intestinal ROS, while maintaining Nox4 function. The Cyba variant caused profound mucus layer disruption with bacterial penetration into crypts, dysbiosis, and a compromised innate immune response to invading microbes, leading to mortality. Approaches used in treatment-resistant CGD or pediatric IBD such as bone marrow transplantation or oral antibiotic treatment ameliorated or prevented disease in mice. The Cyba mutant mouse phenotype implicates loss of both mucus barrier and efficient innate immune defense in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation due to ROS deficiency, supporting a combined-hit model where a single disease variant compromises different cellular functions in interdependent compartments.<sep>Dysregulated redox signaling and oxidative injury are associated with inflammatory processes and fibrosis. H2O2 generation by NOX4 has been suggested as a key driver in the development of fibrosis and a small molecule drug is under evaluation in clinical trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and primary biliary cholangitis. Fibrosis is a common complication in Crohn's disease (CD) leading to stricture formation in 35–40% of patients, who require surgical interventions in the absence of therapeutic options. Here we assess NOX4 expression in CD patients with inflammatory or stricturing disease and examine whether loss of NOX4 is beneficial in acute and fibrotic intestinal disease. NOX4 was upregulated in inflamed mucosal tissue of CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, in CD ileal strictures, and in mice with intestinal inflammation. Nox4 deficiency in mice promoted pathogen colonization and exacerbated tissue injury in acute bacterial and chemical colitis. In contrast, in two chronic injury models aberrant tissue remodeling and fibrosis-related gene expression did not differ substantially between Nox4−/− mice and wildtype mice, suggesting that Nox4 is dispensable in TGF-β1-driven intestinal fibrogenesis. While animal models do not recapitulate all the hallmarks of CD fibrosis, the tissue-protective role of Nox4 warrants a cautious approach to pharmacological inhibitors.<sep>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the mechanism for antiParkinsonian effect of resveratrol employing 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced experimental model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Resveratrol treatment significantly protects the PD related pathological markers like level of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine and apoptotic proteins (Bax and cleaved caspase-3). Disease pathology involves significantly decreased level of dopamine transporter, synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) along with augmented level of vesicular monoamine transporter and considerably affected the dendrite arborization. Such affected neuronal communication was significantly restored with resveratrol treatment. Biochemical alterations include the depleted level of glutathione (GSH), mitochondrial complex-I activity with concomitant increased level of lipid peroxidation, nitrite level and calcium levels, which were also significantly inhibited with resveratrol treatment. Altered calcium level induces the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related signalling and phosphorylated Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and with resveratrol treatment the level of phosphorylated Nrf2 was further increased. The concurrent depleted level of proteasome activity was observed which was attenuated with resveratrol treatment. Proinflammatory cytokines and activated astrocytes were observed which was inhibited with resveratrol treatment. In conclusion, findings suggested that resveratrol exhibits the interference in neuronal communication, oxidative stress, mitochondrial pathophysiology, ER stress, protein degradation mechanism and inflammatory responses and could be utilize in clinics to treat the PD patients.<sep>Plant secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, are found in many fruits, grains, and vegetables, and are thus a part of normal human diet. One such food is sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), a cereal grain that contains varying concentrations of polyphenols. Many polyphenols have been implicated in the regulation of colon cancer through modulating the antioxidant defense, which includes some of the major selenoproteins, e.g., thioredoxin reductases (TXNRD) and glutathione peroxidases (GPX). However, because such redox-active enzymes have been shown to be involved in both cancer prevention and promotion, the goal of our study is to assess the impact of high-polyphenol sorghum extracts on the expression of selenoproteins. Human colon cancer cells (HT29, HCT116) were incubated with 1.25 mg high-polyphenol sorghum bran extract per mL medium for 48 h. RNA was extracted with Trizol/Chloroform, and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. mRNA expression of selenoproteins was quantitated using qPCR, normalized to GAPDH, and analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Protein lysates will be used for Western blotting and catalytic activity assays. Compared to solvent control, incubation of human colon cancer cells with high-polyphenol sorghum extracts for 48 h moderately impacted mRNA expression of investigated selenoproteins. One of the extracts resulted in a nearly doubled GPX1 mRNA expression in HCT116 cells (p = 0.08), whereas preliminary results suggest that TXNRD1 expression may be lowered. High-polyphenol varieties of sorghum may affect selenoprotein expression. Further investigations involving both shorter and longer-term incubation times, as well as effects on protein expression and activity will help elucidate the effects of these new sorghum varieties on selenoprotein expression important in prevention and promotion of colon cancer. Financial support was provided by Towson University’s Fisher College of Science and Mathematics (P. Tsuji) and the USDA (D. Smolensky).<sep>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health issue, accounting for nearly 150,000 cases annually. Because CRC correlates with oxidative stress, exploiting the antioxidative nature of bioactive components in our diet that could potentially inhibit cancer promotion might be beneficial. New varietals of the grain Sorghum bicolor contain high amounts of polyphenols, which may contribute to CRC prevention due to their strong antioxidative and anti-carcinogenic properties. Because gene expression of enzymes may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, we are interested in DNA methylation and histone acetylation patterns of genes, including those enzymes that play a role in the promotion or prevention of CRC. Our objective is to examine how high-polyphenol sorghum varietals impact epigenetic mechanisms in human colon cancer cells. We are currently assessing mRNA and protein expression, catalytic activity of DNA-methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone acetyltransferases, in addition to global DNA methylation and histone acetylation in human HCT116 and CACO-2 colon cancer cells. We treated HCT116 cells with new high-polyphenol or commercially available S. bicolor extracts, solvent control, or 5 μM epigallocatechin gallate as a positive control for up to 48 hours. Total RNA, protein, and DNA were harvested, and mRNA expression of selected genes was quantitated with qPCR, and protein expression is being quantitated with Western blotting. Our preliminary results suggest that high-polyphenol S. bicolor may decrease mRNA expression of DNMT1, the key enzyme that upholds methylation patterns after DNA synthesis. Furthermore, mRNA expression of DNMT3A, the enzyme responsible for de novo DNA methylation, was also decreased. We will further investigate global and gene-specific DNA methylation, and the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis and chemoprevention. Consumption of high-polyphenol S. bicolor as part of the human diet may lead to beneficial changes in chromatin methylation or acetylation. Subsequently, the expression of specific genes involved in the promotion or prevention of colorectal cancer may be modified, providing a dietary intervention to CRC. Towson University.

Sorghum bicoloris a cereal grain that contains varying amounts of polyphenols. Many polyphenols have been implicated in the regulation of colon cancer through modulating cellular antioxidant defense enzymes, which includes the glutathione peroxidases (GPX). These redox-active enzymes protect cells from oxidative stress and are therefore involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis. Because cancer cells are thought to be undergoing oxidative stress, antioxidant defense enzymes, including but not limited to GPX, are often upregulated in those cells, contributing to their survival. The goal of our study is to investigate the impact of high-polyphenol sorghum extracts on the expression and activity of these antioxidant enzymes. Our hypothesis is that glutathione peroxidase expression and catalytic activity will decrease in colon cancer cells treated with high-polyphenol Sorghum extracts, thus potentially presenting a dietary chemoprevention strategy. The USDA ARS Kansas provided us with extracts from high-polyphenol Sorghum bran, labeled 'HP' or 'SC'. Human colon cancer cells (HCT116) were incubated with 1.25 mg extract per mL medium for 24hr hours. Total RNA was isolated with the Trizol method, and reverse transcribed to cDNA. mRNA expression was subsequently quantified using qPCR and normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Catalytic activity of GPX was determined with enzyme specific commercially-available assays that measure the conversion of 1.0 µmol of NADPH to NADP+ . Our preliminary results show that, compared to the solvent control, extract 'HP' slightly and extract 'SC' significantly (p<0.05) decreased mRNA expression of GPX 1 in HTC116 cells. However, GPX2 mRNA was modestly (p>0.05) increased in cells exposed to SC extract. Overall GPX activity, which measures catalytic activity of all present cellular GPXs, was significantly decreased by extracts 'SC' and 'HP'. These results suggest that high polyphenol sorghum extracts may influence gene expression and catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases involved in cellular antioxidant defense, and that GPX activity primarily reflects GPX1 as expected. Further investigation using other cell lines and antioxidant systems may help explain whether and how Sorghum extracts may modulate tumor prevention and promotion.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/505330", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5051245238", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5063281784", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on gastrointestinal tract and microbiome studies, which, while relevant to cell biology, does not directly align with the specific focus on neuronal cell signaling and trafficking in Alzheimer's disease as required by the job description.

We find that investment-cash flow sensitivity is disappearing over time, even for constrained firms during the global financial crisis when credit constraints were more significant or binding. Our results not only confirm the decline in investment-cash flow sensitivity that is not explained by factors so far identified in the literature but also its diminishing usefulness as a proxy of financial constraints.<sep>Reducing the food waste is the greatest challenge in the present times for sustainable food management systems that have significant economic, environmental and social impact on the food supply chain. The Circular Economy (CE) paradigm advocates the concept of the closed-loop economy endorsing more responsible utilization and appropriate exploitation of resources in contrast to the open-ended linear economic system of take-make-use and dispose. This chapter has explored Agri-Food waste in the context of CE, triple bottom line (TBL), and sustainability. An alignment of circular strategies with the food waste hierarchy is proposed that indicates practical application of the gradations of circularity in the food waste management that could lead to the development of sustainable food management system targeting the sustainable development goals of Zero Hunger and Responsible consumption and production. This chapter also highlights some opportunities and challenges of Agri-Food waste in the application of circular bio-economy.<sep>This study aims to examine the direct effect of innovation capability on value creation. The mediating role of frugal innovation and the moderating role of knowledge sharing are also explored between innovation capability and value creation link. This exploratory study uses quantitative and cross-sectional data collected through questionnaires. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine the hypothesis. Findings show a significant positive impact of innovation capability on value creation. Results proved that frugal innovation mediates the relations between innovation capability and value creation. Knowledge sharing strengthens the association between innovation capability and value creation in their association. Our research provides a framework for the sustainable advancement of SMEs in a circular economy and recommends that they increase the value creation of the products/services through frugal innovation based on the innovation capabilities. Moreover, knowledge-sharing practices speed up the interplay between innovation capability and value creation in the circular economy.<sep>Due to technological advancements, all types of businesses confront new opportunities. In the contemporary era of technology, innovation performs a key role in successful commercial landscape operations. Therefore, this research was conducted to examine the effect of the innovation network (IN) on organizational innovativeness (OI). Moreover, the mediating effects of frugal innovation (FI) and the moderating role of organizational readiness (OR) have also been examined. Data collection through a cross-sectional method was conducted for this study from SMEs. Some 442 managers and owners provided correct responses, which were used for further analysis. SEM was used for testing the hypotheses of the current study. The results showed that the innovation network positively affects organizational innovativeness. Furthermore, the outcomes also validated that frugal innovation plays a mediating role between the innovation network and the organizational innovativeness link. The SMEs working in the circular economy are mainly dependent on their innovative activities/actions. In the current dynamic scenario, the survival of SMEs is linked to continuous organizational innovativeness in their products/services.<sep>Given its unsustainable growth, the food packaging industry (FPI) has become a priority industry in the circular economy. Given the academic significance attributed to the gradations of circularity in maximising resource efficiency in the food packaging industry, this paper aims to identify the current state of the application of those gradations of circularity in the FPI by finding the least and most commonly used circular strategies in the FPI. Moreover, it aims to identify the drivers of and barriers to the implementation of the gradations of circularity and the levers for overcoming such barriers through SLR using multiple case studies, namely five small-medium enterprises (SMEs) in the FPI that each represent one of the five least implemented circular strategies. The research identified that the efforts of the FPI toward adopting circular strategies were not aligned with the gradations of circularity. Based on the research findings, a lever–barrier matrix is proposed as a toolkit for SMEs planning a transition toward the circular economy or are in the transition phase.<sep>Modern supply chains are critical in terms of efficiency, economic activities and commercial impact, particularly in case of security incidents. Inland terminals, commercial ports and dry ports constitute key gateways for the transportation flows in these modern supply chains and are require enhanced security procedures. This paper develops a framework that facilitates the sharing of information among various supply chain stakeholders, which is expected to improve the security level from a value chain perspective. In this context, we propose the upgrade of the current security strategies utilising existing processes, equipment in order to minimise time and cost currently needed but more importantly improving the level of security in the supply chain. A conceptual rule and role-based data fusion framework is developed enabling the seamless and timely exchange of messages. The proposed data fusion framework has a simple architecture that supports quick integration to either network-based, distributed systems or conventional stand-alone systems and adheres to common data fusion principles. The proposed framework considers different components (e.g., sensors, algorithms and fusing procedures) in an equipment agnostic approach so as to enable easy access and easy usage of security information.<sep>Several digital technologies are available to facilitate the transition toward a circular supply chain infrastructure. Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) should assess their readiness and measure their performance to select the most appropriate digital technology. This study explores how well-established digital technologies such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Manufacturing (CM), and Big Data Analytics (BDA) impact circular supply chain infrastructure in SMEs. Questionnaires have been distributed to collect employees’ preferences concerning the circular supply chain management criteria (profit, innovation, sustainability, and optimization). The responses have been organized into three clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique is adopted to evaluate these technologies since it constitutes a reliable managerial tool when vagueness impacts the smooth operation of the supply chain. Results indicate the ranking order of the investigated digital technologies (CPS>IoT>CM>BDA) as well as the circular benefits and the supply chain attributes imparted upon implementing these technologies. Such benefits and attributes are provided to assess the impact of these digital technologies on a circular economy. Lastly, the perspective of the selection process affected by other factors, such as the enterprise’s extroversion level and its internal structure, are discussed.<sep>Purpose This study explores how factors arising from supply chain (SC) network and complexity work together in supply chain learning (SCL) behavior. Design/methodology/approach Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, which is an emerging configurational analysis method, was adopted to examine the complex combination of five influencing factors. The data were collected using a two-stage survey. First, the authors selected seven typical firms with an awareness of SCL. Second, questionnaires were sent to the partners of the seven selected firms, and 156 valid questionnaires were obtained from 76 firms. Findings Drawing on emergent insights from the initiative, the authors find that multiple configurations of SC network and complexity lead to high SCL. Specifically, weak ties are necessary conditions of such learning, while strong ties are also conducive to this. Moreover, a moderate SC complexity is conducive to SCL. Practical implications This study enriches the understanding of SCL and provides new insights for SC management practitioners to take measures to improve it. Originality/value This study addresses the lack of in-depth understanding of the antecedent conditions of SCL in the literature. It establishes an integrated and comprehensive theoretical framework of such learning based on contingency theory. Additionally, this study incorporates ambidextrous SCL (i.e. creation capability and dispersion capacity). An overall prototype of SCL capability is proposed on SC network and complexity theory.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Evolutionarily stable strategy<sep>Price discrimination<sep>Unintended consequences<sep>Service quality<sep>Loss aversion<sep>Consumer welfare<sep>Prefrontal cortex<sep>Redevelopment<sep>Outcome (game theory)<sep>Empirical evidence<sep>Cooperative game theory<sep>Common value auction<sep>Auction theory<sep>Vickrey auction<sep>Game theory<sep>Economic surplus<sep>Purchasing<sep>Path dependence<sep>Poverty<sep>Strategic complements<sep>Task (project management)<sep>Ex-ante<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Harm<sep>Obfuscation<sep>CONTEST<sep>Incentive<sep>Path (computing)<sep>Virtuous circle and vicious circle<sep>Ventromedial prefrontal cortex<sep>Variety (cybernetics)<sep>Neuroeconomics<sep>Competition (biology)<sep>Willingness to pay<sep>Nash equilibrium<sep>Underpinning<sep>Product (mathematics)<sep>Service provider<sep>Ventral striatum<sep>Shapley value</keyword><title>Exclusive Data, Price Manipulation and Market Leadership<sep>Evolutionary equilibrium in contests with stochastic participation: Entry, effort and overdissipation<sep>Consumer salience and quality provision in (un)regulated public service markets<sep>Curbing obfuscation: Empower consumers or regulate firms?<sep>Fair shares?

We show that exclusive access to a list of consumers can provide incentives for a firm to endogenously assume the price leader’s role, and so to strategically manipulate its rival’s price. Prices and profits are non-monotonic in the length of the consumer list. For an intermediate size, price leadership entails a semi-collusive outcome, characterized by supra-competitive prices and low consumer surplus. In contrast, for short or long lists of consumers, exclusive data availability intensifies market competition.<sep>This paper examines the evolutionary stability of behaviour in contests where players’ participation can be stochastic. We find, for exogenously given participation probabilities, players exert more effort under the concept of a finite-population evolutionarily stable strategy (FPESS) than under Nash equilibrium (NE). We show that there is ex-ante overdissipation under FPESS for sufficiently large participation probabilities, if, and only if, the impact function is convex. With costly endogenous entry, players enter the contest with a higher probability and exert more effort under FPESS than under NE. Importantly, under endogenous entry, overdissipation can occur for all (Tullock) contest success functions, in particular those with concave impact functions.<sep>This article examines the impacts of publishing quality indicators in publicly financed service markets, such as education and healthcare markets. We set up a model in which the reporting of such indicators increases consumers’ decision weight on quality relative to other attributes (prices and horizontal match), affecting the competition between service providers. We use the model to study the effects in two market environments: markets with regulated prices and markets with unregulated prices. We find that the publication of quality indicators increases quality investments by service providers, but also increases prices and reduces variety. Consumer and total welfare can decrease with such policies, particularly when consumers are heavily subsidised.<sep>This paper develops a market model where consumers refrain from buying products that they are unable to understand and a firm can influence the probability of a consumer understanding its offer. In equilibrium, firms artificially increase product complexity, and firms that offer more transparent products choose on average higher prices. We study two sets of public policies. We show that consumer side policies may have the unintended consequence of encouraging obfuscation while firm side policies are always effective in curbing obfuscation. Interestingly, a consumer side policy can even harm consumers when it protects consumers so much that it greatly increases the marginal effectiveness of obfuscation. Policies on both sides can either increase or decrease social welfare depending on the marginal effectiveness and the marginal cost of obfuscation. Our main insights hold in both asymmetric and symmetric obfuscation equilibria.<sep>Site consolidation is a perennial issue in the study of land economics. The emergence in many contexts of policies that follow variations on ‘land readjustment’ represent a common way for policy makers to overcome the barriers to wholesale redevelopment. In several important respects the nature of the problems that land readjustment seeks to confront are best thought of as questions in cooperative game theory. In this contribution we seek to explore the underpinning logic of land-readjustment using fundamental concepts in cooperative game theory: the Shapley value and the Core. In addition, we present results of an experiment on coalition and value distribution in four European countries. Our results shed light on a range of important practical issues for the policy ranging from the conditions under which development might be self-initiated to coalition stability, and to the value of an animating agency such as urban planning.<sep>How urban economies evolve has a rich literature. The impulse to discern longitudinal patterns of development can be seen in the body of work on path dependence. However, it has been noted that the drivers of path dependence are under-specified. In this paper we seek to make an association between real estate development in England and the longer term path dependence that has bequeathed an extremely geographically unequally pattern of economic development. In so doing we present empirical research from a major study of ‘developer contributions’ that associates behavioural aspects of the planning process through which developer contributions are determined and the creation of virtuous/vicious circles of development. It is our contention that these virtuous and vicious circles represent an important but under-researched aspect of the highly varied path dependencies observed in settings such as England that we describe here as poverty and affluence traps.<sep>Abstract Online retailers often sell products using a socially competitive second‐price sealed‐bid auction known as a Vickrey auction (VA), an incentivized demand‐revealing mechanism used to elicit players' subjective values. The VA presents a situation of risky decision‐making, which typically implements value processing and a loss aversion mechanism. Neural outcome processing of VA bids are not known; this study explores this for the first time using EEG. Twenty‐eight healthy participants bid on household items against an anonymous, computerized opponent. Bid outcome event‐related potentials were predicted to differentiate between three conditions: outbid (no‐win), large margin win (bargain), and small margin win (snatch). Individual loss aversion values were evaluated in a separate behavioral experiment offering gains or losses of variable amounts but equal chances against an assured gain. Processing outcomes of VA bids were associated with a feedback‐related negativity (FRN) potential with a spatial maximum at the vertex (251–271 ms), where bargain win trials resulted in greater FRN amplitudes than snatch win trials. Additionally, a P300 potential was sensitive to win versus no‐win outcomes and to retail price. Individual loss aversion level did not correlate with the strength of FRN or P300. Results show that outcome processing in a VA is associated with FRN that differentiates between relatively advantageous and less advantageous gains, and a P300 that distinguishes between the more and less expensive auction items. Our findings pave the way to an objective exploration of economic decision‐making and purchasing behavior involving a widely popular auction.<sep>Forming and comparing subjective values (SVs) of choice options is a critical stage of decision-making. Previous studies have highlighted a complex network of brain regions involved in this process by utilising a diverse range of tasks and stimuli, varying in economic, hedonic and sensory qualities. However, the heterogeneity of tasks and sensory modalities may systematically confound the set of regions mediating the SVs of goods. To identify and delineate the core brain valuation system involved in processing SV, we utilised the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction, an incentivised demand-revealing mechanism which quantifies SV through the economic metric of willingness-to-pay (WTP). A coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis analysed twenty-four fMRI studies employing a BDM task (731 participants; 190 foci). Using an additional contrast analysis, we also investigated whether this encoding of SV would be invariant to the concurrency of auction task and fMRI recordings. A fail-safe number analysis was conducted to explore potential publication bias. WTP positively correlated with fMRI-BOLD activations in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex with a sub-cluster extending into anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral ventral striatum, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, and right anterior insula. Contrast analysis identified preferential engagement of the mentalizing-related structures in response to concurrent scanning. Together, our findings offer succinct empirical support for the core structures participating in the formation of SV, separate from the hedonic aspects of reward and evaluated in terms of WTP using BDM, and show the selective involvement of inhibition-related brain structures during active valuation.<sep>Abstract Vickrey auctions (VA) and Becker–DeGroot–Marschak auctions (BDM) are strategically equivalent demand‐revealing mechanisms, differentiated only by a human opponent in the VA, and a random‐number‐generator opponent in the BDM. Game parameters are such that players are incentivized to reveal their private subjective values (SV) and behavior should be identical in both tasks. However, this has been repeatedly shown not to be the case. In this study, the neural correlates of outcome feedback processing during VA and BDM were directly compared using electroencephalography. Twenty‐eight healthy participants bid for household products which were then divided into high‐ and low‐SV categories. The VA included a human opponent deception to induce a social environment, while in reality a random‐number‐generator was used in both tasks. A P3 component peaking at 336 ms over midline parietal sites showed more positive amplitudes for high bid values, and for win outcomes in the VA but not the BDM. Both auctions also elicited a Reward Positivity potential, maximal at 275 ms along the central midline electrodes, that was not modulated by auction task or SV. Further, an exploratory N170 potential in the right occipitotemporal electrodes and a vertex positive potential component were stronger in the VA relative to the BDM. Results point to an enhanced cortical response to bid outcomes during VA task in a potential component associated with emotional control, and to the occurrence of face‐sensitive potentials in VA but not in BDM auction. These findings suggest modulation of bid outcome processing by the social‐competitive aspect of auction tasks. Directly comparing two prominent auction paradigms affords the opportunity to isolate the impact of social environment on competitive, risky decision‐making. Findings suggest that feedback processing as early as 176 ms is facilitated by the presence of a human competitor, and later processing is modulated by social context and subjective value.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/178466/senior-lecturer-lecturer-in-international-business-management-/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5001116931", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5075240322", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description through their focus on sustainability, innovation management, and supply chain dynamics, which are highly relevant to International Business Management.

The present study demonstrated the strong antibiofilm and antivirulence efficacy of citral against A. baumannii . In addition, proteomic analysis revealed the multitarget potential of citral against A. baumannii . Furthermore, citral treatment enhances the susceptibility of A. baumannii to the host innate immune system and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The quorum sensing (QS) controlling ability of the E. coli to form biofilms has become one of the important reasons for the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Quorum signaling activation and formation of biofilm lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance of the pathogens increasing the therapy difficult for treating bacterial diseases. There is a crucial need, therefore, to reinforce newer therapeutic designs to overcome this resistance. As the infections caused by E. coli are attributed via the QSregulated biofilm formation, easing this system by QS inhibitors is a possible strategy for treating bacterial diseases. Plant based natural products have been reported to bind to QS receptors and interrupt the QS systems of pathogens by inhibiting biofilm formation and disrupting the formed biofilms, thus minimizing the chances<sep>Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants are simultaneously encountered by environmental stressors, most importantly salinity stress. Salinity is the major hurdle that can negatively impact growth and crop yield. Understanding the salt stress and its associated complex trait mechanisms for enhancing salt tolerance in rice plants would ensure future food security. The main aim of this review is to provide insights and impacts of molecular-physiological responses, biochemical alterations, and plant hormonal signal transduction pathways in rice under saline stress. Furthermore, the review highlights the emerging breakthrough in multi-omics and computational biology in identifying the saline stress-responsive candidate genes and transcription factors (TFs). In addition, the review also summarizes the biotechnological tools, genetic engineering, breeding, and agricultural practicing factors that can be implemented to realize the bottlenecks and opportunities to enhance salt tolerance and develop salinity tolerant rice varieties. Future studies pinpointed the augmentation of powerful tools to dissect the<sep>Plants can be considered to biosynthesize the specialized metabolites to adapt to various environmental stressors mainly on abiotic stresses (AbS). Among specialized metabolites, glutamine (Gln) is an essential plant metabolite to achieve sustainable plant growth, yield and food security. In this pilot study, swe employed computational metabolomics genome wide association survey (cmGWAS) of Gln metabolite profiling in Oryza sativa, targeting at the identification of abiotic stress responsible (AbSR) – Gln metabolite producing genes (GlnMPG). Identified 5 AbSR-GlnMPG alter the metabolite levels and play a predominant role in delineating the physiological significance of rice. These genes were systematically analysed for their biological features via OryzaCyc. Spatio-temporal and plant hormonal expression pattern of AbSR-GlnMPG was analysed and their differential expression profiling were noted in 48 different tissues and hormones, respectively. Furthermore, comparative ideogram of these genes revealed the chromosomal synteny with C4 grass genomes.

Biofilm quantification assay showed antibiofilm efficacy of DD with maximum biofilm inhibition of 85% at 225 μg/mL concentration. Efficacy of antibacterial property of DD (225 μg/mL) was confirmed by CFU analysis and Alamar blue assay. Microscopic analyses evidently confirmed micro-colony formation, biofilm thickness and surface coverage were reduced upon DD treatment. In addition, based on the results of in vitro assays, it was noted that DD impaired the synthesis of surface hydrophobicity, slime, hyaluronic acid, hemolysin and protease production. Interestingly, DD increased the autoaggregation of S. pyogenes hence, facilitated enhanced recognition of clumped bacterial cells for innate immune clearance. The results were further validated by the reduced survival of DD treated S. pyogenes in healthy human blood. Consequently, based on the qPCR analysis DD altered the expression of core regulons<sep>Genes encoding proteins with A20/AN1 zinc-finger domains, belonging to the stress associated protein (SAP) gene family, are present in all eukaryotes and play a decisive role in plant response to diverse physiological and molecular activities particularly on biotic and abiotic stresses (AbS).

Though plants have traditionally been used to treat various diseases, their biological values are not completely explored yet. Sapindus mukorossi is one such ethnobotanical plant identified for various biological activities. As biofilm formation and biofilm mediated drug resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have raised as serious global issue, search for antibiofilm agents has gained greater importance. Notably, antibiofilm potential of S. mukorossi is still unexplored. The aim of the study is to explore the effect of S. mukorossi methanolic extract (SMME) on MRSA biofilm formation and adhesive molecules production. Significantly, SMME exhibited 82 % of biofilm inhibition at 250 μg/mL without affecting the growth and microscopic analyses evidenced the concentration dependent antibiofilm activity of SMME. In vitro assays exhibited the reduction in slime, cell surface hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, extracellular polysaccharides substance and extracellular DNA<sep>Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a predominant human pathogen with high morbidity that is listed in the WHO high priority pathogen list. Being a primary cause of persistent human infections, biofilm forming ability of S. aureus plays a pivotal role in the development of antibiotic resistance. Hence, targeting biofilm is an alternative strategy to fight bacterial infections. The present study for the first time demonstrates the non-antibacterial biofilm inhibitory efficacy of 5-Dodecanolide (DD) against ATCC strain and clinical isolates of S. aureus. In addition, DD is able to inhibit adherence of MRSA on human plasma coated Titanium surface. Further, treatment with DD significantly reduced the eDNA synthesis, autoaggregation, staphyloxanthin biosynthesis and ring biofilm formation. Reduction in staphyloxanthin in turn increased the susceptibility of MRSA to healthy human blood and H2O2 exposure. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed the induced expression of agrA and agrC upon DD treatment. This resulted<sep>Abstract Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) is rising as a human pathogen of critical priority worldwide as it is the leading cause of chronic opportunistic infections in healthcare settings and the condition is ineradicable with antibiotic therapy. AB possesses the ability to form biofilm on abiotic as well as biotic surfaces which plays a major role in its pathogenesis and resistance in clinical settings. Hence, the demand for an alternative therapy to combat the biofilm-associated infections is increasing. The present study explored the antibiofilm potential of myrtenol, a bicyclic monoterpene present in various plants against reference and clinical strains of AB. Myrtenol (200 μg/mL) exhibited a strong antibiofilm activity without exerting any harmful effect on growth and metabolic viability of AB strains. Microscopic analyses confirmed the reduction in the biofilm thickness and surface coverage upon myrtenol treatment. Especially, myrtenol was found to be effective in disrupting the mature biofilms of<sep>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the dangerous human pathogens and it is categorized as a high priority multi-drug resistant bacterium by WHO. Biofilm forming ability of MRSA is responsible for persistent infections and also difficult to eradicate using antibiotic therapy as biofilm is much more resistant to antibiotics. Thus, targeting biofilm and virulence has become an alternative approach to attenuate the pathogenicity of bacterium without affecting the growth. Hence, the present study was aimed at evaluation of antibiofilm potential of citral against MRSA and to decode the possible mode of action. Citral inhibited biofilm formation by MRSA without affecting growth at 100 μg/mL. Microscopic analyses evidenced that citral greatly hampered the surface adherence of MRSA. Effect of citral on cellular proteome of MRSA was studied using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) and differentially regulated proteins were identified using nano LC-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis.

The present study investigated the anti-infective potential of thymol against C. albicans and S. mutans dual species for the management of ECC. Thymol, a plant derivative of the monoterpene group, has been well known for its numerous biological activities. Thymol at 300 μg/ml concentration completely arrested growth and proliferation of dual species of C. albicans and S. mutans. Rapid killing efficacy of pathogens, within a span of 2 min, was observed in the time kill assay. In addition, at sub-inhibitory concentrations, thymol effectively diminished the biofilm formation and virulence of both C. albicans and S. mutans such as yeast-to-hyphal transition, hyphal-to-yeast transition, filamentation, and acidogenicity and acidurity, respectively, in single and dual species state.<sep>The aim of this study was to examine the effect of TNFα (i.e., a predominant proinflammatory cytokine produced during chronic gut inflammation) on colonic uptake of thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) and free thiamin, forms of vitamin B1 that are produced by the gut microbiota and are absorbed via distinct carrier-mediated systems. We utilized human-derived colonic epithelial CCD841 and NCM460 cells, human differentiated colonoid monolayers, and mouse intact colonic tissue preparations together with an array of cellular/molecular approaches in our investigation. The results showed that exposure of colonic epithelial cells to TNFα leads to a significant inhibition in TPP and free thiamin uptake. This inhibition was associated with: 1) a significant suppression in the level of expression of the colonic TPP transporter (cTPPT; encoded by SLC44A4), as well as thiamin transporters-1 & 2 (THTR-1 & -2; encoded by SLC19A2 & SLC19A3, respectively); 2) marked inhibition in activity of the SLC44A4,<sep>Dengue virus enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by a viral envelope (DENVE) protein-mediated membrane fusion. A small detergent molecule n-octyl-β-D-glucoside (βOG) occupies the hydrophobic pocket which is located in the hinge region plays a major role in the rearrangement. It has been reported that mutations occurred in this binding pocket lead to the alterations of pH threshold for fusion. In addition to this event, the protonation of histidine residues present in the hydrophobic pocket would also impart the conformational change of the E protein evidence this pocket as a promising target. The present study identified novel cinnamic acid analogs as significant blockers of the hydrophobic pocket through molecular modeling studies against DENVE. A library of seventy-two analogs of cinnamic acid was undertaken for the discovery process of DENV inhibitors. A Molecular docking study was used to analyze the binding mechanism between these compounds and DENV followed<sep>Staphylococcus aureus is a leading pathogen responsible for mild to severe invasive infections in humans. Especially, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is prevalent in hospital and community associated infections. Staphyloxanthin is a golden yellow color eponymous pigment produced by S. aureus and provides resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and host neutrophil-based killing. In addition, this membrane pigment contributes to membrane rigidity and helps MRSA to survive under stress conditions. Targeting virulence of pathogen without exerting selection pressure is the recent approach to fight bacterial infections without developing drug resistance. The present study for the first time evaluated the staphyloxanthin inhibitory potential of thymol against MRSA. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrated 90% of staphyloxanthin inhibition at 100 µg/mL concentration of thymol without alteration in growth. Molecular docking analysis and in vitro measurement of metabolic intermediates of staphyloxanthin revealed that thymol could possibly interact with CrtM to inhibit staphyloxanthin.<sep>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a serious human pathogen which has been listed as a high-priority multi-drug resistance pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO). Persistent MRSA infections are often associated with biofilm formation and resistance to conventional antimicrobial therapy. Inhibiting the surface adherence and the virulence of the bacterium is the current alternative approach without affecting growth to reduce the possibility of resistance development. Although numerous antibiofilm agents have been identified, their mode of action remains unclear. Combining two drugs with different modes of action will improve the efficiency of the treatment strategy against MRSA. The present study was aimed to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the antibiofilm activity of thymol against MRSA and assess the ability of thymol to improve the antibacterial activity of rifampicin. Thymol significantly inhibited 88% of MRSA biofilm formation at 100 μg/ml and reduced the surface adherence of MRSA on glass, stainless<sep>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a deleterious human pathogen responsible for severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogen has attained high priority in World Health Organization (WHO) – Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens list. Emerging MDR strains of S. aureus is clinically challenging due to failure in conventional antibiotic therapy. Biofilm formation is one of the underlying mechanisms behind the antibiotic resistance. Hence, attenuating biofilm formation has become an alternative strategy to control persistent infections. The current study is probably the first that focuses on the antibiofilm and antivirulence potential of myrtenol against MRSA and its clinical isolates. Myrtenol exhibited a concentration-dependent biofilm inhibition without causing any harmful effect on cell growth and viability. Further, microscopic analysis validated the biofilm inhibitory efficacy of myrtenol against MRSA. In addition, myrtenol inhibited the synthesis of major virulence factors including slime, lipase, α-hemolysin, staphyloxanthin and autolysin. Inhibition of staphyloxanthin, in turn sensitized the<sep>Biomaterial associated microbial infections are complicated and mostly lead to revision surgery or removal which are painful to the patients and quite expensive. These infections are difficult to treat with antibiotics as it is often related to biofilm formation. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the leading pathogen in biomaterial associated infections and well known to form biofilm on foreign materials. To reduce the risk of biomaterial associated infections, recent treatment strategies focus on modification of the implant surface to prevent the adhesion of bacteria. Antibiofilm coating is the effective approach than coating with antimicrobials as antibiofilm agents will not create selective pressure thereby excludes possibility of drug resistance. The current study identified and validated the synergistic antibiofilm activity of citral (CIT) and thymol (THY) by crystal violet quantification and microscopic analysis without alteration in growth and metabolic viability of MRSA. Polymeric antibiofilm coating with CIT + THY<sep>Abstract The principal etiological agent of human dental caries, Streptococcus mutans is a multi-virulent pathogen that can transform commensal oral microbial community to plaque biofilms. Major virulence factors that are associated with the cariogenicity of S. mutans include adhesion, acidogenicity and acidurity. All these pathogenic traits coordinate and alter the dental plaque ecology which provide room for interaction with other similar acidogenic and aciduric bacteria. This cariogenic flora increases the possibility of enamel demineralization which headway to caries development. The present study was aimed at evaluating the antimicrobial and antiinfective potential of a lichen secondary metabolite usnic acid (UA) against S. mutans. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and growth kinetics were evaluated to determine the antimicrobial potential of UA against S. mutans. UA at 5 µg mL −1 and 10 µg mL −1 concentration were considered as MIC and MBC respectively. Effect on biofilm formation<sep>Carvacrol is an essential oil traditionally used in culinary processes as spice due to its aromatic nature and also known for various biological activities. In the present study, the antivirulence efficacy of carvacrol against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is explored. MRSA is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing various superficial and systemic infections in humans. Biofilm formation and virulence factors of MRSA are responsible for its pathogenesis and resistance. Hence, the aim of this study was to explore the antibiofilm and antivirulence efficacy of carvacrol against MRSA. Carvacrol at 75 μg/mL inhibited MRSA biofilm by 93%, and it also decreased the biofilm formation on polystyrene and glass surfaces. Further, microscopic analyses revealed the reduction in microcolony formation and collapsed structure of biofilm upon carvacrol treatment. The growth curve analysis and the Alamar blue assay showed the nonfatal effect of carvacrol on MRSA. Further, carvacrol significantly reduced the production<sep>This study investigated the effect of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on colonic uptake of thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP), the biologically active form of vitamin B1 that is generated by gut microbiota. We used three complementary models in our study: in vitro (human-derived colonic epithelial NCM460), ex vivo (human differentiated colonoid monolayers), and in vivo (mouse colonic tissue). The results showed that exposure of NCM460 cells to LPS leads to a significant inhibition of carrier-mediated TPP uptake as well as in decreased expression of the colonic TPP transporter (cTPPT) protein, mRNA, and heterologous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) compared with untreated controls. Similarly, exposure of human differentiated colonoid monolayers and mice to LPS caused significant inhibition in colonic carrier-mediated TPP uptake and in cTPPT protein, mRNA, and hnRNA expression. The effect of LPS on colonic TPP uptake and cTTPT expression was also found to be associated with a significant reduction in<sep>LPS is a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The gut is exposed to high levels of this endotoxin in conditions such as IBD, necrotizing enterocolitis, and sepsis. LPS affects different aspects of cell physiology including transport at the cell membrane. Effects on the latter, however, are differential; and both induction and inhibition in substrate uptake have been observed. Nothing is currently known about the effect of LPS on colonic uptake of the microbiota-generated forms of vitamin B1, i.e., TPP and free thiamine. We investigated this issue in the current study using human-derived colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, human native differentiated and polarized colonoid monolayers, and mouse intact colonic tissue preparation together with appropriate cellular and molecular approaches. The results showed that exposure of colonic epithelial cells to LPS leads to a significant inhibition in carrier-mediated [3H]-TPP uptake. This inhibition was associated with: (i) a significant</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Transmembrane protein<sep>Programmed cell death<sep>Axoplasmic transport<sep>Ubiquitin<sep>Unfolded protein response<sep>Methylation<sep>Salmonella infection<sep>ATF4<sep>Actin<sep>Receptor<sep>Huntingtin<sep>ULK1<sep>Herpes simplex virus<sep>Postsynaptic potential<sep>Autophagy<sep>Stromal cell<sep>Neurodegeneration<sep>Autophagosome<sep>Extracellular<sep>Ascorbic acid<sep>NPM1<sep>Synapse<sep>Dendritic spine<sep>Membrane protein<sep>Immunohistochemistry<sep>Endosome<sep>BAG3<sep>Mesenchymal stem cell<sep>DNA methylation<sep>Endoplasmic reticulum<sep>ATG8<sep>Transmembrane domain<sep>Serine<sep>Ubiquitin ligase<sep>Salmonella<sep>Arc (geometry)<sep>PTCH1<sep>ATG12<sep>TFEB<sep>Host (biology)<sep>Curvature<sep>Membrane curvature<sep>Phosphorylation<sep>Host response<sep>Gene expression<sep>Leukemia<sep>Gene<sep>Bone marrow<sep>Ovarian cancer<sep>Signal transduction</keyword><title>TBC1D2B undergoes phase separation and mediates autophagy initiation<sep>Curvature induction and membrane remodeling by FAM134B reticulon homology domain assist selective ER-phagy<sep>An atypical GABARAP binding module drives the pro-autophagic potential of the AML-associated NPM1c variant<sep>SIK2 orchestrates actin-dependent host response upon <i>Salmonella</i> infection<sep>TBK1‐mediated phosphorylation of LC3C and GABARAP‐L2 controls autophagosome shedding by ATG4 protease<sep>Heteromeric clusters of ubiquitinated ER-shaping proteins drive ER-phagy<sep>Ubiquitination regulates ER-phagy and remodelling of endoplasmic reticulum<sep>Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Neuronal Infection Triggers the Disassembly of Key Structural Components of Dendritic Spines<sep>Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 neuronal infection triggers disassembly of key structural components of dendritic spines<sep>Impaired intracellular trafficking of sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 contributes to the redox imbalance in Huntington’s disease<sep>Impact of mesenchymal stromal cell–derived vesicular cargo on B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia progression<sep>New insight into the role of PTCH1 protein in serous ovarian carcinomas<sep>ATF4 links ER stress with reticulophagy in glioblastoma cells<sep>New insights into the role of PTCH1 protein in serous ovarian carcinomas</title><abstract>Abstract Small ubiquitin‐like modifiers from the ATG8 family regulate autophagy initiation and progression in mammalian cells. Their interaction with LC3‐interacting region (LIR) containing proteins promotes cargo sequestration, phagophore assembly, or even fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Previously, we have shown that RabGAP proteins from the TBC family directly bind to LC3/GABARAP proteins. In the present study, we focus on the function of TBC1D2B. We show that TBC1D2B contains a functional canonical LIR motif and acts at an early stage of autophagy by binding to both LC3/GABARAP and ATG12 conjugation complexes. Subsequently, TBC1D2B is degraded by autophagy. TBC1D2B condensates into liquid droplets upon autophagy induction. Our study suggests that phase separation is an underlying mechanism of TBC1D2B‐dependent autophagy induction.<sep>Abstract FAM134B/RETREG1 is a selective ER-phagy receptor that regulates the size and shape of the endoplasmic reticulum. The structure of its reticulon-homology domain (RHD), an element shared with other ER-shaping proteins, and the mechanism of membrane shaping remain poorly understood. Using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we assemble a structural model for the RHD of FAM134B. Through MD simulations of FAM134B in flat and curved membranes, we relate the dynamic RHD structure with its two wedge-shaped transmembrane helical hairpins and two amphipathic helices to FAM134B functions in membrane-curvature induction and curvature-mediated protein sorting. FAM134B clustering, as expected to occur in autophagic puncta, amplifies the membrane-shaping effects. Electron microscopy of in vitro liposome remodeling experiments support the membrane remodeling functions of the different RHD structural elements. Disruption of the RHD structure affects selective autophagy flux and leads to disease states.<sep>The nucleolar scaffold protein NPM1 is a multifunctional regulator of cellular homeostasis, genome integrity, and stress response. NPM1 mutations, known as NPM1c variants promoting its aberrant cytoplasmic localization, are the most frequent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A hallmark of AML cells is their dependency on elevated autophagic flux. Here, we show that NPM1 and NPM1c induce the autophagy-lysosome pathway by activating the master transcription factor TFEB, thereby coordinating the expression of lysosomal proteins and autophagy regulators. Importantly, both NPM1 and NPM1c bind to autophagy modifiers of the GABARAP subfamily through an atypical binding module preserved within its N terminus. The propensity of NPM1c to induce autophagy depends on this module, likely indicating that NPM1c exerts its pro-autophagic activity by direct engagement with GABARAPL1. Our data report a non-canonical binding mode of GABARAP family members that drives the pro-autophagic potential of NPM1c, potentially enabling therapeutic options.<sep>Salmonella is an intracellular pathogen of a substantial global health concern. In order to identify key players involved in Salmonella infection, we performed a global host phosphoproteome analysis subsequent to bacterial infection. Thereby, we identified the kinase SIK2 as a central component of the host defense machinery upon Salmonella infection. SIK2 depletion favors the escape of bacteria from the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) and impairs Xenophagy, resulting in a hyperproliferative phenotype. Mechanistically, SIK2 associates with actin filaments under basal conditions; however, during bacterial infection, SIK2 is recruited to the SCV together with the elements of the actin polymerization machinery (Arp2/3 complex and Formins). Notably, SIK2 depletion results in a severe pathological cellular actin nucleation and polymerization defect upon Salmonella infection. We propose that SIK2 controls the formation of a protective SCV actin shield shortly after invasion and orchestrates the actin cytoskeleton architecture in its entirety to control an acute Salmonella infection after bacterial invasion.<sep>Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process through which defective or otherwise harmful cellular components are targeted for degradation via the lysosomal route. Regulatory pathways, involving post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, play a critical role in controlling this tightly orchestrated process. Here, we demonstrate that TBK1 regulates autophagy by phosphorylating autophagy modifiers LC3C and GABARAP-L2 on surface-exposed serine residues (LC3C S93 and S96; GABARAP-L2 S87 and S88). This phosphorylation event impedes their binding to the processing enzyme ATG4 by destabilizing the complex. Phosphorylated LC3C/GABARAP-L2 cannot be removed from liposomes by ATG4 and are thus protected from ATG4-mediated premature removal from nascent autophagosomes. This ensures a steady coat of lipidated LC3C/GABARAP-L2 throughout the early steps in autophagosome formation and aids in maintaining a unidirectional flow of the autophagosome to the lysosome. Taken together, we present a new regulatory mechanism of autophagy, which influences the conjugation and de-conjugation of LC3C and GABARAP-L2 to autophagosomes by TBK1-mediated phosphorylation.<sep>Membrane-shaping proteins characterized by reticulon homology domains play an important part in the dynamic remodelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An example of such a protein is FAM134B, which can bind LC3 proteins and mediate the degradation of ER sheets through selective autophagy (ER-phagy)1. Mutations in FAM134B result in a neurodegenerative disorder in humans that mainly affects sensory and autonomic neurons2. Here we report that ARL6IP1, another ER-shaping protein that contains a reticulon homology domain and is associated with sensory loss3, interacts with FAM134B and participates in the formation of heteromeric multi-protein clusters required for ER-phagy. Moreover, ubiquitination of ARL6IP1 promotes this process. Accordingly, disruption of Arl6ip1 in mice causes an expansion of ER sheets in sensory neurons that degenerate over time. Primary cells obtained from Arl6ip1-deficient mice or from patients display incomplete budding of ER membranes and severe impairment of ER-phagy flux. Therefore, we propose that the clustering of ubiquitinated ER-shaping proteins facilitates the dynamic remodelling of the ER during ER-phagy and is important for neuronal maintenance.<sep>Abstract The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergoes continuous remodelling via a selective autophagy pathway, known as ER-phagy 1 . ER-phagy receptors have a central role in this process 2 , but the regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Here we report that ubiquitination of the ER-phagy receptor FAM134B within its reticulon homology domain (RHD) promotes receptor clustering and binding to lipidated LC3B, thereby stimulating ER-phagy. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed how ubiquitination perturbs the RHD structure in model bilayers and enhances membrane curvature induction. Ubiquitin molecules on RHDs mediate interactions between neighbouring RHDs to form dense receptor clusters that facilitate the large-scale remodelling of lipid bilayers. Membrane remodelling was reconstituted in vitro with liposomes and ubiquitinated FAM134B. Using super-resolution microscopy, we discovered FAM134B nanoclusters and microclusters in cells. Quantitative image analysis revealed a ubiquitin-mediated increase in FAM134B oligomerization and cluster size. We found that the E3 ligase AMFR, within multimeric ER-phagy receptor clusters, catalyses FAM134B ubiquitination and regulates the dynamic flux of ER-phagy. Our results show that ubiquitination enhances RHD functions via receptor clustering, facilitates ER-phagy and controls ER remodelling in response to cellular demands.<sep>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread neurotropic virus. Primary infection of HSV-1 in facial epithelium leads to retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system (CNS) where it establishes latency. Under stressful conditions, the virus reactivates, and new progeny are transported anterogradely to the primary site of infection. During the late stages of neuronal infection, axonal damage can occur, however, the impact of HSV-1 infection on the morphology and functional integrity of neuronal dendrites during the early stages of infection is unknown. We previously demonstrated that acute HSV-1 infection in neuronal cell lines selectively enhances Arc protein expression - a major regulator of long-term synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, known for being a protein-interaction hub in the postsynaptic dendritic compartment. Thus, HSV-1 induced Arc expression may alter the functionality of infected neurons and negatively impact dendritic spine dynamics. In this study we demonstrated that HSV-1 infection induces structural disassembly and functional deregulation in cultured cortical neurons, an altered glutamate response, Arc accumulation within the somata, and decreased expression of spine scaffolding-like proteins such as PSD-95, Drebrin and CaMKIIβ. However, whether these alterations are specific to the HSV-1 infection mechanism or reflect a secondary neurodegenerative process remains to be determined.<sep>ABSTRACT Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread neurotropic virus. The primary infection in facial epithelium leads to retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system (CNS) where it establishes latency. Under stressful conditions, the virus reactivates, and new progeny is transported anterogradely to the primary site of infection. In late stages of neuronal infection, axonal damage is known to occur. However, the impact of HSV-1 infection on morphology and functional integrity at earlier stages of infection in neuronal dendrites is unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that acute HSV-1 infection in neuronal cell lines selectively enhances the expression of Arc protein - a major regulator of long-term synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, known for being a protein-interaction hub in the postsynaptic dendritic compartment. Thus, HSV-1 induced Arc may alter the functionality of the infected neurons having an impact on dendritic spine dynamics. In this study we demonstrated that HSV-1 infection causes structural disassembly and functional deregulation in cultured cortical neurons, through protein homeostasis alteration with intracellular accumulation of Arc, and decreased expression of spine scaffolding-like proteins such as PSD-95, Drebrin and CaMKIIβ. Our findings reveal progressive deleterious effects of HSV-1 infection on excitatory neuronal synapse function and dendritic morphology, supporting the thesis of the infectious origin of neurodegenerative processes.<sep>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine expansion at the first exon of the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed and it is localized in several organelles, including endosomes. HD is associated with a failure in energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant highly concentrated in the brain where it acts as a messenger, modulating neuronal metabolism. It is transported into neurons via the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2). During synaptic activity, ascorbic acid is released from glial reservoirs to the extracellular space, inducing an increase in SVCT2 localization at the plasma membrane. Here, we studied SVCT2 trafficking and localization in HD. SVCT2 is decreased at synaptic terminals in YAC128 male mice. Using cellular models for HD (STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 cells), we determined that SVCT2 trafficking through secretory and endosomal pathways is altered in resting conditions. We observed Golgi fragmentation and SVCT2/Htt-associated protein-1 mis-colocalization. Additionally, we observed altered ascorbic acid-induced calcium signaling that explains the reduced SVCT2 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular ascorbic acid (active conditions) described in our previous results. Therefore, SVCT2 trafficking to the plasma membrane is altered in resting and active conditions in HD, explaining the redox imbalance observed during early stages of the disease.<sep>Leukemia cells reciprocally interact with their surrounding bone marrow microenvironment (BMM), rendering it hospitable to leukemia cell survival, for instance through the release of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). In contrast, we show here that BMM deficiency of pleckstrin homology domain family M member 1 (PLEKHM1), which serves as a hub between fusion and secretion of intracellular vesicles and is important for vesicular secretion in osteoclasts, accelerates murine BCR-ABL1+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) via regulation of the cargo of sEVs released by BMM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). PLEKHM1-deficient MSCs and their sEVs carry increased amounts of syntenin and syndecan-1, resulting in a more immature B-cell phenotype and an increased number/function of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) via focal adhesion kinase and AKT signaling in B-ALL cells. Ex vivo pretreatment of LICs with sEVs derived from PLEKHM1-deficient MSCs led to a strong trend toward acceleration of murine and human BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL. In turn, inflammatory mediators such as recombinant or B-ALL cell-derived tumor necrosis factor α or interleukin-1β condition murine and human MSCs in vitro, decreasing PLEKHM1, while increasing syntenin and syndecan-1 in MSCs, thereby perpetuating the sEV-associated circuit. Consistently, human trephine biopsies of patients with B-ALL showed a reduced percentage of PLEKHM1+ MSCs. In summary, our data reveal an important role of BMM-derived sEVs for driving specifically BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL, possibly contributing to its worse prognosis compared with BCR-ABL1- B-ALL, and suggest that secretion of inflammatory cytokines by cancer cells in general may similarly modulate the tumor microenvironment.<sep>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for normal embryonic development, while its hyperactivation in the adult organism is associated with the development of various cancers. The role of the Hh signaling pathway in ovarian cancer has not been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the present study investigated the role of protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1), a component of the Hh signaling pathway, and changes in the promoter methylation status of the corresponding gene in a cohort of low‑(LGSC) and high‑grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC) and HGSC cell lines (OVCAR8 and OVSAHO). PTCH1 protein expression level was analyzed using immunohistochemistry in tissue samples and immunofluorescence and western blotting in cell lines. DNA methylation patterns of the PTCH1 gene were analyzed using methylation‑specific PCR. PTCH1 protein expression was significantly higher in HGSCs and LGSCs compared with controls (healthy ovaries and fallopian tubes). Similarly, ovarian cancer cell lines exhibited significantly higher PTCH1 protein expression compared with a normal fallopian tube non‑ciliated epithelial cell line (FNE1). PTCH1 protein fragments of different molecular weights were detected in all cell lines, indicating possible proteolytic cleavage of this protein, resulting in the generation of soluble N‑terminal fragments that are translocated to the nucleus. DNA methylation of the PTCH1 gene promoter was exclusively detected in a proportion of HGSC (13.5%) but did not correlate with protein expression. PTCH1 protein was highly expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma tissues and cell lines, while PTCH1 promoter methylation was only detected in HGSC. Further investigation is required to elucidate the possible mechanisms of PTCH1 activation in serous ovarian carcinomas.<sep>Selective degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; reticulophagy) is a type of autophagy involved in the removal of ER fragments. So far, amino acid starvation as well as ER stress have been described as inducers of reticulophagy, which in turn restores cellular energy levels and ER homeostasis. Here, we explored the autophagy-inducing mechanisms that underlie the autophagic cell death (ACD)-triggering compound loperamide (LOP) in glioblastoma cells. Interestingly, LOP triggers upregulation of the transcription factor ATF4, which is accompanied by the induction of additional ER stress markers. Notably, knockout of ATF4 significantly attenuated LOP-induced autophagy and ACD. Functionally, LOP also specifically induces the engulfment of large ER fragments within autophagosomes and lysosomes as determined by electron and fluorescence microscopy. LOP-induced reticulophagy and cell death are predominantly mediated through the reticulophagy receptor RETREG1/FAM134B and, to a lesser extent, TEX264, confirming that reticulophagy receptors can promote ACD. Strikingly, apart from triggering LOP-induced autophagy and ACD, ATF4 is also required for LOP-induced reticulophagy. These observations highlight a key role for ATF4, RETREG1 and TEX264 in response to LOP-induced ER stress, reticulophagy and ACD, and establish a novel mechanistic link between ER stress and reticulophagy, with possible implications for additional models of drug-induced ER stress.Abbreviations: ACD: autophagic cell death; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; ATL3: atlastin 3; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; CCPG1: cell cycle progression gene 1; co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation; DDIT3/CHOP: DNA damage inducible transcript 3; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; EIF2A/eIF2α: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A; EIF2AK3/PERK: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3; ERN1/IRE1α: endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GBM: glioblastoma multiforme; HSPA5/BiP: heat shock protein family (Hsp70) member 5; LOP: loperamide; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; RETREG1/FAM134B: reticulophagy regulator 1; RTN3L: reticulon 3 long; SEC62: SEC62 homolog, protein translocation factor; TEX264: testis-expressed 264, reticulophagy receptor; UPR: unfolded protein response.<sep>Abstract Background The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for normal embryonic development, while its hyperactivation in adult organism is associated with development of various cancers, including ovarian cancer. The role of the Hh signaling pathway in ovarian cancer, as well as in certain histological subtypes of ovarian cancer, is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of PTCH1 protein and changes in the promoter methylation status of the corresponding gene, in a cohort of low- (LGSC) and high-grade (HGSC) serous ovarian carcinomas and HGSC cell lines (OVCAR5, OVCAR8 and OVSAHO). Methods PTCH1 protein expression level was analyzed using immunohistochemistry in tissue samples, and by immunofluorescence and Western blot in cell lines. DNA methylation pattern of PTCH1 gene were analyzed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences in expression of PTCH1 protein among ovarian tumor samples compared with normal tissue samples, while Spearman’s correlation was used to test the association between DNA promoter methylation of the PTCH1 gene and expression of the corresponding protein. Results PTCH1 protein expression level was significantly higher in HGSCs and LGSCs compared with control tissues (healthy ovaries and fallopian tubes). Similarly, cancer cell lines exhibited significantly higher PTCH1 protein expression in comparison with normal fallopian tube non-ciliated epithelium cell line (FNE1). Nuclear localization of the PTCH1 protein in tumor tissue and cultured tumor cells suggests that this protein could play an active tumor promoter role in the nuclei of serous ovarian carcinoma cells. PTCH1 protein fragments of different molecular weights were detected in the cell lines, indicating possible proteolytic cleavage of this protein, resulting in the generation of soluble N-terminal fragments that are translocated to the nucleus. DNA methylation of the PTCH1 gene promoter was not in line with the expression level of this protein, suggesting that possibly other mechanisms, either epigenetic or posttranslational, regulate PTCH1 gene expression and protein level in serous ovarian carcinomas. Conclusions Our results indicate that PTCH1 protein could play an active tumor promoter role in the pathogenesis of serous ovarian carcinoma.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/85815/associate-full-professor-of-plant-molecular-biology-and-physiology/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5048307387", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5031204345", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on plant molecular biology, particularly in the context of desert plants and haline stress, which aligns closely with the job description.

The purpose of this study is to investigate clinical features and outcomes of macular splitting RD.This was a retrospective case series performed at a single practice. Macular splitting RD was identified clinically and on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Primary outcomes were anatomical and functional success, and secondary outcomes were factors associated with postoperative visual acuity.The overall number of patients with OCT-confirmed macular splitting RD was 16 of 664, which is an incidence rate of 2.4%. Preoperative and final logMAR were 0.33 and 0.13, respectively (P = .002). Presenting visual acuity (VA) (P = 0.015) and duration of symptoms (P = .007) were associated with final VA, whereas time to surgery was not significant (P = .581).The incidence of macular splitting RD is higher than previously reported. Anatomical and functional outcomes were excellent in this study.

It is often associated with atherosclerotic risk factors, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and a history of cerebrovascular disease. CRAO often leads to a poor visual outcome as well as neovascularization of the iris, retina, and optic disc, which can exacerbate vision loss and cause pain. While there are several treatment modalities for CRAO, few have been proven to be effective in decreasing the effects of neovascularization. The use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy is often used in the treatment of CRAO due to its ease of use and relatively benign side effect profile. This study aims to assess the degree of improvement in visual acuity (VA) and neovascularization following HBO2. Our data ultimately shows that 20% of patients developed neovascularization after HBO2 compared to 29.8% of those who did not undergo HBO2 (p&lt;.05). Our findings suggest that HBO2 has a statistically significant protective effect against neovascularization and may improve long-term visual acuity.<sep>Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a condition that causes sudden vision loss due to obstruction of the retinal artery, typically from a thrombotic or embolic source.

A database was created on all patients with a primary RRD from 2010 to 2018 based on billing code 67108. Eyes anatomically eligible for PnR were reviewed for preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative characteristics. The main outcome assessed was single surgery anatomical success (SSAS), final anatomical success (FAS), and postoperative LogMAR vision.A total of 720 eyes (age, 62.9 ± 9.1 years; 61.7% were male) met inclusion criteria for PnR and underwent PPV. SSAS was 94.0% and FAS was 99.9%. Preoperative and final LogMAR vision was 0.853 and 0.293 (P<0.001) in eyes with SSAS vs 0.714 and 0.648 (P=0.686) in eyes with primary failure. PVR was the most common etiology of primary surgical failure (n=21, 49%). Patients who failed primary repair had a mean of 1.12 additional surgeries with a median time of 45 days between surgeries.A robust single surgery success rate with good visual outcomes was achieved across 8 years and multiple surgeons utilizing PPV to treat primary RRDs in eyes which anatomically qualified for pneumatic retinopexy in a real-world setting.<sep>Abstract To compare the effectiveness of self- retained cryopreserved AM as an adjuvant therapy for infectious corneal ulcers. Retrospective, case–control study of 24 eyes of 24 consecutive patients with central and paracentral corneal infectious ulcers and initial visual acuity worse than 20/200. Among them, 11 eyes of 11 patients received additional placement of self-retained cryopreserved AM. Epithelialization and Best Corrected Snellen Visual Acuity (BCSVA) were compared between the two groups. At baseline, both groups had comparable age, gender, visual acuity (VA), size and location of corneal ulcer. Patients receiving additional placement of cryopreserved AM had significantly faster epithelialization within 3.56 ± 1.78 weeks vs 5.87 ± 2.20 weeks ( p = 0.01) and achieved complete epithelialization in significantly more patients (72.7% vs 23.1% p = 0.04) despite overall larger baseline defect size (32.7 ± 19.5 mm 2 vs 21.5 ± 10.7 mm 2 , p = 0.11). Consequently, the AM group had clinically significant BCSVA (&gt; 3 lines) (81.8% vs 38.4%, p = 0.047) and total VA improvement (log MAR 0.7 ± 0.6 vs 1.6 ± 0.9, p = 0.016) compared to the control group at the time of complete epithelialization. In-office sutureless AM may be an effective adjuvant therapy in treating sight-threatening infectious corneal ulcers by promoting faster corneal epithelialization and overall better recovery of the VA.<sep>Purpose: Report the frequency of differing etiologies of endophthalmitis at the Upstate Medical University, and compare these results to previously reported data. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted based on the medical records of all patients diagnosed with endophthalmitis at the Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York between January 2014 to December 2019. Variables recorded included source of infection, microbial profiles, comorbidities, visual acuity and survival. Results: The study identified 62 patients who were diagnosed with endophthalmitis at the Upstate Medical University from January 2014 to December 2019. The most common etiology was endogenous endophthalmitis with 40 cases (64.5%), of these patients, 13 (32.5%) were culture positive. The remaining 22 cases (35.5%) were due to exogenous endophthalmitis. The mean age of patients with endogenous endophthalmitis was 51.4 years with 65.0% as male. The mean age of patients with exogenous endophthalmitis was 59.5 years with 59.1% as male. The most common identifiable risk factor associated with endogenous endophthalmitis was a history of intravenous drug use seen in 47.5%. Conclusion: Endogenous source was established as the most common etiology in patients diagnosed with endophthalmitis. These results, however, do not parallel with any of the previously reported data where endogenous etiology was identified as one of least common causes. The significance of demonstrating this increase in incidence of endogenous endophthalmitis is to illustrate a shift in paradigm and create awareness among ophthalmologists to avoid overlooking a possible life-threatening condition.<sep>To describe vision-threatening complications after micropulse diode transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC).Retrospective case series. Medical charts of patients who underwent MP-TSCPC and developed visually significant inflammation and hyphema after the procedure were reviewed. Patients were seen at the Upstate Medical University Ophthalmology clinic between 2017 and 2019.Out of 64 patients who underwent MP-TSCPC in the defined time period, 2 patients with postprocedure severe inflammation and hyphema were identified. One patient had severe-stage primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). After MP-TSCPC, the patient was noted to have a large visually significant anterior chamber reaction and hyphema that occupied 80% of the anterior chamber on postprocedure day 1. The patient was treated with topical and oral corticosteroids, and topical atropine. The second patient had uncontrolled severe-stage POAG. The patient underwent MP-TSCPC. After the procedure, the patient was noted to have significant inflammation with fibrin and hyphema that filled 80% of the anterior chamber. The patient was treated with topical steroids.As with any intervention, complications are inevitable. Recognition of complications and its possible associations allow for better and more individualized risk versus benefit analysis of an intervention. In this case series, exuberant anterior segment inflammation and hyphema occurred in 2 patients who underwent MP-TSCPC. The authors' goal is to raise awareness of severe anterior chamber inflammation and hyphema as complications occurring after laser treatment with a reputation of minimal or no side-effect profile and to better understand this relatively new laser advancement in the treatment of glaucoma.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/517196", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5022985898", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5088053742", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong research background in cancer biology, molecular medicine, and pathology, with extensive publications in areas such as cancer metastasis, autophagy, and molecular pathways, aligning well with the research-focused aspects of the position.

However, direct empirical support for these evolutionary consequences of spatial heterogeneity comes from simplified laboratory environments. Here we address how spatial structure, through its effect on resource heterogeneity, alters diversification and adaptive evolution of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in an ecologically relevant context: soil-based compost. Our data show that environmental heterogeneity can both promote phenotypic diversification and accelerate adaptation. These results suggest that environmental disturbance, which can decrease spatial heterogeneity, may limit diversification and adaptation of microbial populations.<sep>Abstract Long‐term capture–mark–recapture data provide valuable information on the movements of individuals between locations, and the contemporary and/or co‐located captures of individuals can be used to approximate the social structure of populations. We introduce an r package (CMR net ) that generates social and movement networks from spatially explicit capture–mark–recapture data. It also provides functions for network and datastream permutations for these networks. Here we describe the package and key considerations for its application, providing two example case studies. The conversion of spatially explicit mark–recapture data into social and movement networks will provide insights into the interplay between demography and behaviour in wild animal populations, with<sep>In an era of unprecedented environmental change, there have been increasing ecological and global public health concerns associated with exposure to anthropogenic pollutants. While there is a pressing need to remediate polluted ecosystems, human intervention might unwittingly oppose selection for natural detoxification, which is primarily carried out by microbes. We test this possibility in the context of a ubiquitous chemical remediation strategy aimed at targeting metal pollution: the addition of lime-containing materials. Here, we show that raising pH by liming decreased the availability of toxic metals in acidic mine-degraded soils, but as a consequence selected against microbial taxa that naturally remediate soil through the production of<sep>Abstract Spatial resource heterogeneity is expected to be a key driver for the evolution of diversity. However, direct empirical support for this prediction is limited to studies carried out in simplified laboratory environments. Here, we investigate how altering spatial heterogeneity of potting compost—by the addition of water and mixing—affects the evolutionary diversification of a bacterial species, Pseudomonas fluorescens , that is naturally found in the environment. There was a greater propensity of resource specialists to evolve in the unmanipulated compost, while more generalist phenotypes dominated the compost–water mix. Genomic data were consistent with these phenotypic findings. Competition experiments strongly suggest these results are due to diversifying<sep>Community coalescence, the mixing of different communities, is widespread throughout microbial ecology. Coalescence can result in approximately equal contributions from the founding communities or dominance of one community over another. These different outcomes have ramifications for community structure and function in natural communities, and the use of microbial communities in biotechnology and medicine. However, we have little understanding of when a particular outcome might be expected. Here, we integrate existing theory and data to speculate on how a crucial characteristic of microbial communities—the type of species interaction that dominates the community—might affect the outcome of microbial community coalescence. Given the often comparable timescales of microbial ecology<sep>Abstract The ability of species to mutually invade from rare is the defining measure of species coexistence. However, it is unknown whether invasion growth rates predict any characteristic of long-term community dynamics. Here, we use a model five-species microbial community to investigate the link between short-term growth rate and long-term relative abundance. We manipulated diversity and tested the ability of species to coexist in different combinations. Across all diversity levels and species combinations, populations re-established from rare in 71 of 75 combinations and all combinations were stable in long-term culture. Moreover, short-term relative invader growth rate was positively associated with long-term equilibrium proportion, despite large variation<sep>There exists an enormous diversity of bacteria capable of human infection, but no up-to-date, publicly accessible list is available. Combining a pragmatic definition of pathogenicity with an extensive search strategy, we report 1513 bacterial pathogens known to infect humans described pre-2021. Of these, 73 % were regarded as established (have infected at least three persons in three or more references) and 27 % as putative (fewer than three known cases). Pathogen species belong to 10 phyla and 24 classes scattered throughout the bacterial phylogeny. We show that new human pathogens are discovered at a rapid rate. Finally, we discuss how our results could be expanded to<sep>Abstract Interspecific coevolutionary interactions can result in rapid biotic adaptation, but most studies have focused only on species pairs. Here, we (co)evolved five microbial species in replicate polycultures and monocultures and quantified local adaptation. Specifically, growth rate assays were used to determine adaptations of each species’ populations to (1) the presence of the other four species in general and (2) sympatric vs allopatric communities. We found no evidence for general biotic adaptation: ancestral, polyculture- and monoculture-evolved populations did not have significantly different growth rates when measured within communities. However, 4/5 species’ growth rates were significantly lower within the community they evolved in. This “local maladaptation” suggests<sep>Disturbances can facilitate biological invasions, with the associated increase in resource availability being a proposed cause. Here, we experimentally test the effects of disturbance regime and resource abundance on invasion success. We invaded populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens with two invader morphotypes in a factorial design containing five disturbance frequencies and three resource levels. As resident populations were altered by the treatments, we additionally tested their effect on invader success. Disturbance frequency and resource abundance interacted to affect the success of both invaders. For one, success was positively affected by disturbance under high resources but negatively under low. For the other, disturbance negatively affected success<sep>Infections with bacteria that gained resistance to antibiotics are taking millions of lives annually, with the death toll predicted to increase. River microbial communities act as a first defense barrier against the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) that enter the environment through wastewater after enrichment in human and animal microbiomes. The global increase in temperature due to climate change might disrupt this barrier effect by altering microbial community structure and functions. We consequently explored how increasing temperatures alter ARG spread in river microbial communities. At higher temperatures, naturally occurring ARGs increased in relative abundance. However, this coincided with a decreased success rate of invading foreign<sep>Abstract Interspecific coevolutionary interactions can result in rapid biotic adaptation, but most studies have focused only on species pairs. Here, we (co)evolved five microbial species in replicate polycultures and monocultures and quantified local adaptation. Specifically, growth rate assays were used to determine adaptations of each species’ populations to (1) the presence of the other four species in general and (2) sympatric vs . allopatric communities. We found that species did not show an increase in net biotic adaptation:ancestral, polyculture‐ and monoculture‐evolved populations did not have significantly different growth rates within communities. However, 4/5 species’ growth rates were significantly lower within the community they evolved in relative<sep>Rapid within-species evolution can alter community structure, yet the mechanisms underpinning this effect remain unknown. Populations that rapidly evolve large amounts of phenotypic diversity are likely to interact with more species and have the largest impact on community structure. However, the evolution of phenotypic diversity is, in turn, influenced by the presence of other species. Here, we investigate how microbial community structure changes as a consequence of rapidly evolved within-species diversity using Pseudomonas fluorescens as a focal species. Evolved P. fluorescens populations showed substantial phenotypic diversification in resource-use (and correlated genomic change) irrespective of whether they were pre-adapted in isolation or in a community context. Manipulating<sep>Abstract Microbes can invade as whole communities, but the ecology of whole community invasions are poorly understood. Here, we investigate how invader frequency affects the composition and function of invaded laboratory methanogenic communities. An invading community was equally successful at establishing itself in a resident community regardless of initial invader frequency, which varied between 0.01 and 10%. Invasion resulted in enhanced biogas production (to the level of the pure invading community), but only when invader frequency was 1% or greater. This inconsistency between invasion success and changes in function can be explained by a lower number of invading taxa (but not individuals) at lower initial invader<sep>Microbes can invade as whole communities, but the ecology of whole community invasions is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how invader propagule pressure (the number of invading organisms) affects the composition and function of invaded laboratory methanogenic communities.

Invasion resulted in enhanced biogas production (to the level of the pure invading community) but only when propagule pressure was 1% or greater. This inconsistency between invasion success and changes in function can be explained by a lower richness of<sep>Engineered ecosystems span multiple volume scales, from a nano-scale to thousands of cubic metres. Even the largest industrial systems are tested in pilot scale facilities. But does scale affect outcomes? Here we look at comparing different size laboratory anaerobic fermentors to see if and how the volume of the community affects the outcome of community coalescence (combining multiple communities) on community composition and function. Our results show that there is an effect of scale on biogas production. Furthermore, we see a link between community evenness and volume, with smaller scale communities having higher evenness. Despite those differences, the overall patterns of community coalescence are very similar<sep>Abstract Thermal performance curves (TPCs) are used to predict changes in species interactions, and hence range shifts, disease dynamics and community composition, under forecasted climate change. Species interactions might in turn affect TPCs. Here, we investigate whether temperature-dependent changes in a microbial host-parasite interaction (the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens , and its bacteriophage, SBWФ2) changes the host TPC. The bacteriophage had a narrower infectivity range, with their critical thermal maximum ∼6°C lower than those at which the bacteria still had high growth. Consequently, in the presence of phage, the host TPC had a higher optimum temperature and a lower maximum growth rate. These changes were driven by<sep>Thermal performance curves (TPCs) are used to predict changes in species interactions, and hence, range shifts, disease dynamics and community composition, under forecasted climate change. Species interactions might in turn affect TPCs. Here, we investigate how temperature-dependent changes in a microbial host-parasite interaction (the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, and its lytic bacteriophage, SBW[Formula: see text]) changes the host TPC and the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying these changes. The bacteriophage had a narrower thermal tolerance for infection, with their critical thermal maximum ~6 °C lower than those at which the bacteria still had high growth. Consequently, in the presence of phage, the host TPC changed, resulting in<sep>Increasing environmental concentrations of metals as a result of anthropogenic pollution are significantly changing many microbial communities. While there is evidence metal pollution can result in increased antibiotic resistance, the effects of metal pollution on the virulence of bacterial communities remains largely undetermined. Here, we experimentally test whether metal stress alters the virulence of bacterial communities. We do this by incubating three wastewater influent communities under different environmentally relevant copper concentrations for three days. We then quantify the virulence of the community phenotypically using the Galleria mellonella infection model, and test if differences are due to changes in the rate of biomass accumulation (productivity), copper resistance,<sep>Abstract Prokaryote diversity makes up most of the tree of life and is crucial to the functioning of the biosphere and human health. However, the patterns and mechanisms of prokaryote diversification have received relatively little attention compared to animals and plants. Adaptive radiation, the rapid diversification of an ancestor species into multiple ecologically divergent species, is a fundamental process by which macrobiological diversity is generated. Here, we discuss whether ecological opportunity could lead to similar bursts of diversification in bacteria. We explore how adaptive radiations in prokaryotes can be kickstarted by horizontally acquired key innovations allowing lineages to invade new niche space that subsequently is partitioned<sep>With rising antibiotic resistance, modern medicine needs new approaches for tackling bacterial infections. Phage therapy uses the viruses of pathogenic bacteria to clear the infection. Unlike antibiotics, phage can evolve if bacteria become resistant to maintain or even increase their infectivity (coevolution). While laboratory studies can give insight into complex bacteria-phage interactions, whether they act as a true representation of phage therapy in patients is unknown. Here, we compared phage therapy in a patient to that of in vitro experiments. The patient had been admitted with aPseudomonas aeruginosainfection and was successfully treated with a phage cocktail. Bacteria were isolated before and during phage therapy, allowing us<sep>A number of experimental studies have demonstrated that phytoplankton can display rapid thermal adaptation in response to warmed environments. While these studies provide insight into the evolutionary responses of single species, they tend to employ different experimental techniques. Consequently, our ability to compare the potential for thermal adaptation across different, ecologically relevant, species remains limited. Here, we address this limitation by conducting simultaneous long-term warming experiments with the same experimental design on clonal isolates of three phylogenetically diverse species of marine phytoplankton; the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp., the prasinophyte Ostreococcus tauri and the diatom Phaeodoactylum tricornutum. Over the same experimental time period, we observed differing levels of<sep>Abstract Prokaryotes dominate the Tree of Life, but our understanding of the macroevolutionary processes generating this diversity is still limited. Habitat transitions are thought to be a key driver of prokaryote diversity, but we still know relatively little about how prokaryotes successfully transition and persist across environments, and how this varies between biomes and lineages. Here, we investigate biome transitions and specialisation in natural populations of a focal bacterial phylum, the Myxococcota , sampled across a range of replicated soils and freshwater and marine sediments in Cornwall (UK). By targeted deep sequencing of the protein-coding gene rpoB , we found &gt;2000 unique Myxococcota lineages, with the<sep>Abstract The quantification of thermal performance curves (TPCs) for biological rates has many applications to problems such as predicting species’ responses to climate change. There is currently no widely used open-source pipeline to fit mathematical TPC models to data, which limits the transparency and reproducibility of the curve fitting process underlying applications of TPCs. We present a new pipeline in R that currently allows for reproducible fitting of 24 different TPC models using non-linear least squares (NLLS) regression. The pipeline consists of two packages – rTPC and nls. multstart – that allow multiple start values for NLLS fitting and provides helper functions for setting start parameters.<sep>With rising antibiotic resistance, there has been increasing interest in treating pathogenic bacteria with bacteriophages (phage therapy). One limitation of phage therapy is the ease at which bacteria can evolve resistance. Negative effects of resistance may be mitigated when resistance results in reduced bacterial growth and virulence, or when phage coevolves to overcome resistance. Resistance evolution and its consequences are contingent on the bacteria-phage combination and their environmental context, making therapeutic outcomes hard to predict. One solution might be to conduct 'in vitro evolutionary simulations' using bacteria-phage combinations from the therapeutic context. Overall, our aim was to investigate parallels between in vitro experiments and in vivo<sep>Disturbances can facilitate biological invasions, with the associated increase in resource availability being a proposed cause. Here, we experimentally tested the interactive effects of disturbance regime (different frequencies of biomass removal at equal intensities) and resource abundance on invasion success using a factorial design containing five disturbance frequencies and three resource levels.

The dynamics of coevolution-notably whether host or parasite has an evolutionary advantage-is greatly affected by the relative amount of genetic variation in host resistance and parasite infectivity traits. While studies have manipulated genetic diversity during coevolution, such as by increasing mutation rates, it is unclear how starting genetic diversity affects host-parasite coevolution. Here, we (co)evolved the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and two bacteriophage genotypes of its lytic phage SBW25ɸ2 in isolation (one phage genotype) and together (two phage genotypes). Bacterial populations rapidly evolved phage<sep>Abstract Quantifying thermal performance curves (TPCs) for biological rates has many applications to important problems such as predicting responses of biological systems—from individuals to communities—to directional climate change or climatic fluctuations. Current software tools for fitting TPC models to data are not adequate for dealing with the immense size of new datasets that are increasingly becoming available. We require tools capable of tackling this issue in a simple, reproducible and accessible way. We present a new, reproducible pipeline in r that allows for relatively simple fitting of 24 different TPC models using nonlinear least squares (NLLS) regression. The pipeline consists of two packages— rTPC and nls.multstart<sep>Accumulation of plastics in the marine environment has widespread detrimental consequences for ecosystems and wildlife. Marine plastics are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria, including human pathogens, posing potential risks to health. Here, we investigate the effect of polymer type, residence time and estuarine location on bacterial colonisation of common household plastics, including pathogenic bacteria. We submerged five main household plastic types: low-density PE (LDPE), high-density PE (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at an estuarine site in Cornwall (U.K.) and tracked bacterial colonisation dynamics. Using both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, we found that bacteria rapidly colonised plastics irrespective of<sep>In ecosystems, the efficiency of energy transfer from resources to consumers determines the biomass structure of food webs. As a general rule, about 10% of the energy produced in one trophic level makes it up to the next1–3. Recent theory suggests that this energy transfer could be further constrained if rising temperatures increase metabolic growth costs4, although experimental confirmation in whole ecosystems is lacking. Here we quantify nitrogen transfer efficiency—a proxy for overall energy transfer—in freshwater plankton in artificial ponds that have been exposed to seven years of experimental warming. We provide direct experimental evidence that, relative to ambient conditions, 4 °C of warming can decrease<sep>Abstract River microbial communities regularly act as the first defense barrier against the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) that enter environmental microbiomes through wastewaters. However, how the invasion dynamics of wastewater-born ARGs into river biofilm communities will shift due to increasing average and peak temperatures worldwide through climate change remains unknown. Here we aimed at elucidating the effects of increasing temperatures on both, the natural river biofilm resistome, as well as the river biofilms invadability by foreign, wastewater-born ARGs. To achieve this, natural biofilms were grown in a pristine German river and transferred to artificial laboratory recirculation flume systems at three different temperatures (20°C, 25°C,<sep>Abstract Monitoring postrelease establishment and movement of animals is important in evaluating conservation translocations. We translocated 39 wild pine martens Martes martes (19 females, 20 males) from Scotland to Wales. We released them into forested areas with no conspecifics in 2015, followed by a second release in 2016, alongside the previously released animals. We used radio‐tracking to describe postrelease movement and habitat selection. Six martens (15%) were not re‐encountered during the tracking period, of which four undertook long‐distance dispersal. For the remaining individuals, we characterized two phases of movement, “exploration” followed by “settlement,” that differed between releases. In the first release, martens remained in exploration phase<sep>Releasing gamebirds in large numbers for sport shooting may directly or indirectly influence the abundance, distribution and population dynamics of native wildlife. The abundances of generalist predators have been positively associated with the abundance of gamebirds. These relationships have implications for prey populations, with the potential for indirect impacts of gamebird releases on wider biodiversity. To understand the basis of these associations, we investigated variation in territory size, prey provisioning to chicks, and breeding success of common buzzards Buteo buteo, and associations with variation in the abundances of free-roaming gamebirds, primarily pheasants Phasianus colchicus, and of rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and field voles Microtus agrestis, as important</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Phytoremediation<sep>Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)<sep>Brain size<sep>Environmental remediation<sep>Agriculture<sep>Leaching (pedology)<sep>Copy-number variation<sep>Biobank<sep>Psychosis<sep>Heavy metals</keyword><title>Schizophrenia-associated genomic copy number variants and subcortical brain volumes in the UK Biobank<sep>18THE EFFECT OF CARRYING SCHIZOPHRENIA PENETRANT CNVS ON SUBCORTICAL BRAIN ANATOMY</title><abstract>Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder for which anatomical brain alterations have been repeatedly reported in clinical samples. Unaffected at-risk groups have also been studied in an attempt to identify brain changes that do not reflect reverse causation or treatment effects. However, no robust associations have been observed between neuroanatomical phenotypes and known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. We tested subcortical brain volume differences between 49 unaffected participants carrying at least one of the 12 copy number variants associated with schizophrenia in UK Biobank and 9063 individuals who did not carry any of the 93 copy number variants reported to be pathogenic. Our results show that CNV carriers have reduced volume in some of the subcortical structures previously shown to be reduced in schizophrenia. Moreover, these associations partially accounted for the association between pathogenic copy number variants and cognitive impairment, which is one of the features of schizophrenia.<sep>Remediation and utilization of fly ash (FA) through ecologically and socioeconomically valuable plants are a safe and sustainable approach, considered as the phytomanagement of FA. Disposal of huge amount of FA not only requires large amount of water, energy, and thousands acres of land but also poses significant environmental and socioeconomic problems including health risk by airborne ash particles and leaching of heavy metals in the nearby surroundings. Micro- and macronutrient enriched FA is a good and cost-effective soil ameliorant for plant growth and establishment. However, nitrogen and carbon may be supplemented due to the absence in FA. Use of FA in agriculture may be unsafe due to the presence of heavy metals, but its use for the production of economically valuable nonedible crops would be an ideal approach along with carbon sequestration as a consequence lessens the climate change impact. In this chapter, we propose the phytomanagement of FA with economic returns by using economically valuable crops and discuss the prospects of the utilization of phytoproducts during the phytoremediation of FA/agricultural uses of FA. This chapter assessed the SWOT analysis of phytoproduct production from FA through phytomanagement approach that can generate billion dollars as economic returns and provide a sustainable way of FA use having ecological and socioeconomic benefits.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/22269/lecturer-in-physical-education-with-qts-/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5039934979", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5036796096", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on microbial ecology, evolution, and environmental remediation, which is not directly aligned with the Physical Education and QTS requirements of the job.

Not everyone was supposed to publicly disseminate their theological writings, and successful publishing required connections to those in authority. The texts examined were written for different audiences and for different purposes, educational and controversial. Several of these treatises are connected to discussions in the 850s about the soul. Their analysis demonstrates how thinking about whether or in what sense they were published deepens our understanding of the nature of those discussions.<sep>Early medieval Christian cultures found important roles for dreams and visions, while at the same time perpetuating learned traditions advising suspicion of dreams and warning of the dangers of the wrong kinds of dreams. This article examines prohibitions against the heeding or interpretation of dreams and the transmission of these prohibitions in early medieval normative sources (canonical collections, penitentials, and royal and episcopal capitularies). It argues that such prohibitions were less likely related to any non‐Christian practices involving dreams than they were motivated by a need to define conceptual places for Christian dreaming. On the one side lay concerns about dreams arising from patristic writings, chiefly those of Gregory the Great; on the other was the importance of dreams in Christian cult and thought.<sep>This chapter discusses Pope Gregory the Great’s ideas about visions and the afterlife, and how they were received in the early middle ages. To provide a fuller picture of Gregory’s ideas about afterlife visions, the chapter discusses his thought more generally about visions and dreams, especially the two main themes of this thought: the nature of dreams and visions, as ways through which invisible realities might be perceived; and the nature of afterlife visions, especially whether they represented the afterlife allegorically or as it was. The reception of Gregory’s ideas was influenced by the existing tradition of narrating afterlife visions and the way his works were excerpted and abbreviated to suit new needs. This process made Gregory known both as a proponent of the reality of visions and the author of a teaching critical of dreams, and his Dialogues an influential source of imagery for afterlife visions.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Chromothripsis<sep>Death-associated protein 6<sep>Genome<sep>Whole genome sequencing<sep>PTEN<sep>Hypoxia (environmental)<sep>Cancer genome sequencing<sep>ATRX<sep>Structural variation<sep>Cancer genetics<sep>Exome<sep>Exome sequencing<sep>Somatic cell<sep>Tumour heterogeneity<sep>Gene<sep>Telomere<sep>Germline mutation</keyword><title>Sex differences in oncogenic mutational processes<sep>Retrospective evaluation of whole exome and genome mutation calls in 746 cancer samples<sep>Divergent mutational processes distinguish hypoxic and normoxic tumours<sep>Genomic footprints of activated telomere maintenance mechanisms in cancer<sep>Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes</title><abstract>Sex differences have been observed in multiple facets of cancer epidemiology, treatment and biology, and in most cancers outside the sex organs. Efforts to link these clinical differences to specific molecular features have focused on somatic mutations within the coding regions of the genome. Here we report a pan-cancer analysis of sex differences in whole genomes of 1983 tumours of 28 subtypes as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium. We both confirm the results of exome studies, and also uncover previously undescribed sex differences. These include sex-biases in coding and non-coding cancer drivers, mutation prevalence and strikingly, in mutational signatures related to underlying mutational processes. These results underline the pervasiveness of molecular sex differences and strengthen the call for increased consideration of sex in molecular cancer research.<sep>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) curated consensus somatic mutation calls using whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), respectively. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumour types, we compare WES and WGS side-by-side from 746 TCGA samples, finding that ~80% of mutations overlap in covered exonic regions. We estimate that low variant allele fraction (VAF < 15%) and clonal heterogeneity contribute up to 68% of private WGS mutations and 71% of private WES mutations. We observe that ~30% of private WGS mutations trace to mutations identified by a single variant caller in WES consensus efforts. WGS captures both ~50% more variation in exonic regions and un-observed mutations in loci with variable GC-content. Together, our analysis highlights technological divergences between two reproducible somatic variant detection efforts.<sep>Many primary tumours have low levels of molecular oxygen (hypoxia), and hypoxic tumours respond poorly to therapy. Pan-cancer molecular hallmarks of tumour hypoxia remain poorly understood, with limited comprehension of its associations with specific mutational processes, non-coding driver genes and evolutionary features. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancers across 38 tumour types, we quantify hypoxia in 1188 tumours spanning 27 cancer types. Elevated hypoxia associates with increased mutational load across cancer types, irrespective of underlying mutational class. The proportion of mutations attributed to several mutational signatures of unknown aetiology directly associates with the level of hypoxia, suggesting underlying mutational processes for these signatures. At the gene level, driver mutations in TP53, MYC and PTEN are enriched in hypoxic tumours, and mutations in PTEN interact with hypoxia to direct tumour evolutionary trajectories. Overall, hypoxia plays a critical role in shaping the genomic and evolutionary landscapes of cancer.<sep>Cancers require telomere maintenance mechanisms for unlimited replicative potential. They achieve this through TERT activation or alternative telomere lengthening associated with ATRX or DAXX loss. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, we dissect whole-genome sequencing data of over 2500 matched tumor-control samples from 36 different tumor types aggregated within the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium to characterize the genomic footprints of these mechanisms. While the telomere content of tumors with ATRX or DAXX mutations (ATRX/DAXXtrunc) is increased, tumors with TERT modifications show a moderate decrease of telomere content. One quarter of all tumor samples contain somatic integrations of telomeric sequences into non-telomeric DNA. This fraction is increased to 80% prevalence in ATRX/DAXXtrunc tumors, which carry an aberrant telomere variant repeat (TVR) distribution as another genomic marker. The latter feature includes enrichment or depletion of the previously undescribed singleton TVRs TTCGGG and TTTGGG, respectively. Our systematic analysis provides new insight into the recurrent genomic alterations associated with telomere maintenance mechanisms in cancer.<sep>Abstract Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at the whole-genome scale 1–3 . Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4–5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter 4 ; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation 5,6 ; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution 7 ; describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity 8,9 ; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes 8,10–18 .</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/298389/post-doctoral-researcher-in-transcriptomics-of-plant-programmed-cell-death/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5059454977", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5034333954", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on medieval society and theological texts, which is not aligned with the plant molecular biology and transcriptomics focus required for the post-doctoral researcher position.

Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is the major component of Lewy bodies in PD patients, and impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been linked to its accumulation. In this work, we developed a tetracycline-inducible expression system, with simultaneous induced expression of α-syn-EGFP and a bright red fluorescent protein marker (mCherry) to screen for potential compounds for degrading α-syn. We identified canthin-6-one as an α-syn lowering compound which promoted both wild type and mutants α-syn degradation in an ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS) dependent manner. By CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening technology, we identified RPN2/PSMD1, the 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 1, as the targeting gene for pharmacological activity of canthin-6-one. Finally, we showed that canthin-6-one up-regulates PSMD1 and enhances UPS function by activating PKA.<sep>Parkinson's disease (PD) ranks second among the most common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons. Various cross-species preclinical models, including cellular models and animal models, have been established through the decades to study the etiology and mechanism of the disease from cell lines to nonhuman primates. These models are aimed at developing effective therapeutic strategies for the disease. None of the current models can replicate all major pathological and clinical phenotypes of PD. Selection of the model for PD largely relies on our interest of study. In this review, we systemically summarized experimental PD models, including cellular and animal models used in preclinical studies, to understand the pathogenesis of PD. This review is intended to provide current knowledge about the application of these different PD models, with focus on their strengths and limitations with respect to their contributions to the assessment of the molecular pathobiology of PD and identification of the therapeutic strategies for the disease.<sep>A reduced removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is common to aging and age-related neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strategies for treating such impaired mitophagy would benefit from the identification of mitophagy modulators. Here we report the combined use of unsupervised machine learning (involving vector representations of molecular structures, pharmacophore fingerprinting and conformer fingerprinting) and a cross-species approach for the screening and experimental validation of new mitophagy-inducing compounds. From a library of naturally occurring compounds, the workflow allowed us to identify 18 small molecules, and among them two potent mitophagy inducers (Kaempferol and Rhapontigenin). In nematode and rodent models of AD, we show that both mitophagy inducers increased the survival and functionality of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons, abrogated amyloid-β and tau pathologies, and improved the animals' memory. Our findings suggest the existence of a conserved mechanism of memory loss across the AD models, this mechanism being mediated by defective mitophagy. The computational-experimental screening and validation workflow might help uncover potent mitophagy modulators that stimulate neuronal health and brain homeostasis.<sep>Abstract Autophagy, a conserved cellular degradation and recycling process, can be enhanced by nutrient depletion, oxidative stress or other harmful conditions to maintain cell survival. 6-Hydroxydopamine/ascorbic acid (6-OHDA/AA) is commonly used to induce experimental Parkinson’s disease (PD) lesions by causing oxidative damage to dopaminergic neurons. Activation of autophagy has been observed in the 6-OHDA-induced PD models. However, the mechanism and exact role of autophagy activation in 6-OHDA PD model remain inconclusive. In this study, we report that autophagy was triggered via mucolipin 1/calcium/calcineurin/TFEB (transcription factor EB) pathway upon oxidative stress induced by 6-OHDA/AA. Interestingly, overexpression of TFEB alleviated 6-OHDA/AA toxicity. Moreover, autophagy enhancers, Torin1 (an mTOR-dependent TFEB/autophagy enhancer) and curcumin analog C1 (a TFEB-dependent and mTOR-independent autophagy enhancer), significantly rescued 6-OHDA/AA-induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells, iPSC-derived DA neurons and mice nigral DA neurons. The behavioral abnormality of 6-OHDA/AA-treated mice can also be rescued by Torin 1 or C1 administration. The protective effects of Torin 1 and C1 can be blocked by autophagy inhibitors like chloroquine (CQ) or by knocking down autophagy-related genes TFEB and ATG5. Taken together, this study supports that TFEB-mediated autophagy is a survival mechanism during oxidative stress and pharmacological enhancement of this process is a neuroprotective strategy against oxidative stress-associated PD lesions.<sep>Rationale: Impairment of autophagy maturation has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the mechanism for this impairment has not been elucidated, and whether enhancing autophagy maturation is a viable therapeutic strategy for AD has not been verified. Methods: We examined the autophagosome maturation process in AD cell and mouse models by immunoblotting. To further understand the changes in autophagy in AD brains, we analyzed the transcriptome by RNA-sequencing and measured the expression of RAB7, CCZ1 and MON1A. We performed brain stereotaxic injections of AAV into 3xTg AD mouse brain and WT mouse brain to over-express MON1A/CCZ1 or knockdown MON1A. For in vitro studies, we purified autophagosomes, and determined GTP-RAB7 level in autophagosome fractions by GST-R7BD affinity-isolation assay. Results: We report that the active form of RAB7 was selectively decreased in autophagosome fractions isolated from cells and tissues of AD models, and that this decrease was accompanied by impaired activity of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GFE) CCZ1-MON1A. Overexpressing CCZ1-MON1A increased the active form of RAB7, enhanced autophagosome maturation, and promoted degradation of APP-CTFs, Aβ and P-tau in an autophagy-dependent manner in cells and a mouse AD model. Conclusions: Our data reveals that CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 complex dysfunction is a potential mechanism for autophagosome maturation defects in AD, and advances the possibility that enhancing autophagosome maturation is a novel therapeutic strategy against AD.<sep>Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from various Berberis species which is widely used in East Asia for a wide range of symptoms. Recently, neuroprotective effects of berberine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models are being extensively reported. So far, no clinical trial has been carried out on the neuroprotective effects of berberine. However, a review of the experimental data is needed before choosing berberine as a candidate drug for clinical experiments. We conducted a systematic review on AD rodent models to analyze the drug effects with minimal selection bias.Five online literature databases were searched to find publications reporting studies of the effect of berberine treatment on animal models of AD. Up to March 2018, 15 papers were identified to describe the efficacy of berberine.The included 15 articles met our inclusion criteria with different quality ranging from 3 to 5. We analyzed data extracted from full texts with regard to pharmacological effects and potential anti-Alzheimer's properties. Our analysis revealed that in multiple memory defects animal models, berberine showed significant memory-improving activities with multiple mechanisms, such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition and anti-amyloid effects.AD is likely to be a complex disease driven by multiple factors. Yet, many therapeutic strategies based on lowering β-amyloid have failed in clinical trials. This suggest that the threapy should not base on a single cause of Alzheimer's disease but rather a number of different pathways that lead to the disease. Overall we think that berberine can be a promising multipotent agent to combat Alzheimer's disease.<sep>Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative motor disorders, and is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies containing misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) and by selective degeneration of midbrain dopamine neurons. Studies have shown that upregulation of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) activity promotes the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins such as α-syn and Tau, so as to alleviate the neuropathology of neurodegenerative diseases. To identify and investigate lycorine as a UPS enhancer able to decrease α-syn in transgenic PD models. Dot blot was used to screen α-syn-lowering compounds in an inducible α-syn overexpression cell model. Inducible wild-type (WT) and mutant α-syn-overexpressing PC12 cells, WT α-syn-overexpressing N2a cells and primary cultured neurons from A53T transgenic mice were used to evaluate the effects of lycorine on α-syn degradation in vitro. Heterozygous A53T transgenic mice were used to evaluate the effects of lycorine on α-syn degradation in vivo. mCherry-GFP-LC3 reporter was used to detect autophagy-dependent degradation. Ub-R-GFP and Ub-G76V-GFP reporters were used to detect UPS-dependent degradation. Proteasome activity was detected by fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (Suc-LLVY-AMC). Lycorine significantly promoted clearance of over-expressed WT and mutant α-syn in neuronal cell lines and primary cultured neurons. More importantly, 15 days’ intraperitoneal administration of lycorine effectively promoted the degradation of α-syn in the brains of A53T transgenic mice. Mechanistically, lycorine accelerated α-syn degradation by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to promote proteasome activity. Lycorine is a novel α-syn-lowering compound that works through PKA-mediated UPS activation. This ability to lower α-syn implies that lycorine has the potential to be developed as a pharmaceutical for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, associated with UPS impairment and protein aggregations.<sep>Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-dependent progressive movement disorder characterized by a profound and selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Accumulation of <alpha>-synuclein (<alpha>-syn) positive protein aggregates in the substantia nigra is a pathological hallmark of PD, indicating that protein turnover defect is implicated in PD pathogenesis.This study aims to identify neuroprotective compounds which can alleviate the accumulation of <alpha>-syn in neuronal cells and dissect the underlying mechanisms.High throughput screening was performed by dot blot assay. The degradation of different forms of <alpha>-syn by candidate compounds were assessed by western blot. The autophagy lysosome pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome system were examined to dissect the degradation pathway. The UPS activity was assessed by cellular UPS substrates degradation assay and biochemical proteasome activity assay. Q-PCR was performed to test the mRNA level of different proteasome subunits. Furthermore, Neuroprotective effect of candidate compound was tested by LDH assay and PI staining.Through the high throughput screening, harmine was identified as a potent <alpha>-syn lowering compound. The time-dependent and dose-dependent effects of harmine on the degradation of different forms of <alpha>-syn were further confirmed. Harmine could dramatically promote the degradation of UPS substrates GFP-CL1, Ub-R-GFP and Ub-G76V-GFP, and activate cellular proteasome activity. Mechanistically, harmine dramatically enhanced PKA phosphorylation to enhance proteasome subunit PSMD1 expression. PKA inhibitor blocked the effects of harmine in activating UPS, up regulating PSMD1 and promoting <alpha>-syn degradation, indicating that harmine enhances UPS function via PKA activation. Moreover, harmine efficiently rescued cell death induced by over-expression of <alpha>-syn, via UPS-dependent manner.Harmine, as a new proteasome enhancer, may have potential to be developed into therapeutic agent against neurodegenerative diseases associated with UPS dysfunction and aberrant proteins accumulation.<sep>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-factorial neurodegenerative disease affecting motor function of patients. The hall markers of PD are dopaminergic neuron loss in the midbrain and the presence of intra-neuronal inclusion bodies mainly composed of aggregation-prone protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn). Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a multi-step reaction process responsible for more than 80% intracellular protein degradation. Impairment of UPS function has been observed in the brain tissue of PD patients. PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to activate cAMP-PKA pathway and promote UPS activity in Alzheimer's disease model. α-mangostin is a natural xanthonoid with broad biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial and antitumour activities. Structure-based optimizations based on α-mangostin produced a potent PDE4 inhibitor, 4e. Herein, we studied whether 4e could promote proteasomal degradation of α-syn in Parkinson's disease models through PKA activation.cAMP Assay was conducted to quantify cAMP levels in samples. Model UPS substrates (Ub-G76V-GFP and Ub-R-GFP) were used to monitor UPS-dependent activity. Proteasome activity was investigated by short peptide substrate, Suc-LLVY-AMC, cleavage of which by the proteasome increases fluorescence sensitivity. Tet-on WT, A30P, and A53T α-syn-inducible PC12 cells and primary mouse cortical neurons from A53T transgenic mice were used to evaluate the effect of 4e against α-syn in vitro. Heterozygous A53T transgenic mice were employed to assess the effect of 4e on the clearance of α-syn in vivo, and further validations were applied by western blotting and immunohistochemistry.Taken together, α-mangostin derivative 4e, a PDE4 inhibitor, efficiently activated the cAMP/PKA pathway in neuronal cells, and promoted UPS activity as evidenced by enhanced degradation of UPS substrate Ub-G76V-GFP and Ub-R-GFP, as well as elevated proteasomal enzyme activity. Interestingly, 4e dramatically accelerated degradation of inducibly-expressed WT and mutant α-syn in PC12 cells, in a UPS dependent manner. Besides, 4e consistently activated PKA in primary neuron and A53T mice brain, restored UPS inhibition and alleviated α-syn accumulation in the A53T mice brain.4e is a natural compound derived highly potent PDE4 inhibitor. We revealed its potential effect in promoting UPS activity to degrade pathogenic proteins associated with PD.<sep>NRBF2 is a component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex. Our previous study has revealed its role in regulating ATG14-associated PtdIns3K activity for autophagosome initiation. In this study, we revealed an unknown mechanism by which NRBF2 modulates autophagosome maturation and APP-C-terminal fragment (CTF) degradation. Our data showed that NRBF2 localized at autolysosomes, and loss of NRBF2 impaired autophagosome maturation. Mechanistically, NRBF2 colocalizes with RAB7 and is required for generation of GTP-bound RAB7 by interacting with RAB7 GEF CCZ1-MON1A and maintaining the GEF activity. Specifically, NRBF2 regulates CCZ1-MON1A interaction with PI3KC3/VPS34 and CCZ1-associated PI3KC3 kinase activity, which are required for CCZ1-MON1A GEF activity. Finally, we showed that NRBF2 is involved in APP-CTF degradation and amyloid beta peptide production by maintaining the interaction between APP and the CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 module to facilitate the maturation of APP-containing vesicles. Overall, our study revealed a pivotal role of NRBF2 as a new RAB7 effector in modulating autophagosome maturation, providing insight into the molecular mechanism of NRBF2-PtdIns3K in regulating RAB7 activity for macroautophagy/autophagy maturation and Alzheimer disease-associated protein degradation..Abbreviations: 3xTg AD, triple transgenic mouse for Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid beta peptide; Aβ1-40, amyloid beta peptide 1-40; Aβ1-42, amyloid beta peptide 1-42; AD, Alzheimer disease; APP, amyloid beta precursor protein; APP-CTFs, APP C-terminal fragments; ATG, autophagy related; ATG5, autophagy related 5; ATG7, autophagy related 7; ATG14, autophagy related 14; CCD, coiled-coil domain; CCZ1, CCZ1 homolog, vacuolar protein trafficking and biogenesis associated; CHX, cycloheximide; CQ, chloroquine; DAPI, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; dCCD, delete CCD; dMIT, delete MIT; FYCO1, FYVE and coiled-coil domain autophagy adaptor 1; FYVE, Fab1, YGL023, Vps27, and EEA1; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GDP, guanine diphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GTP, guanine triphosphate; GTPase, guanosine triphosphatase; HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting; ILVs, endosomal intralumenal vesicles; KD, knockdown; KO, knockout; LAMP1, lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; MAP1LC3/LC3, microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MLVs, multilamellar vesicles; MON1A, MON1 homolog A, secretory trafficking associated; NRBF2, nuclear receptor binding factor 2; PtdIns3K, class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; RILP, Rab interacting lysosomal protein; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; SQSTM1/p62, sequestosome 1; UVRAG, UV radiation resistance associated; VPS, vacuolar protein sorting; WT, wild type.<sep>NRBF2, a regulatory subunit of the ATG14-BECN1/Beclin 1-PIK3C3/VPS34 complex, positively regulates macroautophagy/autophagy. In this study, we report that NRBF2 is required for the clearance of apoptotic cells and alleviation of inflammation during colitis in mice. NRBF2-deficient mice displayed much more severe colitis symptoms after the administration of ulcerative colitis inducer, dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS), accompanied by prominent intestinal inflammation and apoptotic cell accumulation. Interestingly, we found that nrbf2-/- mice and macrophages displayed impaired apoptotic cell clearance capability, while adoptive transfer of nrbf2+/+ macrophages to nrbf2-/- mice alleviated DSS-induced colitis lesions. Mechanistically, NRBF2 is required for the generation of the active form of RAB7 to promote the fusion between phagosomes containing engulfed apoptotic cells and lysosomes via interacting with the MON1-CCZ1 complex and regulating the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of the complex. Evidence from clinical samples further reveals the physiological role of NRBF2 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. In biopsies of UC patient colon, we observed upregulated NRBF2 in the colon macrophages and the engulfment of apoptotic cells by NRBF2-positive cells, suggesting a potential protective role for NRBF2 in UC. To confirm the relationship between apoptotic cell clearance and IBD development, we compared TUNEL-stained cell counts in the UC with UC severity (Mayo Score) and observed a strong correlation between the two indexes, indicating that apoptotic cell population in colon tissue correlates with UC severity. The findings of our study reveal a novel role for NRBF2 in regulating apoptotic cell clearance to restrict intestinal inflammation.Abbreviation: ANOVA: analysis of variance; ATG14: autophagy related 14; ATG16L1: autophagy related 16-like 1 (S. cerevisiae); BMDM: bone marrow-derived macrophage; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CD: Crohn disease; CD68: CD68 molecule; CFP: cyan fluorescent protein; CMFDA: 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; CPR: C-reactive protein; Cy7: cyanine 7 maleimide; DAB: diaminobezidine 3; DAI: disease activity indexes; DAPI: 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMEM: dulbecco's modified eagle's medium; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; DOC: sodium deoxycholate; DSS: dextran sulfate sodium; EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; EGTA: ethylenebis (oxyethylenenitrilo) tetraacetic acid; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; FRET: Förster resonance energy transfer; GDP: guanine dinucleotide phosphate; GEF: guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GTP: guanine trinucleotide phosphate; GWAS: genome-wide association studies; HEK293: human embryonic kidney 293 cells; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; IgG: immunoglobin G; IL1B/IL-1β: interleukin 1 beta; IL6: interleukin 6; IRGM: immunity related GTPase M; ITGAM/CD11b: integrin subunit alpha M; KO: knockout; LRRK2: leucine rich repeat kinase 2; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MOI: multiplicity of infection; MPO: myeloperoxidase; NaCl: sodium chloride; NEU: neutrophil; NOD2: nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2; NP40: nonidet-P40; NRBF2: nuclear receptor binding factor 2; PBS: phosphate buffer saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PE: P-phycoerythrin; PIK3C3/VPS34: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBST: tris-buffered saline Tween-20; Tris-HCl: trihydroxymethyl aminomethane hydrochloride; TUNEL: TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; UC: ulcerative colitis; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WB: western blotting; WT: wild type; YFP: yellow fluorescent protein.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/256319/assistant-professor-in-sport-coaching-physical-education-and-sports-science-academic-group-/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5061826936", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5061974001", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on RNA biology and mRNA biogenesis, which is not directly aligned with the requirements of the Assistant Professor in Sport Coaching role, whereas Candidate B's research on neurodegenerative diseases, drug discovery, and neuroprotection, particularly in the context of Parkinson's disease, aligns more closely with the secondary area of expertise in sport psychology and the broader field of sport science.\n\nPreferred: B\n\nConfidence score: 90", "created": 1737537042, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 87, "prompt_tokens": 6814, "total_tokens": 6901, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 6750}, "comparison": "Candidate A's research focuses on RNA biology and mRNA biogenesis, which is not directly aligned with the requirements of the Assistant Professor in Sport Coaching role, whereas Candidate B's research on neurodegenerative diseases, drug discovery, and neuroprotection, particularly in the context of Parkinson's disease, aligns more closely with the secondary area of expertise in sport psychology and the broader field of sport science.", "preferred": "B", "confidence_score": 90, "passage_rank1": 8, "passage_rank2": 38}

Here, we demonstrate that circadian clocks within the brain and heart set daily rhythms in sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) node activity, and impose a time-of–day dependent susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia. Critically, the balance of circadian inputs from the autonomic nervous system and cardiomyocyte clock to the SA and AV nodes differ, and this renders the cardiac conduction system sensitive to decoupling during abrupt shifts in behavioural routine and sleep-wake timing. Our findings reveal a functional segregation of circadian control across the heart’s conduction system and inherent susceptibility to arrhythmia.<sep>Between 6-20% of the cellular proteome is under circadian control and tunes mammalian cell function with daily environmental cycles. For cell viability, and to maintain volume within narrow limits, the daily variation in osmotic potential exerted by changes in the soluble proteome must be counterbalanced. The mechanisms and consequences of this osmotic compensation have not been investigated before. In cultured cells and in tissue we find that compensation involves electroneutral active transport of Na+, K+, and Cl- through differential activity of SLC12A family cotransporters. In cardiomyocytes ex vivo and in vivo, compensatory ion fluxes confer daily variation in electrical activity. Perturbation of soluble protein abundance has commensurate effects on ion composition and cellular function across the circadian cycle. Thus, circadian regulation of the proteome impacts ion homeostasis with substantial consequences for the physiology of electrically active cells such as cardiomyocytes.<sep>Abstract The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock is critical for optimising daily cycles in mammalian physiology and behaviour. The roles of the various SCN cell types in communicating timing information to downstream physiological systems remain incompletely understood, however. In particular, while vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) signalling is essential for SCN function and whole animal circadian rhythmicity, the specific contributions of VIP cell output to physiological control remains uncertain. Here we reveal a key role for SCN VIP cells in central clock output. Using multielectrode recording and optogenetic manipulations, we show that VIP neurons provide coordinated daily waves of GABAergic input to target cells across the paraventricular hypothalamus and ventral thalamus, supressing their activity during the mid to late day. Using chemogenetic manipulation, we further demonstrate specific roles for this circuitry in the daily control of heart rate and corticosterone secretion, collectively establishing SCN VIP cells as influential regulators of physiological timing.<sep>Chronic inflammation underpins many human diseases. Morbidity and mortality associated with chronic inflammation are often mediated through metabolic dysfunction. Inflammatory and metabolic processes vary through circadian time, suggesting an important temporal crosstalk between these systems. Using an established mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, we show that chronic inflammatory arthritis results in rhythmic joint inflammation and drives major changes in muscle and liver energy metabolism and rhythmic gene expression. Transcriptional and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed alterations in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function associated with increased EGFR-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Metabolomic analyses confirmed rhythmic metabolic rewiring with impaired β-oxidation and lipid handling and revealed a pronounced shunt toward sphingolipid and ceramide accumulation. The arthritis-related production of ceramides was most pronounced during the day, which is the time of peak inflammation and increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation. Thus, our data demonstrate that localized joint inflammation drives a time-of-day–dependent build-up of bioactive lipid species driven by rhythmic inflammation and altered EGFR-STAT signaling.<sep>In mammals, endogenous circadian clocks sense and respond to daily feeding and lighting cues, adjusting internal ∼24 h rhythms to resonate with, and anticipate, external cycles of day and night. The mechanism underlying circadian entrainment to feeding time is critical for understanding why mistimed feeding, as occurs during shift work, disrupts circadian physiology, a state that is associated with increased incidence of chronic diseases such as type 2 (T2) diabetes. We show that feeding-regulated hormones insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) reset circadian clocks in vivo and in vitro by induction of PERIOD proteins, and mistimed insulin signaling disrupts circadian organization of mouse behavior and clock gene expression. Insulin and IGF-1 receptor signaling is sufficient to determine essential circadian parameters, principally via increased PERIOD protein synthesis. This requires coincident mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, increased phosphoinositide signaling, and microRNA downregulation. Besides its well-known homeostatic functions, we propose insulin and IGF-1 are primary signals of feeding time to cellular clocks throughout the body.<sep>Abstract Cellular circadian rhythms confer temporal organisation upon physiology that is fundamental to human health. Rhythms are present in red blood cells (RBCs), the most abundant cell type in the body, but their physiological function is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel biochemical assay for haemoglobin (Hb) oxidation status which relies on a redox‐sensitive covalent haem‐Hb linkage that forms during SDS‐mediated cell lysis. Formation of this linkage is lowest when ferrous Hb is oxidised, in the form of ferric metHb. Daily haemoglobin oxidation rhythms are observed in mouse and human RBCs cultured in vitro , or taken from humans in vivo , and are unaffected by mutations that affect circadian rhythms in nucleated cells. These rhythms correlate with daily rhythms in core body temperature, with temperature lowest when metHb levels are highest. Raising metHb levels with dietary sodium nitrite can further decrease daytime core body temperature in mice via nitric oxide (NO) signalling. These results extend our molecular understanding of RBC circadian rhythms and suggest they contribute to the regulation of body temperature.<sep>Between 6–20% of the cellular proteome is under circadian control and tunes mammalian cell function with daily environmental cycles. For cell viability, and to maintain volume within narrow limits, the daily variation in osmotic potential exerted by changes in the soluble proteome must be counterbalanced. The mechanisms and consequences of this osmotic compensation have not been investigated before. In cultured cells and in tissue we find that compensation involves electroneutral active transport of Na+, K+, and Cl− through differential activity of SLC12A family cotransporters. In cardiomyocytes ex vivo and in vivo, compensatory ion fluxes confer daily variation in electrical activity. Perturbation of soluble protein abundance has commensurate effects on ion composition and cellular function across the circadian cycle. Thus, circadian regulation of the proteome impacts ion homeostasis with substantial consequences for the physiology of electrically active cells such as cardiomyocytes. Osmotic compensation by electroneutral ion transport buffers TORC1-mediated changes in the cytosolic proteome, and maintains intracellular homeostasis and cell volume over the circadian cycle. Here, the authors find such ion content changes drive daily rhythms in cardiomyocyte electrical activity.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Granzyme B<sep>Ex vivo<sep>Adenocarcinoma<sep>Irreversible electroporation<sep>Differential diagnosis<sep>Meta-analysis<sep>Cancer<sep>Asymptomatic<sep>Stage (stratigraphy)<sep>Gastric bypass<sep>Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio<sep>Roux-en-Y anastomosis<sep>Electroporation<sep>Pancreas<sep>Stomach<sep>Perineural invasion<sep>Neuroendocrine tumors<sep>Population<sep>Retrospective cohort study<sep>Interleukin-7 receptor<sep>Gastrointestinal cancer<sep>Rectum<sep>Pulmonary embolism<sep>Electrochemotherapy<sep>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor<sep>Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes<sep>Resection<sep>Narrative review<sep>CD8<sep>Colorectal cancer<sep>Systematic review<sep>Accessory spleen<sep>Lymph node<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Radiation therapy<sep>Hepatectomy<sep>Gene<sep>Surgical oncology</keyword><title>Intrapancreatic accessory spleen false positive to 68Ga-Dotatoc: case report and literature review<sep>Pulsed Electric Fields in Oncology: A Snapshot of Current Clinical Practices and Research Directions from the 4th World Congress of Electroporation<sep>Gastric Cancer After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Case Report and a Systematic Review<sep>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) after open hepatectomy compared to minimally invasive liver resection: a systematic review and meta-analysis<sep>A rare case of metachronous neuroendocrine tumor after a colorectal adenocarcinoma: qualitative critical review of synchronous and metachronous gastrointestinal NET<sep>Genetically driven <scp>CD39</scp> expression shapes human tumor‐infiltrating <scp>CD8</scp><sup>+</sup> T‐cell functions<sep>Short course radiotherapy and delayed surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer in frail patients: is it a valid option?<sep>It is the lymph node ratio that determines survival and recurrence patterns in resected distal cholangiocarcinoma.

Differential diagnosis with pancreatic tumor, especially with non-functional neuroendocrine tumor (NF-NET), may be very hard and sometimes it entails unnecessary surgery. A combination of CT scan, MRI, and nuclear medicine can confirm the diagnosis of IPAS. 68-Ga-Dotatoc PET/CT is the gold standard in NET diagnosis and it can allow to distinguish between IPAS and NET. A 69-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for an incidental nodule in the tail of the pancreas with focal uptake of 68-Ga-dotatate at PET/CT. NET was suspected and open distal splenopancreatectomy was performed. Pathologic examination revealed an IPAS. This is the second IPAS case in which a positive 68Ga-Dotatoc uptake led to a false diagnosis of pancreatic NET. Here is a proposal of a literature review.<sep>The 4th World Congress of Electroporation (Copenhagen, 9-13 October 2022) provided a unique opportunity to convene leading experts in pulsed electric fields (PEF). PEF-based therapies harness electric fields to produce therapeutically useful effects on cancers and represent a valuable option for a variety of patients. As such, irreversible electroporation (IRE), gene electrotransfer (GET), electrochemotherapy (ECT), calcium electroporation (Ca-EP), and tumour-treating fields (TTF) are on the rise. Still, their full therapeutic potential remains underappreciated, and the field faces fragmentation, as shown by parallel maturation and differences in the stages of development and regulatory approval worldwide. This narrative review provides a glimpse of PEF-based techniques, including key mechanisms, clinical indications, and advances in therapy; finally, it offers insights into current research directions. By highlighting a common ground, the authors aim to break silos, strengthen cross-functional collaboration, and pave the way to novel possibilities for intervention. Intriguingly, beyond their peculiar mechanism of action, PEF-based therapies share technical interconnections and multifaceted biological effects (e.g., vascular, immunological) worth exploiting in combinatorial strategies.<sep>Background: Gastric carcinoma in the bypassed stomach after Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is rare, a few cases have been reported since 1991. The symptomatology associated is non-specific and the monitoring of a bypassed stomach is difficult. Case presentation: We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with an early cancer in the bypassed stomach 1 year after bariatric surgery. Method: PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE databases were revised. Result: up to date, 17 case reports are founded in literature, among theme 15 revealed gastric carcinoma, 1 GIST and 1 lymphoma. In our study were included 18 patients with gastric carcinoma. The interval between bypass surgery and the diagnosis of cancer ranged from 1 to 22 years. Mean patient age was 53.1 years (range: 38-71 years). The most frequent symptom was vague abdominal pain (50%), while only in one case was asymptomatic. In 7 patients (38,9%) the tumor was unresectable. Conclusion: Gastric carcinoma in the bypassed stomach after RYGB is rare and it is difficult to diagnose, and often disease’s stage is advanced by the time of diagnosis. The associated symptomalogy is non-specific, and so, it’s important to maintain a high clinical suspicion to diagnose it early.<sep>Even though the risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) after liver resection is well recognized, the association between surgical approach and VTE risk is unknown. This study aims to compare VTE rates following open liver resection (OLR) and minimally invasive liver resection (MILR).MEDLINE, Web Of Sciences and EMBASE databases were interrogated to identify eligible studies published between February 2016 and August 2022. Studies were considered suitable if they reported a comparison between OLR and MILR (including laparoscopic liver resection [LLR] or robotic liver resection [RLR]).Fourteen studies including 11 356 patients met the inclusion criteria. 5622 patients underwent OLR and 5734 patients underwent MILR. The VTE rate was higher among patients who underwent OLR compared to MILR (2.8% vs 1.4%, OR (95% CI) = 1.84, p=<00001). Similarly, the subgroup analysis showed a higher rate of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (1.4% vs 0.7%, OR (95% CI) = 1.98, p = 0.02) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (1.3% vs 0.7%, OR (95% CI) = 1.88, p = 0.002) in patients who underwent OLR compared to MILR.Patients who undergo open hepatectomy have a higher incidence of postoperative VTE when compared to those undergoing minimally invasive liver resection. This finding was consistent for both DVT and PE.<sep>Abstract Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) associated with a metachronous intestinal adenocarcinoma is rare. We report the case of a 71-year-old man with an ileal NET. Patient has previously undergone a left colectomy for sigmoid cancer. We report a complete review both of the metachronous and synchronous NET. A comprehensive systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE identified a total of 35 relevant studies. This study includes an analysis of review articles, case reports, case series, retrospective studies and population-based studies. In the English literature to date, there are 21 case reports (19 synchronous cases and 2 metachronous cases), 3 case series and 3 review articles, and less than 10 retrospective studies or population-based studies. A total of 31 patients in 24 articles were included in the study: 28 patients with a synchronous gastrointestinal NET and colorectal adenocarcinoma and 3 patients with metachronous gastrointestinal NET and colorectal adenocarcinoma. The incidence of synchronous cancer (particularly for colorectal and gastric cancer) with a gastrointestinal NET ranges from 10 to 50%, while for the metachronous ones it is still unclear. This is the third metachronous case report and the first descriptive case of gastrointestinal NET diagnosed 2 years after a colorectal adenocarcinoma. An endoscopic follow-up program for gastrointestinal NET patients and/or for first-degree relatives of NET patients appears recommendable.<sep>In our study, we investigated the role of CD39 on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ TILs) in colorectal, head and neck and pancreatic cancers. Partially confirming recent observations correlating the CD39 expression with T-cell exhaustion, we demonstrated a divergent functional activity in CD39+ CD8+ TILs. On the one hand, CD39+ CD8+ TILs (as compared to their CD39- counterparts) produced significantly lower IFN-γ and IL-2 amounts, expressed higher PD-1, and inversely correlated with perforin and granzyme B expression. On the other, they displayed a significantly higher proliferative capacity ex vivo that was inversely correlated with the PD-1 expression. Therefore, CD39+ CD8+ TILs, including those co-expressing the CD103 (a marker of T resident memory [TRM] cells), were defined as partially dysfunctional T cells that correlate with tumor patients with initial progression stages. Interestingly, our results identified for the first time a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs10748643 A>G), as a genetic factor associated with CD39 expression in CD8+ TILs. Finally, we demonstrated that compounds inhibiting CD39-related ATPases improved CD39+ CD8+ T-cell effector function ex vivo, and that CD39+ CD8+ TILs displayed effective suppression function in vitro. Overall these data suggest that the SNP analysis may represent a suitable predictor of CD39+ CD8+ T-cell expression in cancer patients, and propose the modulation of CD39 as a new strategy to restore partially exhausted CD8+ TILs.<sep>The endpoint of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) and SCRT with delayed surgery (SCRT-DS) on a selected subgroup of frail patients with locally advanced middle/low rectal adenocarcinoma.From January 2008 to December 2018, a total of 128 frail patients with locally advanced middle-low rectal adenocarcinoma underwent SCRT and subsequent restaging for eventual delayed surgery. Rates of complete pathological response, down-staging, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.128 patients completed 5 × 5 Gy pelvic radiotherapy. 69 of these were unfit for surgery; 59 underwent surgery 8 weeks (average time: 61 days) after radiotherapy. Downstaging of T occurred in 64% and down-staging of N in 50%. The median overall survival (OS) of SCRT alone was 19.5 months. The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year OS was 48%, 22%, 14% and 0% respectively. In the surgical group, the median disease-free survival (DFS) and median OS were, respectively, 67 months (95% CI 49.8-83.1 months) and 72.1 months (95% CI 57.5-86.7 months). The 1, 2, 3, 5-year OS was 88%, 75%, 51%, 46%, respectively. Post-operative morbidity was 22%, mortality was 3.4%.Frail patients with advanced rectal cancer are often \"unfit\" for long-term neoadjuvant chemoradiation. A SCRT may be considered a valid option for this group of patients. Once radiotherapy is completed, patients can be re-evaluated for surgery. If feasible, SCRT and delayed surgery is the best option for frail patients.<sep>Distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCC) is still associated with a poor overall survival (OS). This study aims to investigate the impact of novel prognostic scores in comparison with more traditional ones.Multicentric retrospective analysis of patients who underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for dCC. An unadjusted analysis was used to identify predictors of decreased survival. Significant variables were introduced in a multivariable model that assessed OS, recurrence-free survival (RFS), early recurrence (defined as a recurrence within the first 12 months from the PD), local and distant recurrence. Prognostic scores evaluated included the TNM staging system, the lymph-node ratio (LNR), the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the systemic inflammation index (SII).The study included 232 patients with resected dCC. The optimal cut-off value for LNR was 15% (LNR15). On the unadjusted analysis T stage (p = 0.012), N stage (p < 0.001), LNR15 (p < 0.001), grade (p < 0.001), perineural invasion (p < 0.001) and the R1 status of resection margin (p = 0.001) accounted for the decreased OS. No significant association between survival and PLR, NLR and SII were found. On the multivariable analysis only LNR15, perineural invasion and R1 were independent predictors of decreased RFS (p = 0.003, p = 0.021 and p = 0.009, respectively) and OS (p = 0.001, p = 0.016 and p = 0.013, respectively). Additionally, LNR15 was an independent predictor of early recurrence (p = 0.003) and both LNR15 and R1 were associated with increased local (p < 0.001 and p = 0.010) and distant recurrence (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003).LNR15 is an independent predictor of DFS, OS, early, local and distal recurrence, combined with the status of the resection margin and perineural invasion.<sep>Background: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a non-thermal form of ablation based on the delivery of pulsed electrical fields. It has been used to treat liver lesions, particularly those in proximity to major hepatic vasculature. The role of this technique in the portfolio of treatments for colorectal hepatic metastases has not been clearly defined. This study undertakes a systematic review of IRE for treatment of colorectal hepatic metastases. Methods: The study protocol was registered with the PROSPERO register of systematic reviews (CRD42022332866) and reports in compliance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). The Ovid MEDLINE®, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were queried in April 2022. The search terms ‘irreversible electroporation’, ‘colon cancer’, ‘rectum cancer’ and ‘liver metastases’ were used in combinations. Studies were included if they provided information on the use of IRE for patients with colorectal hepatic metastases and reported procedure and disease-specific outcomes. The searches returned 647 unique articles and the exclusions left a total of eight articles. These were assessed for bias using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS criteria) and reported using the synthesis without meta-analysis guideline (SWiM). Results: One hundred eighty patients underwent treatment for liver metastases from colorectal cancer. The median transverse diameter of tumours treated by IRE was &lt;3 cm. Ninety-four (52%) tumours were adjacent to major hepatic inflow/outflow structures or the vena cava. IRE was undertaken under general anaesthesia with cardiac cycle synchronisation and with the use of either CT or ultrasound for lesion localisation. Probe spacing was less than 3.2 cm for all ablations. There were two (1.1%) procedure-related deaths in 180 patients. There was one (0.5%) post-operative haemorrhage requiring laparotomy, one (0.5%) bile leak, five (2.8%) post-procedure biliary strictures and a zero incidence of post-IRE liver failure. Conclusions: This systematic review shows that IRE for colorectal liver metastases can be accomplished with low procedure-related morbidity and mortality. Further prospective study is required to assess the role of IRE in the portfolio of treatments for patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/106155/national-insitute-of-health-research-clinical-lectureship/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5068481164", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5041365850", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on circadian rhythms, cardiac physiology, and metabolic regulation, which aligns closely with the clinical specialties listed in the job description, such as Cardiology, Neurology, and Respiratory Medicine.

At the beginning, the scope of application of the robustness concept was analysed, based on scientific and industry literature. Then the attention was focused on the model of the rail transport system and the schedule, the basic indicator of robustness assessment was discussed, taking into account the methods of analysis used and many variables occurring in rail transport. Finally, a review of the state of knowledge is summarised and the most important observations from the analysis are indicated. In the case of a robust schedule there is no propagation of disruption across the network after an adverse event has occurred.<sep>Abstract The evaluation of team work schedules in complex rail transport conditions is related to the robustness of individual solutions. In rail systems there are many aims that are important for users. One of the most important aims is to find a feasible solution. It is characterized by the non-conflicting schedule with another train, minimizing the travel time of the trainset and taking into account the priority of train. The problem of responding to delays in terms of reorganisation of work, prevention of delay propagation and real-time schedule changes is important. Schedules are built in a way that ensures the best use of work time. This has a negative impact on critical situations. The study analysed the changes of the conductor’s team to another train depending on the buffer time provided in work plan, real time needed for change and train delays.<sep>In the paper, the problem of determining the crew efficiency indicator was analysed. The limits of the coefficient value were checked. In terms of the theoretical values the Wroclaw City case was studied. Differences between theoretical and empirical values were identified. Their genesis was found and guidance for constructing the timetable was provided. The designers constantly take measures to increase the value of this coefficient, for example by operating several lines by one vehicle. Increasing the length of communication lines - despite making them more susceptible to traffic disruptions—increases the achievable value of the efficiency index, as the length of the course does not affect the time required to perform duties on the loop. The highest values of the indicator are obtained on working days, when the planned transport is the highest. As the number of vehicle kilometres per day decreases, it becomes more difficult to achieve rational index values.<sep>Virtual reality (VR) is widely used in transportation systems. In railway, VR is used as an element supporting the personnel training process. The results presented in the article result from work under the project “Innovative training system for tram drivers based on a full-cabin simulator with the use of cognitive science,” funded by the National Center for Research and Development. The first stage of this project's work was identifying all potential adverse events. Authors aim to present the results of the analysis and risk assessment of adverse events, which will form the basis for developing training scenarios for tram drivers. The activities undertaken in the article included the preparation of a risk matrix in two dimensions – the probability and consequences of an adverse event. The results showed that most of the identified events belong to the group of catastrophic and unacceptable risks. Therefore, they should be reflected as driver collocation scenarios.<sep>The traffic schedule is planned to keep distances between trains which allow a conflict-free train operation. For this reason the load of the power supply system is distributed in time. In consequence, the power limit is not exceeded. After unwanted event occurring, the traffic structure may change in such a way that an accumulation of section load can occur. As a result, the power limit can be exceeded and the electricity system may be damaged. Therefore, the main goal of the paper is to elaborate a method for railway timetable evaluation due to random power infrastructure load, caused by undesirable events. To reach the goal, a literature review was performed in terms of timetable evaluation, buffer times, undesirable events, system resilience and robustness. A method based on transportation mean movement theory with probability issues was proposed. The method was verified on a timetable for a selected railway line in Poland. Tractive calculations in terms of the electric power consumption were carried out. Using the method, critical situations were identified and changes were proposed. The paper ends with a discussion of the method and further research.<sep>The robustness of the timetable is a sensitive issue in the daily realization of railway operations. As shown in the paper, robustness is a function of time reserves that helps to prevent unscheduled stops resulting from traffic disruptions and causing a higher energy consumption. The correct handling of time reserves while scheduling is a multidimensional issue, and it has a significant influence on the energy consumption of railway traffic. Therefore, the paper aims to show a simulation-based method, taking into account failure occurring probabilities and their consequences to get an acceptable level of robustness, that can be quantified by the probability of no delay propagation. This paper presents a method for the addition of time margins to the railway timetable. The iterative time buffer adding method is based on operational data as a knowledge source, to achieve the punctuality target. It was verified on a real railway line. An analysis of energy consumption for unscheduled train stops depending on the added buffer time was conducted after the literature review and the presentation of the evaluation model. The paper ends with discussion of the results and conclusions.<sep>In training process of rail traffic manager (controller) using virtual reality technology, selection of activities among those assigned to a workplace and scenarios that should be taken in training is an important issue. The selection method that is based on performance variability of her/his activities has been proposed in the paper. This variability has been characterized by timing and precision. The traditional reliability and safety analysis methods are not sufficient when building the training program for traffic managers. In the paper the train controller work has been modelled using Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) that is system oriented approach. Scales of values of timing and precision that are train transport driven have been presented. They are different when comparing with typical timing and precision scales given in FRAM literature. In the paper the estimation of prob-abilities of occurring of values of timing and precision scales for these activities has been calculated as the mean from the values obtained by questionnaire done in traffic manager community or using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. In FRAM with AHP approaches presented in literature, AHP pairwise comparison is executed using natural numbers and their reciprocals what is typical in AHP method. In our paper the AHP is used for estimating the probabilities, so in pairwise comparing the rational numbers are applied, because natural numbers and their reciprocals would limit the set of values of probabilities. The activities and scenarios that the training should be concentrated on are selected from those with the greatest variability.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Hippocampus<sep>Cerebellum<sep>Astrocyte<sep>Bioenergetics<sep>Midbrain<sep>Autophagy<sep>Calcium<sep>Neurodegeneration<sep>NRF1<sep>KEAP1<sep>Glutamate receptor<sep>Brain development<sep>Neurotransmitter<sep>Rage (emotion)<sep>Mitochondrial DNA<sep>Cellular pathology<sep>Lipopolysaccharide<sep>Heat shock protein<sep>Glutathione<sep>Activator (genetics)<sep>Singlet oxygen<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Oxidative phosphorylation<sep>NMDA receptor<sep>Disease<sep>Lipid peroxidation<sep>Mitochondrial permeability transition pore<sep>Inner mitochondrial membrane<sep>Respiration<sep>Cancer<sep>Reactive oxygen species<sep>Hypoxanthine<sep>Cytosol<sep>Extracellular<sep>Förster resonance energy transfer<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Protein folding<sep>Enzyme<sep>Crosstalk<sep>Intracellular<sep>Oxidative stress<sep>Enos<sep>Autofluorescence<sep>Stimulation<sep>Hypoxia (environmental)<sep>In vivo<sep>Mitophagy<sep>Receptor<sep>NADPH oxidase<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Metabolism<sep>ATP synthase<sep>Nitric oxide<sep>Agonist<sep>Mesenchymal stem cell<sep>Electron Transport Complex I<sep>Energy metabolism<sep>AMPA receptor<sep>DNAJA3<sep>Monoamine oxidase<sep>Calcium signaling<sep>Excitotoxicity<sep>Programmed cell death<sep>Cancer cell<sep>Huntingtin<sep>Neuroprotection<sep>Long-term depression<sep>Mechanism (biology)<sep>Epinephrine<sep>Cardiolipin<sep>Mitochondrial disease<sep>Neurotoxicity<sep>Polyphosphate<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Axotomy<sep>Dopamine<sep>Flavin group<sep>Flavin adenine dinucleotide<sep>Uniporter<sep>T-type calcium channel</keyword><title>The brain—from neurodevelopment to neurodegeneration<sep>Inorganic polyphosphate is produced and hydrolyzed in F0F1-ATP synthase of mammalian mitochondria<sep>Singlet oxygen stimulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in brain cells<sep>Mitochondrial dysfunction and energy deprivation in the mechanism of neurodegeneration<sep>Nrf2 activation reprograms macrophage intermediary metabolism and suppresses the type I interferon response<sep>Astrocytes produce nitric oxide via nitrite reduction in mitochondria to regulate cerebral blood flow during brain hypoxia<sep>Dopamine controls neuronal spontaneous calcium oscillations via astrocytic signal<sep>Cellular mechanisms of complex I-associated pathology<sep>High levels of FAD autofluorescence indicate pathology preceding cell death<sep>Interaction of Oxidative Stress and Misfolded Proteins in the Mechanism of Neurodegeneration<sep>Mitochondria and lipid peroxidation in the mechanism of neurodegeneration: Finding ways for prevention<sep>The Role of p53 Protein in the Realization of the Exogenous Heat Shock Protein 70 Anti-Apoptotic Effect during Axotomy<sep>Age‐related changes in the energy of human mesenchymal stem cells<sep>Structural conversion of α-synuclein at the mitochondria induces neuronal toxicity<sep>Pathological structural conversion of α-synuclein at the mitochondria induces neuronal toxicity<sep>HPRT1 Deficiency Induces Alteration of Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism in the Brain<sep>Interaction of Mitochondrial Calcium and ROS in Neurodegeneration<sep>Mitochondrial Calcium Deregulation in the Mechanism of Beta-Amyloid and Tau Pathology<sep>Lactate and Pyruvate Activate Autophagy and Mitophagy that Protect Cells in Toxic Model of Parkinson’s Disease<sep>Detection of <scp>NADH</scp> and <scp>NADPH</scp> levels <i>in vivo</i> identifies shift of glucose metabolism in cancer to energy production<sep>Metabolically induced intracellular pH changes activate mitophagy, autophagy, and cell protection in familial forms of Parkinson's disease<sep>Adrenaline induces calcium signal in astrocytes and vasoconstriction via activation of monoamine oxidase<sep><scp>RAGE</scp> induces physiological activation of <scp>NADPH</scp> oxidase in neurons and astrocytes and neuroprotection<sep>Variability of mitochondrial energy balance across brain regions<sep>Insoluble tau aggregates induce neuronal death through modification of membrane ion conductance, activation of voltage‐gated calcium channels and NADPH oxidase<sep>Pharmacological sequestration of mitochondrial calcium uptake protects against dementia and β-amyloid neurotoxicity<sep>Role of DJ-1 in the mechanism of pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease<sep>Inorganic Polyphosphate Regulates AMPA and NMDA Receptors and Protects Against Glutamate Excitotoxicity via Activation of P2Y Receptors</title><abstract>The brain is the organ that orchestrates the whole body. To do so, neurons and glia in different brain regions have evolved to be highly specialized and are regulated by diverse receptors and neuro- and gliotransmitters. Some of the features of the brain, including a protective brain-blood barrier, high-energy demand, and electrical activity, mean that neurons and astrocytes are uniquely diverse components of tissue that vary greatly even across brain regions. This Special Issue features 19 review articles that cover different aspects of the broad field of neuroscience-from neurodevelopment, physiology and memory formation to the mechanisms underlying the development of neurodegenerative diseases.<sep>Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is a polymer present in all living organisms. Although polyP is found to be involved in a variety of functions in cells of higher organisms, the enzyme responsible for polyP production and consumption has not yet been identified. Here, we studied the effect of polyP on mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation and activity of F0F1-ATPsynthase. We have found that polyP activates mitochondrial respiration which does not coupled with ATP production (V2) but inhibits ADP-dependent respiration (V3). Moreover, PolyP can stimulate F0F1-ATPase activity in the presence of ATP and, importantly, can be hydrolyzed in this enzyme instead of ATP. Furthermore, PolyP can be produced in mitochondria in the presence of substrates for respiration and phosphate by the F0F1-ATPsynthase. Thus, polyP is an energy molecule in mammalian cells which can<sep>Oxygen, in form of reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been shown to participate in oxidative stress, one of the major triggers for pathology, but also is a main contributor to physiological processes. Recently, it was found that 1267 nm irradiation can produce singlet oxygen without photosensitizers. We used this phenomenon to study the effect of laser-generated singlet oxygen on one of the major oxygen-dependent processes, mitochondrial energy metabolism. We have found that laser-induced generation of 1O2 in neurons and astrocytes led to the increase of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of NADH- and FADH-dependent respiration, and importantly, increased the rate of maximal respiration in isolated mitochondria. The activation of mitochondrial respiration stimulated production of ATP in these cells. Thus, we found that the singlet oxygen generated by 1267 nm laser pulse<sep>Abstract Energy-producing organelles mitochondria are involved in a number of cellular functions. Deregulation of mitochondrial function due to mutations or effects of mitochondrial toxins is proven to be a trigger for diverse pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders. Despite the extensive research done in the last decades, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction leads to neuronal deregulation and cell death have not yet been fully elucidated. Brain cells are specifically dependent on mitochondria due to their high energy demands to maintain neuronal ion gradients and signal transduction, and also, to mediate neuronal health through the processes of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, mitophagy, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial dynamics. Some of these processes have been independently implicated in the mechanism of neuronal loss in neurodegeneration. Moreover, it is increasingly recognised that these<sep>To overcome oxidative, inflammatory, and metabolic stress, cells have evolved cytoprotective protein networks controlled by nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its negative regulator, Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1). Here, using high-resolution mass spectrometry we characterize the proteomes of macrophages with altered Nrf2 status revealing significant differences among the genotypes in metabolism and redox homeostasis, which were validated with respirometry and metabolomics. Nrf2 affected the proteome following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, with alterations in redox, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and innate immunity. Notably, Nrf2 activation promoted mitochondrial fusion. The Keap1 inhibitor, 4-octyl itaconate remodeled the inflammatory macrophage proteome, increasing redox and suppressing type I interferon (IFN) response. Similarly, pharmacologic or genetic Nrf2 activation inhibited the transcription of IFN-β and its downstream effector IFIT2 during LPS stimulation. These data<sep>During hypoxia, increases in cerebral blood flow maintain brain oxygen delivery. Here, we describe a mechanism of brain oxygen sensing that mediates the dilation of intraparenchymal cerebral blood vessels in response to reductions in oxygen supply. In vitro and in vivo experiments conducted in rodent models show that during hypoxia, cortical astrocytes produce the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) via nitrite reduction in mitochondria. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration mimics, but also occludes, the effect of hypoxia on NO production in astrocytes. Astrocytes display high expression of the molybdenum-cofactor-containing mitochondrial enzyme sulfite oxidase, which can catalyze nitrite reduction in hypoxia. Replacement of molybdenum with tungsten or knockdown of sulfite oxidase expression in astrocytes blocks hypoxia-induced NO production by these glial cells and reduces the cerebrovascular response to hypoxia. These data identify<sep>Dopamine is a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter responsible for a number of physiological processes. Dysfunctions of the dopamine metabolism and signalling are associated with neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here we report that in primary co-culture of neurons and astrocytes dopamine-induces calcium signal in astrocytes and suppress spontaneous synchronous calcium oscillations (SSCO) in neurons. Effect of dopamine on SSCO in neurons was dependent on calcium signal in astrocytes and could be modified by inhibition of dopamine-induced calcium signal or by stimulation of astrocytic calcium rise with ATP. Ability of dopamine to suppress SSCO in neurons was independent on D1- or D2- like receptors but dependent on GABA and alpha-adrenoreceptors. Inhibitor of monoaminoxidase bifemelane blocked effect of dopamine on astrocytes but also inhibited the effect dopamine on SSCO in neurons. These findings suggest<sep>Mitochondria control vitally important functions in cells, including energy production, cell signalling and regulation of cell death. Considering this, any alteration in mitochondrial metabolism would lead to cellular dysfunction and the development of a disease. A large proportion of disorders associated with mitochondria are induced by mutations or chemical inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I - the entry point to the electron transport chain. Subunits of the enzyme NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and mutations in these genes lead to cardio and muscular pathologies and diseases of the central nervous system. Despite such a clear involvement of complex I deficiency in numerous disorders, the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to the development of pathology are not very clear. In this review, we summarise how<sep>Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) autofluorescence from cells reports on the enzymatic activity which involves FAD as a cofactor. Most of the cellular FAD fluorescence comes from complex II of the electron transport chain in mitochondria and can be assessed with inhibitor analysis. The intensity of FAD autofluorescence is not homogeneous and vary between cells in tissue and in cell culture types. Using primary co-culture of neurons and astrocytes, and human skin fibroblasts we have found that very high FAD autofluorescence is a result of an overactivation of the mitochondrial complex II from ETC and from the activity of monoamine oxidases. Cells with high FAD autofluorescence were mostly intact and were not co-labelled with indicators for necrosis or apoptosis. However, cells with high FAD fluorescence showed activation of apoptosis and necrosis<sep>Aggregation of the misfolded proteins β-amyloid, tau, huntingtin, and α-synuclein is one of the most important steps in the pathology underlying a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, including the two most common ones-Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Activity and toxicity of these proteins depends on the stage and form of aggregates. Excessive production of free radicals, including reactive oxygen species which lead to oxidative stress, is proven to be involved in the mechanism of pathology in most of neurodegenerative disorders. Both reactive oxygen species and misfolded proteins play a physiological role in the brain, and only deregulation in redox state and aggregation of the proteins leads to pathology. Here, we review the role of misfolded proteins in the activation of ROS production from various sources in neurons and glia. We discuss<sep>The world's population aging progression renders age-related neurodegenerative diseases to be one of the biggest unsolved problems of modern society. Despite the progress in studying the development of pathology, finding ways for modifying neurodegenerative disorders remains a high priority. One common feature of neurodegenerative diseases is mitochondrial dysfunction and overproduction of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress. Although lipid peroxidation is one of the markers for oxidative stress, it also plays an important role in cell physiology, including activation of phospholipases and stimulation of signaling cascades. Excessive lipid peroxidation is a hallmark for most neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and many other neurological conditions. The products of lipid peroxidation have been shown to be the trigger for necrotic, apoptotic, and more specifically for oxidative<sep>The search for effective neuroprotective agents for the treatment of neurotrauma has always been of great interest to researchers around the world. Extracellular heat shock protein 70 (eHsp70) is considered a promising agent to study, as it has been demonstrated to exert a significant neuroprotective activity against various neurodegenerative diseases. We showed that eHsp70 can penetrate neurons and glial cells when added to the incubation medium, and can accumulate in the nuclei of neurons and satellite glial cells after axotomy. eHsp70 reduces apoptosis and necrosis of the glial cells, but not the neurons. At the same time, co-localization of eHsp70 with p53 protein, one of the key regulators of apoptosis, was noted. eHsp70 reduces the level of the p53 protein apoptosis promoter both in glial cells and in the nuclei<sep>Aging is a physiological process that leads to a higher risk for the most devastating diseases. There are a number of theories of human aging proposed, and many of them are directly or indirectly linked to mitochondria. Here, we used mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from young and older donors to study age-related changes in mitochondrial metabolism. We have found that aging in MSCs is associated with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and lower NADH levels in mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA content is higher in aged MSCs, but the overall mitochondrial mass is decreased due to increased rates of mitophagy. Despite the higher level of ATP in aged cells, a higher rate of ATP consumption renders them more vulnerable to energy deprivation compared to younger cells. Changes in mitochondrial metabolism in<sep>Abstract Aggregation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) drives Parkinson’s disease, although the initial stages of self-assembly and structural conversion have not been captured inside neurons. We track the intracellular conformational states of α-Syn utilizing a single-molecule FRET biosensor, and show that α-Syn converts from its monomeric state to form two distinct oligomeric states in neurons in a concentration dependent, and sequence specific manner. 3D FRET-CLEM reveals the structural organization, and location of aggregation hotspots inside the cell. Notably multiple intracellular seeding events occur preferentially on membrane surfaces, especially mitochondrial membranes.

In this study, we tracked the intracellular conformational states of α-Syn using a single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) biosensor, and we show here that α-Syn converts from a monomeric state into two distinct oligomeric states in neurons in a concentration-dependent and sequence-specific manner. Three-dimensional FRET-correlative light and electron microscopy (FRET-CLEM) revealed that intracellular seeding events occur preferentially on membrane surfaces, especially at mitochondrial membranes. The mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin triggers rapid oligomerization of A53T α-Syn, and cardiolipin is sequestered within aggregating lipid–protein complexes. Mitochondrial aggregates impair complex I activity and increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which accelerates the oligomerization of A53T α-Syn and<sep>Alterations in function of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), one of the major enzymes involved in purine nucleotide exchange, lead to overproduction of uric acid and produce various symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS). One of the hallmarks of LNS is maximal expression of HPRT in the central nervous system with the highest activity of this enzyme in the midbrain and basal ganglia. However, the nature of neurological symptoms has yet to be clarified in details. Here, we studied whether HPRT1 deficiency changes mitochondrial energy metabolism and redox balance in murine neurons from the cortex and midbrain. We found that HPRT1 deficiency inhibits complex I-dependent mitochondrial respiration resulting in increased levels of mitochondrial NADH, reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria<sep>Neurodegenerative disorders are currently incurable devastating diseases which are characterized by the slow and progressive loss of neurons in specific brain regions. Progress in the investigation of the mechanisms of these disorders helped to identify a number of genes associated with familial forms of these diseases and a number of toxins and risk factors which trigger sporadic and toxic forms of these diseases. Recently, some similarities in the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases were identified, including the involvement of mitochondria, oxidative stress, and the abnormality of Ca2+ signaling in neurons and astrocytes. Thus, mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species during metabolism which play a further role in redox signaling, but this may also act as an additional trigger for abnormal mitochondrial calcium handling, resulting in mitochondrial calcium overload. Combinations of these factors<sep>Aggregation and deposition of β-amyloid and/or tau protein are the key neuropathological features in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies including frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The interaction between oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and the impairment of calcium ions (Ca2+) homeostasis induced by misfolded tau and β-amyloid plays an important role in the progressive neuronal loss occurring in specific areas of the brain. In addition to the control of bioenergetics and ROS production, mitochondria are fine regulators of the cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis that induce vital signalling mechanisms in excitable cells such as neurons. Impairment in the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) or release through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger may lead to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and opening of the permeability transition pore inducing neuronal death. Recent<sep>Intracellular quality control regulated by autophagy process is important for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Deregulation of autophagy and more specifically mitophagy leads to accumulation of the misfolded proteins and damaged mitochondria that in turn leads to the cell loss. Alteration of autophagy and mitophagy has shown to be involved in the number of disorders including neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy and mitophagy could be activated by short-time acidification of the cytosol; however, most of the compounds which can induce it are toxic. Here, we tested several organic compounds which are involved in cellular metabolism on their ability to change intracellular pH and induce mitophagy/autophagy. We have found that lactate and pyruvate are able to reduce intracellular pH in non-toxic concentrations. Short-term (2 h) and long-term (24 h) incubation of the cells with<sep>Profound changes in the metabolism of cancer cells have been known for almost 100 years, and many aspects of these changes have continued to be actively studied and discussed. Differences in the results of various studies can be explained by the diversity of tumours, which have differing processes of energy metabolism, and by limitations in the methods used. Here, using fluorescence lifetime needle optical biopsy in a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model and patients with HCC, we measured reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in control liver, and in HCC tumours and their adjacent regions. We found that NADH level (mostly responsible for energy metabolism) is increased in tumours but also in adjacent regions of the same liver. NADPH level is significantly decreased in<sep>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder induced by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in midbrain. The mechanism of neurodegeneration is associated with aggregation of misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Considering this, the process of removal of unwanted organelles or proteins by autophagy is vitally important in neurons, and activation of these processes could be protective in PD. Short-time acidification of the cytosol can activate mitophagy and autophagy. Here, we used sodium pyruvate and sodium lactate to induce changes in intracellular pH in human fibroblasts with PD mutations (Pink1, Pink1/Park2, α-synuclein triplication, A53T). We have found that both lactate and pyruvate in millimolar concentrations can induce a short-time acidification of the cytosol in these cells. This induced activation of mitophagy and autophagy in control and PD fibroblasts<sep>Adrenaline or epinephrine is a hormone playing an important role in physiology. It is produced de-novo in the brain in very small amounts compared to other catecholamines, including noradrenaline. Although the effects of adrenaline on neurons have been extensively studied, much less is known about the action of this hormone on astrocytes. Here, we studied the effects of adrenaline on astrocytes in primary co-culture of neurons and astrocytes. Application of adrenaline induced calcium signal in both neurons and astrocytes, but only in neurons this effect was dependent on α- and β-receptor antagonists. The effects of adrenaline on astrocytes were less dependent on adrenoreceptors: the antagonist carvedilol had only moderate effect on the calcium signal and the agonist of adrenoreceptors methoxamine induced a signal only in small proportion of the cells.<sep>The transmembrane receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a signaling receptor for many damage‐ and pathogen‐associated molecules. Activation of RAGE is associated with inflammation and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Although several sources of ROS have been previously suggested, how RAGE induces ROS production is still unclear, considering the multiple targets of pathogen‐associated molecules. Here, using acute brain slices and primary co‐culture of cortical neurons and astrocytes, we investigated the effects of a range of synthetic peptides corresponding to the fragments of the RAGE V‐domain on redox signaling. We found that the synthetic fragment (60–76) of the RAGE V‐domain induces activation of ROS production in astrocytes and neurons from the primary co‐culture and acute brain slices. This effect occurred through activation of RAGE and could<sep>Abstract Brain is not homogenous and neurons from various brain regions are known to have different vulnerabilities to mitochondrial mutations and mitochondrial toxins. However, it is not clear if this vulnerability is connected to different energy metabolism in specific brain regions. Here, using live‐cell imaging, we compared mitochondrial membrane potential and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) redox balance in acute rat brain slices in different brain regions and further detailed the mitochondrial metabolism in primary neurons and astrocytes from rat cortex, midbrain and cerebellum. We have found that mitochondrial membrane potential is higher in brain slices from the hippocampus and brain stem. In primary co‐cultures, mitochondrial membrane potential in astrocytes was lower than in neurons, whereas in midbrain cells it was higher than in cortex and cerebellum. The rate of NADH<sep>Most neurodegenerative disorders are associated with aggregation and accumulation of misfolded proteins. One of these proteins, tau, is involved in a number of pathologies including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Aggregation and phosphorylation of tau have been shown to be a trigger for abnormal signal transduction and disruption of cellular homeostasis. Here, we have studied the effect of extracellular tau at different stages of aggregation in cortical co‐cultures of neurons and astrocytes, to understand how this process affects tau pathogenicity. We found that the species formed after prolonged in vitro aggregation of tau (longer than 1 day) are able to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through the activation of NADPH oxidase without decreasing the level of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione. The same late insoluble aggregates of tau induced calcium<sep>All forms of dementia including Alzheimer's disease are currently incurable. Mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium alterations are shown to be involved in the mechanism of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Previously we have described the ability of compound Tg-2112x to protect neurons via sequestration of mitochondrial calcium uptake and we suggest that it can also be protective against neurodegeneration and development of dementia. Using primary co-culture neurons and astrocytes we studied the effect of Tg-2112x and its derivative Tg-2113x on β-amyloid-induced changes in calcium signal, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial calcium, and cell death. We have found that both compounds had no effect on β-amyloid or acetylcholine-induced calcium changes in the cytosol although Tg2113x, but not Tg2112x reduced glutamate-induced calcium signal. Both compounds were able to reduce mitochondrial calcium uptake and protected cells<sep>DJ-1 protein has multiple specific mechanisms to protect dopaminergic neurons against neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Wild type DJ-1 can acts as oxidative stress sensor and as an antioxidant. DJ-1 exhibits the properties of molecular chaperone, protease, glyoxalase, transcriptional regulator that protects mitochondria from oxidative stress. DJ-1 increases the expression of two mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP 4 and UCP5), that decrease mitochondrial membrane potential and leads to the suppression of ROS production, optimizes of a number of mitochondrial functions, and is regarded as protection for the neuronal cell survival. We discuss also the stabilizing interaction of DJ-1 with the mitochondrial Bcl-xL protein, which regulates the activity of (Inositol trisphosphate receptor) IP3R, prevents the cytochrome c release from mitochondria and inhibits the apoptosis activation. Upon oxidative stress DJ-1 is able to regulate<sep>Glutamate is one of the most important neurotransmitters in the process of signal transduction in the CNS. Excessive amounts of this neurotransmitter lead to glutamate excitotoxicity, which is accountable for neuronal death in acute neurological disorders, including stroke and trauma, and in neurodegenerative diseases. Inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) plays multiple roles in the mammalian brain, including function as a calcium-dependent gliotransmitter mediating communication between astrocytes, while its role in the regulation of neuronal activity is unknown. Here we studied the effect of PolyP on glutamate-induced calcium signal in primary rat neurons in both physiological and pathological conditions. We found that preincubation of primary neurons with PolyP reduced glutamate-induced and AMPA-induced but not the NMDA-induced calcium signal. However, in rat hippocampal acute slices, PolyP reduced ion flux through NMDA and AMPA receptors</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/12804204", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5036759361", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5055353781", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on rail transport and scheduling, which is unrelated to the molecular biology and virology requirements of the job, while Candidate B has extensive experience in molecular biology, neurobiology, and mitochondrial research, aligning closely with the project's focus on HIV-1 and molecular techniques.\nPreferred: B\nConfidence score: 100", "created": 1737539488, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 70, "prompt_tokens": 8628, "total_tokens": 8698, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 8564}, "comparison": "Candidate A's research focuses on rail transport and scheduling, which is unrelated to the molecular biology and virology requirements of the job, while Candidate B has extensive experience in molecular biology, neurobiology, and mitochondrial research, aligning closely with the project's focus on HIV-1 and molecular techniques.", "preferred": "B", "confidence_score": 100, "passage_rank1": 34, "passage_rank2": 41}

The progressive evolution of the piping process is described by expressing apparent diffusivity of the soil as a function of the local hydraulic gradient. In order to accurately compute local field gradients, a dual lattice approach that evaluates the response on both Delaunay and Voronoi nodes is formulated. The response computed at the Delaunay nodes is then employed to augment field gradient computation on the Voronoi grid. The proposed dual lattice model is numerically verified and validated by comparing numerical results with BEP experiments available in the literature.<sep>Pultruded Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs) are a class of novel composite materials with remarkable strength (comparable or even greater to that of steel) and resistance to environmental effects. However, the strongly orthotropic behavior of these materials and the relatively high deformability and spatial variability in mechanical properties bring challenges to the widespread adoption of these elements in structural applications. To this end, the orientation and distribution of the fibers are the most influential parameters that affect both the ultimate strength and stiffness of the specimens. This work presents an experimental campaign conducted on GFRP specimens in uniaxial tension and 3-point bending; coupon specimens with three different fibers orientations (namely 0, 45, and 90 degrees) were tested to characterize the ultimate strength and failure modes Results of such experimental campaign are first presented, and detailed statistical measures of the so-obtained strength values are presented with the ultimate goal of characterizing the variability in mechanical properties in commercially available profiles.<sep>This manuscript presents a recently developed automated robotic system for the deployment of block-based structures. The main structural component used for the construction of the specimens is the droxel: a universal building component recently developed by the authors. The herein presented work builds on such research to create new software and hardware capabilities to deploy droxel-based structures autonomously, by means of ground robotic operations. First, the paper describes the designed mechanical components and the experimental setup. Then, the main features of the ad-hoc designed software tools will be presented, together with the salient results of the experimental campaign. Different experiments on various types of structures (e.g., shelters and bridges) constructed by means of an ABB IRB120 robotic arm will be presented and quantification of the efficiency of the operations will be discussed. Quantitative description of the stability of the structures under construction, as well as capability of deploying full scale versions of different structural system is then discussed and conclusions and recommendations drawn.<sep>Over the last decades, pultruded glass fibre-reinforced polymers (GFRP) have emerged as a viable alternative to traditional materials for use in various structural applications. The remarkable strength-to-weight ratio and durability against environmental effects (such as corrosion) are, in fact, appealing properties that have the potential to allow for improved design of horizontal and vertical infrastructure. However, the relatively low stiffness and strength in the direction orthogonal to the fibres currently hampers the widespread adoption of GFRP structural elements for civil engineering applications. Even though a substantial amount of experimental work is available in literature, there still is a need for a better characterization of the effects of fibres orientation on mechanical properties of Pultruded GFRP elements. For this reason, the work presented herein investigates the mechanical behaviour of pultruded GFRP beams using analytical methods. First, experimental results from a small-scale campaign conducted by the authors will be presented. Such results will then be used to validate the analytical model and compare the results in terms of elastic stiffness vs. fibres orientation.<sep>Abstract This article presents a novel multiscale modeling approach to simulate the evolution of the backward erosion piping (BEP) process in flood protection systems (FPSs). A multiphase description of the BEP phenomenon is proposed for the numerical solution at the local scale and validated by means of full‐scale experimental results available in the literature. Results of the local scale simulations are used as the training set for a multilayer machine learning (ML) model to bridge the information between the local and system scales. Accuracy of the trained ML algorithms is demonstrated by comparing results obtained from detailed physics‐based numerical models. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in its capability of real‐time predictions of the overall response at the system scale. A case study is presented where a portion of the Nashville Metro Levee System is analyzed over the span of a year, to assess the likelihood of BEP in the infrastructure. The capability of the model to accept water height data obtained from field measurements is exploited in the numerical simulations.<sep>This manuscript presents the results of research conducted in the context of the assessment of Flood Protection Infrastructure (FPI) against the progressive evolution of internal damage caused by erosion mechanisms, with emphasis on Backward Erosion Piping (BEP) induced failures. A novel approach, encompassing both deterministic physics-based numerical simulations and probabilistic data-based techniques, is presented and validated through experimental data obtained at multiple length scales. The deterministic simulations are used to train a multilayer machine learning model that is capable of quantifying the state of the infrastructure in quasi-real-time and is inherently capable of accepting live data from embedded and remote sensors. The significant reduction in computational cost obtained through the adoption of ML techniques allows for the investigation of the hyperparameters space in an efficient fashion, allowing for meaningful sensitivity analyses and physics discovery. The results of a projected real-life case study are reported, where a selected FPI system is simulated at the system scale ( $$>10^5$$ m) over a period of one year, and conclusions are drawn on the capabilities of the proposed model.<sep>Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) are an attractive alternative to traditional construction materials, as a result of their strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance and electromagnetic transparency that can be exploited in design for specific structural applications. However, challenges also arise from the relatively low strength and stiffness in the direction orthogonal to the fibers. The increased deformability resulting from these actions can, in fact, result critical in the design of the elements and potentially cause premature failures under service and ultimate limit state conditions. To this end, numerical methods are an effective means for simulating the nonlinear behavior of GFRP elements and assess safety of structural assemblies. This work proposes a review of recent developments in the definition and validation of random lattice modeling approaches for the simulation of fracture in GFRP structural elements. Attention is devoted to the derivation of appropriate rules to scale the stiffness and strength of each lattice element in the network, to describe the transversally orthotropic behavior of the medium. The mathematical derivation of the relevant element-level matrices will be presented first. Results obtained from numerical simulations at different scales will be discussed, and open challenges and directions for future research presented.<sep>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the results of an experimental campaign conducted on a recently developed fire protection system (FPS), specifically designed for installation on continuous glass curtain walls systems typical of multi-story buildings. Design/methodology/approach The authors will first present the theoretical derivation of the relevant parameters to characterize and predict the fire evolution and probability of flashover, according to existing codes and standards. Then, the results of two full-scale tests will be presented in terms of temperature fields, thermal gradients and position of the neutral plane. Findings The experimental evidence shows how the proposed system is able to dramatically reduce internal temperatures in the rooms interested by the fire, also allowing for safer evacuation procedures by increasing the height of the neutral plane. Originality/value The novel window frame element comprises an automatic doubly convergent aperture system that induces ventilation in the compartment by increasing internal convection in the rooms subject to the fire. This allows for an efficient dispersion of hot gases and fumes and a drastic improvement in safety for both the occupants and firefighting operators. The theoretical results are then compared to the experimental evidence to evaluate the performance of the proposed ventilation system in the context of existing standards and design procedures.<sep>Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP) are a relatively new construction material. Their attractive features, such as lightness and durability, are currently paving an attractive way for structural engineering applications. However, since their mechanical properties are strongly influenced by the arrangement of the fibers (which is dictated by the production process), more research is still needed to fully characterize the material and to predict its behavior under different multi-axial actions. In this regard, the goal of the present manuscript is to shed light on these aspects by means of numerical analyses according to a lattice modeling approach proposed in (Fascetti et al., 2016) for FRP materials and herein modified to better capture the uniaxial alignment of pultruded elements. Novelty of the work and main contribution to the field is the definition of a numerical procedure for the saturation of the computational domain with different pointsets (i.e. a regular and a random one) in order to increase the accuracy of the method. The proposed approach is validated for tensile loadings, both in terms of mechanical properties and failure modes, through a parametric investigation carried out to simulate the results of the experimental campaign reported in Quadrino et al. (2018) which employed small-scale specimens directly extracted from pultruded glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) beams.<sep>Abstract This article presents a stochastic modeling approach for simulating the mechanical behavior of pervious concrete, based on novel extensions of the lattice discrete particle model. Selected digital images of the internal mesostructure, obtained from physical specimens, are used to survey material features and produce statistically representative descriptions of the pore networks. A procedure for estimating the statistical features of the mesostructure is proposed, and samples of a spatially correlated random field are utilized to numerically reproduce the distribution of the large, connected pores in the material. The numerical samples are linked to the topology of the lattice network by means of two novel techniques proposed herein: (1) a random placement procedure for the poly‐sized spheres representing coarse aggregate and (2) a ray tracing technique, which is used to evaluate the effective distributions of mass, stiffness, and strength of each lattice element according to the local distribution of porosity. Numerical results demonstrate how the proposed model is capable of simulating both the large scatter in strength and the variety of failure modes that are observed when testing physical specimens of pervious concrete. The proposed procedure is generally applicable to different types of materials with varying porosity, opening up new possibilities for the simulation of porous media by means of lattice discrete particle modeling techniques.<sep>Recent disruptive advancements in the fields of robotics, advanced manufacturing and parametric design will transform the construction industry in the next decades. In this article, we take advantage of the possibilities offered by these technologies to develop a new family of universal construction components that we called “droxels”. They bring together many characteristics that make them suitable for both robotic operations and traditional construction: they make it possible to materialize any 3D surface or volume with good structural stability, they allow an easy interlocking with a large laying tolerance, and they avoid scaffolding thanks to carefully chosen intermediate construction phases. Possible materials are polymers, timber, and concrete. In particular, polymers allow filling the droxels with water, or insulation, or sand, or recycled ballast. However, droxels have a complex geometry defined by eight parameters. The aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to characterize the influence of each of them on the characteristics of droxels and droxel-based engineering structures, such as the quality of interlocking or the feasibility of cantilevers. The methodology consists of an analytical and geometrical approach based on parametric design tools developed in Grasshopper. Finally, the results of the parametric study confirm that droxels can be used for many practical applications and a synthesis is given in order to guide the designer in the choice of the geometrical parameters, according to the characteristics of the structure and the construction process.<sep>Pultruded Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) are innovative structural elements that are experiencing a steady increase in use for different structural applications. Due to their appealing properties that set them apart from traditional construction materials, such as magnetic transparency and excellent strength-to-weight ratio, numerous experimental and numerical studies have been performed in the last decades to assess their performance as structural components. The description of the micro- and macro-scale mechanical features of FRP elements requires multiple levels of information to be accurately characterized to predict their strength, and as a result, researchers have developed computational models with varying levels of complexity to parametrize their response and investigate design parameters through numerical simulations. This paper presents a critical review of the current state-of-the-art in numerical modeling of structural fiber-reinforced polymeric elements for the prediction of their mechanical behavior under serviceability and failure limit state conditions, with particular attention devoted to pultruded Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP), and their use as load-bearing structural elements. The most commonly adopted numerical methods for the solution of this set of problems range from classical Finite Element Method (FEM) approaches to eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM), Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT), Cohesive Zone Modeling (CZM), Multiscale Reduced Order Modeling (ROM), as well as Random Lattice Modeling (RLM) techniques recently developed by the co-authors. Each one of these methods has its own distinctive features and brings specific challenges and capabilities that will be presented and discussed in detail in the manuscript. This paper, therefore, aims at illustrating the reliability of existing numerical models for the simulation of FRP structural elements and draw conclusions and recommendations for future research, discussing 160 references from the available literature.<sep>The research presented herein pertains to the experimental characterization and numerical simulation of the behavior of pultruded Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) structural elements, with specific attention devoted to enhancing ultimate capacity of the Web-Flange Junctions (WFJs). An experimental campaign, performed on as-manufactured I-beam specimens is conducted to serve as a baseline for comparing behavior of pultruded GFRP members with the proposed stiffening strategy. The specimens were produced through the addition of external elements, using bonded L-shaped profiles with variable lengths that were installed in the proximity of the WFJ zone of the I-beams. The experimental tests aimed at highlighting the inherent premature failure that potentially occurs at the WFJ as a result of lack of reinforcement continuity between the flanges and the web that are required to withstand localized radial stress concentration at these locations. To this end, the top flanges of the thin-walled GFRP I-beams were clamped while a localized concentrated load was applied on the bottom flange by means of a steel jaw. Two sets of tests were performed, namely Mid-Point (MP) and End-Point (EP), according to the location of the applied load that caused delamination, and eventually separation of the bottom flange from the web. Failure modes observed in the tests, together with experimental load–displacement curves, are used to investigate the influence of external stiffeners length on the ultimate strength and stiffness of the I-beams. In executing the tests, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques were used to track the spatial distribution of the deformation in the elements. Based on the results of the experimental campaign, a numerical investigation was conducted, to characterize the influence of different stiffeners’ arrangements on the mechanical response of the GFRP elements. The computational model was validated by comparing the observed response, both in terms of measured force–displacement curves, and bi-dimensional displacement maps obtained by means of the DIC technique. Numerical results highlighted the importance and influence of an explicit representation of the mechanical response of the bonding agent (i.e., the epoxy resin used to attach the stiffeners to the I-beams) to correctly characterize the deformation behavior of the strengthened WFJs.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Shrinkage<sep>Magnetite<sep>Thixotropy<sep>Expansive<sep>Precast concrete<sep>Ultimate tensile strength<sep>Spall<sep>Absorption (acoustics)<sep>Radiation shielding<sep>Overlay<sep>Compressive strength<sep>Variety (cybernetics)<sep>Hematite<sep>Durability<sep>Structural material<sep>Asphalt<sep>Bridge (graph theory)<sep>Aggregate (composite)<sep>Cracking<sep>Nuclear power<sep>Conceptual design<sep>Electromagnetic shielding<sep>Conceptual framework<sep>Retrofitting</keyword><title>Effect of elevated temperature to radiation shielding of ultra-high performance concrete with silica sand or magnetite<sep>fib Bulletin 99.

Hence this paper presents a study on the radiation shielding properties of UHPC after exposure to elevated temperature. It was found that the half-value layer and tenth value layer of both types of UHPC tested had increased by 76–82%, which was attributed to the excessive spalling and cracking that occurred. Magnetite was found to be slightly better than silica sand for radiation shielding.<sep>The purpose of this document is to present preliminary design procedures for bridge superstructures that are made partially or completely of precast concrete. This document deals with continuous and simply supported superstructures, used in integral or nonintegral bridges. The document is intended for engineers with limited experience who will find it an instructive detailed guide to carry out conceptual design of superstructures of these types. Additionally, it is intended for experienced engineers who are interested in learning how different countries solve similar conceptual design problems. Finally, it is intended to enrich the knowledge of precasters everywhere, to be able to enhance their own designs with ideas and methods from many different countries.<sep>This study aims to develop a new thixotropic ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) overlay for the repair and strengthening of damaged hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavements. The overlay is purposely designed to accommodate the roadway slope of up to 10% due to presence of viscosifying agent materials. The original UHPC materials are comprised of granite aggregate, ultra-fine calcium carbonate, shrinkage-reducing admixture, viscosifying agent, and expansive agent. The study is conducted with three sets of samples provided and considers thixotropic and mitigated shrinkage properties through comparing control (non-thixotropic) overlay 1 (thixotropic), and overlay 2 (thixotropic) mixtures. Based on the obtained results, only overlay 1 corresponds to the minimum requirement for pavement rehabilitation, with 160-200 mm flowability and -545.3 µm/m free shrinkage. As a result, an average 50 mm thick overlay 1 is selected to repair a damaged HMA pavement (1800 m2), while the field implementation procedures and drawing details are also presented in this paper.<sep>Minerals, for instance barite and hematite, absorb γ-rays better than silica aggregates because of their higher density. The use of these minerals as main component in ultra-high performance concretes (UHPCs) exhibit promising results and enhances the toughness of an ideal radiation absorber for nuclear facilities. However, limited information on the influence of high-density minerals on UHPC for radiation shielding is available. In this study, two UHPC mixes with hematite and barite minerals were investigated. The hardened characteristics of each UHPC like modulus of rupture, compressive strength and tensile strength, have been investigated. In addition, measurements were carried out to measure the radiation absorption characteristics of UHPC using 137Cs (3 mCi) and 60Co (2.5 mCi) sources that discharge 1.33 MeV and 0.66 MeV photons, respectively. Simulation of radiation shielding of UHPC using Monte Carlo software for Dry Cask was performed to study the radiation absorption capability of the mixes. It is found that hematite aggregate has smaller pore diameter compared to barite aggregate; thus, it is exhibited a large surface area, causing water absorption and reduced workability. Barite UHPCs showed the lowest compression strength due to a lesser percentage of Si and Fe elements. However, all UHPCs samples achieved high compression strength (>130 MPa) at 28 days. Although barite revealed higher potential to be used as gamma-ray shield because of its higher density, however, it can be concluded that the production of UHPC with silica sand is suitable for the construction of ionizing radioactivity facilities because of the abundance and low costs of the minerals.<sep>Nuclear energy offers a wide range of applications, which include power generation, X-ray imaging, and non-destructive tests, in many economic sectors. However, such applications come with the risk of harmful radiation, thereby requiring shielding to prevent harmful effects on the surrounding environment and users. Concrete has long been used as part of structures in nuclear power plants, X-ray imaging rooms, and radioactive storage. The direction of recent research is headed toward concrete's ability in attenuating harmful energy radiated from nuclear sources through various alterations to its composition. Radiation shielding concrete (RSC) is a composite-based concrete that was developed in the last few years with heavy natural aggregates such as magnetite or barites. RSC is deemed a superior alternative to many types of traditional normal concrete in terms of shielding against the harmful radiation, and being economical and moldable. Given the merits of RSCs, this article presents a comprehensive review on the subject, considering the classifications, alternative materials, design additives, and type of heavy aggregates used. This literature review also provides critical reviews on RSC performance in terms of radiation shielding characteristics, mechanical strength, and durability. In addition, this work extensively reviews the trends of development research toward a broad understanding of the application possibilities of RSC as an advanced concrete product for producing a robust and green concrete composite for the construction of radiation shielding facilities as a better solution for protection from sources of radiation. Furthermore, this critical review provides a view of the progress made on RSCs and proposes avenues for future research on this hotspot research topic.<sep>Ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) offers significant potential to address a variety of needs in bridge design, construction, and performance enhancement. Bridge owners have shown willingness to embrace novel solutions that could address specific challenges related to the cost, speed of construction, durability, and service life of their projects. There are hundreds of bridges worldwide that, largely in the past decade, have utilized UHPC. These applications range from minor field-cast closures to precast segments for long-span bridges to kilometer-long bridge deck overlays on a signature structure. The objective of this paper is to promote the application of this class of cementitious material in bridge engineering by presenting the progress that has been made in different regions of the world in the past two decades. Today, UHPC is being widely used in Malaysia to design and construct many bridges of different types and spans as they build out their roadway network. In South Korea, the unique characteristics of UHPC are being utilized to advance the state-of-the-art in long-span bridges. The French were early adopters and pioneers in building a strong foundation for using UHPC in a variety of bridge applications. In Switzerland, UHPC is employed to address major bridge rehabilitation needs. The United States bridge sector has embraced UHPC for a variety of field-cast connections. Current research and development efforts are promoting the use of UHPC in major rehabilitation projects and construction of primary bridge components. The adoption of UHPC solutions into the bridge sector is progressing rapidly because of the unique opportunities provided by the strength and durability of the material. It is expected that additional innovations and refinements of solutions will occur as knowledge of the material proliferates.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/68640/lecturer-in-electrical-energy/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5062675714", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5076687512", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in photovoltaics and nanophotonics, with extensive research experience in semiconductor device modeling, optical modeling, and semiconductor characterization techniques, aligning closely with the job requirements.

However, developmental changes, antigen recognition, cell migration, and their contributions to pathogen clearance remain largely unknown. We have recently shown that porcine γδ T cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and that TLR7/8 stimulation can function as a co-stimulatory signal that complements cytokine-induced signals to enhance INFγ production. Nonetheless, the signaling pathways behind this increased cytokine responsiveness remained unclear. Here, we analyzed the signaling pathways by measuring cellular kinase activity and selective inhibition, confirming that the TLR7/8 expression by γδ T cells is indeed functional. Moreover, TLR downstream signaling responses showed a distinct age-dependency, emphasizing the importance of age in immune function. While the TLR7/8 co-stimulation depended on activation of IRAK1/4, p38 and JNK in adult-derived γδ T cells, γδ T cells from young pigs utilized only p38, indicating the existence of an alternative signaling pathway in young pigs. Overall, this data suggests that porcine γδ T cells could be able to recognize viral RNA through TLR7/8 and subsequently support the survival and activation of the adaptive immune response by cytokine production.<sep>Gamma-Delta (γδ) T cells represent a prominent lymphocyte subset in pigs. Their role and function, however, remains largely unknown. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are key receptors for the recognition of pathogens, but so far, it is unknown if porcine γδ T cells express TLRs and therefore have the innate ability to recognize pathogens through pattern recognition receptors. In this study, we compared γδ T cells in different age groups of pigs and investigated the functional relevance of TLR7/8 expression. We found that the major γδ T cell phenotype shifts from CD2−CD8α−/dimCD27+ in young pigs to CD2+CD8αhighCD27− in 3-year-old pigs impacting their ability to produce IFN-γ upon cytokine and TLR stimulation. Furthermore, we report that stimulation with TLR7/8 ligand R848 increased IFN-γ production in purified γδ T cells upon co-stimulation with IL-2 and IL-12. However, the effect of R848 as a co-activator of γδ T cells was abrogated by the addition of monocytes or within PBMCs, suggesting that γδ T cells respond to multiple direct and indirect stimulations. Thus, our results indicate that γδ T cells express TLRs, are modulated by TLR7/8 ligand R848 and have subset-specific responses.<sep>SARS-CoV-2 variants and seasonal coronaviruses continue to cause disease and coronaviruses in the animal reservoir pose a constant spillover threat. Importantly, understanding of how previous infection may influence future exposures, especially in the context of seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants, is still limited. Here we adopted a step-wise experimental approach to examine the primary immune response and subsequent immune recall toward antigenically distinct coronaviruses using male Syrian hamsters. Hamsters were initially inoculated with seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, or HCoV-OC43), or SARS-CoV-2 pango B lineage virus, then challenged with SARS-CoV-2 pango B lineage virus, or SARS-CoV-2 variants Beta or Omicron. Although infection with seasonal coronaviruses offered little protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, HCoV-NL63-infected animals had an increase of the previously elicited HCoV-NL63-specific neutralizing antibodies during challenge with SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, primary infection with HCoV-OC43 induced distinct T cell gene signatures. Gene expression profiling indicated interferon responses and germinal center reactions to be induced during more similar primary infection-challenge combinations while signatures of increased inflammation as well as suppression of the antiviral response were observed following antigenically distant viral challenges. This work characterizes and analyzes seasonal coronaviruses effect on SARS-CoV-2 secondary infection and the findings are important for pan-coronavirus vaccine design.<sep>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can cause the life-threatening acute respiratory disease called COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) as well as debilitating multiorgan dysfunction that persists after the initial viral phase has resolved. Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is manifested by a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, dyspnea, arthralgia, myalgia, heart palpitations, and memory issues sometimes affecting between 30% and 75% of recovering COVID-19 patients. However, little is known about the mechanisms causing Long COVID and there are no widely accepted treatments or therapeutics. After introducing the clinical aspects of acute COVID-19 and Long COVID in humans, we summarize the work in animals (mice, Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and nonhuman primates (NHPs)) to model human COVID-19. The virology, pathology, immune responses, and multiorgan involvement are explored. Additionally, any studies investigating time points longer than 14 days post infection (pi) are highlighted for insight into possible long-term disease characteristics. Finally, we discuss how the models can be leveraged for treatment evaluation, including pharmacological agents that are currently in human clinical trials for treating Long COVID. The establishment of a recognized Long COVID preclinical model representing the human condition would allow the identification of mechanisms causing disease as well as serve as a vehicle for evaluating potential therapeutics.<sep>Abstract Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or the continuation of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) symptoms past 12 weeks may affect as many as 30% of people recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) infection. The mechanisms regulating the development of PASC are currently not known; however, hypotheses including poor antibody responses have been suggested. Due to the importance of virus neutralizing antibodies during COVID-19 recovery and protection from reinfection, we designed a cross-sectional study to investigate systemic antibody and cytokine responses during COVID-19 recovery and PASC. In total, 195 participants were recruited in one of five groups: 1.) those who had PASC (PASC); 2.) those who recovered from COVID-19 (Recovered); 3.) those in acute recovery (Acute Recovery); 4.) those experiencing acute COVID-19 (Acute COVID-19); and 5.) those who never had COVID-19 (No COVID). Participants completed a questionnaire detailing their demographics, as well as COVID-19 experiences. Serum samples were evaluated for virus binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as serum cytokine levels. We found that participants with PASC reported more pre-existing conditions (such as hypertension), and PASC symptoms (ie., shortness of breath) following COVID-19 than Recovered individuals. PASC individuals also had significantly decreased levels of neutralizing antibodies toward both SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.1 variant. Sex analysis indicated that female PASC study participants had sustained antibody levels as well as inflammatory cytokines (GM-CSF) over time following COVID-19 while males had decreasing concentrations. Our study reports for the first time that people experiencing PASC have lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies and females experiencing PASC have sustained levels of antibodies and inflammatory markers. With lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, this data suggests that PASC individuals not only have had a suboptimal antibody response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but may also have increased susceptibility to subsequent infections which may exacerbate or prolong current PASC illnesses. The work may be applied directly to developing PASC diagnostic screening tools, treatments, as well as public health policies.<sep>Abstract Our biggest challenge to reducing the burden of seasonal influenza is the constant antigen drift of circulating influenza viruses which then evades the protection of pre-existing immunity. Continual viral infection and influenza vaccination creates a layered immune history in people, however, how host preimmunity interacts with an antigenically divergent virus exposure is poorly understood. Here we investigated the influence of host immune histories on influenza viral mutations. Immune backgrounds were devised in mice similar to what is experienced in people: naive; previously infected (A/FM/1/1947); previously vaccinated (Sanofi quadrivalent vaccine); and previously infected and then vaccinated. Mice were challenged with the heterologous H1N1 strain A/Mexico/4108/2009 to assess protection, viral mutation, and host responses in respect to each immune background by RNAseq. Viral sequences were analyzed for antigenic changes using DiscoTope 2.0 and Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) Analysis Resource NetMHCpan EL 4.1 servers. The mock infected-vaccinated group consistently had the greatest number of viral mutations seen across several viral proteins, HA, NA, NP, and PB1 which was associated with strong antiviral responses and moderate T cell and B cell responses. In contrast, the preimmune-vaccinated mice were not associated with variant emergence and the host profiles were characterized by minimal antiviral immunity but strong T cell, B cell, and NK cell responses. This work suggests that the infection and vaccination history of the host dictates the capacity for viral mutation at infection through immune pressure. These results are important for developing next generation vaccination strategies. Importance Influenza is a continual public health problem. Due to constant virus circulation and vaccination efforts, people have complex influenza immune histories which may impact the outcome of future infections and vaccinations. How immune histories influence the emergence of new variants and the immune pressure stimulated at exposure is poorly understood. Our study addressed this knowledge gap by utilizing mice that are preimmune to influenza viruses and analyzing host responses as well as viral mutations associated with changes in antigenicity. Importantly, we found previous vaccination induced immune responses with moderate adaptive immunity and strong antiviral immunity which was associated with increased mutations in the influenza virus. Interestingly, animals that were previously infected with a heterologous virus and also vaccinated had robust adaptive responses with little to no antiviral induction which was associated with no emergence of viral variants. These results are important for the design of next generation influenza vaccines.<sep>Abstract Coronaviruses are a significant threat to public health, animal welfare, and economic stability. SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses continue to cause disease and coronaviruses in the animal reservoir pose a constant spillover threat. Immunological imprinting is a term meant to represent the strong influence of the first viral infection on the outcome of subsequent related viral infections or vaccination, with “Original Antigenic Sin” having historically been applied to the potential negative effects of such imprinting. Little is known, however, about the imprinting potential between seasonal and severe coronaviruses of zoonotic origin and the regulation of cross-reactive responses, positive or negative, upon secondary or subsequent exposures. Here we adopted a step-wise experimental approach to examine the imprinting response and subsequent immune recall toward antigenically distinct coronaviruses at various distances using the Syrian hamster model. This approach enabled the experimental evaluation of cross-reactivity and cross-protection among coronaviruses which has not been previously done. Hamsters were imprinted with seasonal coronaviruses including alphacoronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E) and betacoronaviruses (HCoV-OC43), or the original SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan virus (also a betacoronavirus). Seasonal CoV imprinting was followed by challenge with the original SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan virus representing distant imprinting-challenge combinations. Wuhan imprinting was followed by homologous Wuhan challenge or heterologous Beta or Omicron variants of concern to assess responses along a continuum of SARS-CoV-2 inter-relatedness. Weight loss and temperature as well as viral load, antibody induction, and host gene profiling for interferon responses, inflammation, and germinal center reactions were analyzed. Although imprinting with seasonal coronaviruses offered little protection against a SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan challenge in terms of viral replication and weight loss, NL63 imprinted animals mounted antigenic sin-like antibody responses while T cell gene signatures were noted in OC43 imprinted animals. The more similar imprinting-challenge regimens led to minimal or no viral replication. Subtle differences in the host responses were noted between Omicron and Beta challenges, suggesting Omicron to be more antigenically distant from Wuhan than the Beta variant. Host gene expression profiling analysis indicated interferon responses and germinal center reactions to be induced during more similar imprinting-challenge combinations while inflammation and antiviral response suppression were signatures in antigenically distant viral challenges. This work is the first characterization and analysis of seasonal coronavirus infection in animals and the subsequent effects on secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results are important for calculating the antigenic distance between coronaviruses and for determining positive or negative cross-reactive signatures. As we begin to construct a matrix of protection, these data may inform the design of pan-coronavirus vaccines and the components needed in a multivalent platform to protect against antigenically distinct groups of coronaviruses while mitigating the risk of negative interference.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/508308", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5014696412", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5056300023", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates extensive experience in respiratory diseases, immunology, and stem cell biology, with a strong focus on veterinary medicine, which aligns closely with the research focus of the LIU-CVM postdoctoral position.

It argues that a ‘new normal’ should acknowledge the ‘new essential’ (jobs and sectors). It looks at lessons that can be learned from this crisis in areas that were topical before the outbreak and are likely to be even more so after it. These include first the need to steer digital transformation so as to minimize negative impacts on jobs and sectors while critically reflecting on their ‘essentiality’ and second, at a time in history when data intensive sectors are gaining momentum, the need for a concerted policy action to ensure good governance of health data.<sep>ABSTRACT This article revisits and empirically tests the conjecture that specialization in natural resource industries (NRI) might not necessarily be a ‘curse’ for developing countries if it generates opportunities for export diversification in backward‐linked sectors à la Hirschman. The article systematizes the evolution of the debate around the NRI ‘curse’. Then it empirically tests whether NRI might represent a sufficient ‘domestic representative demand’ à la Linder to favour diversification into backward‐linked sectors such as knowledge‐intensive business services and high‐tech manufacturing. It focuses on the former and discusses the new opportunities for export diversification led by virtuous pathways of domestic structural change. It finds novel, quantitative empirical support for this conjecture, which complements extant qualitative literature and discusses implications that revisit the NRI curse debate.<sep>The paper provides a novel, theoretically driven map of EU regional asymmetries, based on the shares and dynamics of high-tech employment and wages, as well as the structure of inter-regional Input- Output relations at the EU NUTS-1 regional level. We use data from EUROSTAT and the EU-REGIO database to perform a trade-aware shift- share analysis coupled with a hierarchical clustering. We show that EU regions present a fractal structure of asymmetries, i.e. the emergence of core-periphery relations at progressively smaller scales, in relation to both spatial and trade dimensions. We identify regional clusters labelled 'consolidated core', 'declining core', 'emerging cities', 'declining peripheries' and 'CEE factories', and we show that there is a polarising dynamics between driving and follower clusters, drawing implications for EU cohesion policy.<sep>This paper puts forward and empirically tests the conjecture that specialisation in Natural Resource Industries (NRI) might not necessarily be a ‘curse’ for (developing) countries, if it provides opportunities for export diversification in backward linked sectors a la Hirschman. We first revisit the evolution of the debate around the NRI ‘curse’, including those from scholars sceptical of diversification based on beneficiation from NRI. We then empirically test whether NRI might represent a sufficient “domestic representative demand” a la Linder for backward linked sectors such as Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) or high tech manufacturing that might provide new opportunities for export diversification led by virtuous pathways of domestic structural change. We find empirical support for this conjecture and discuss some implications that revisit the NRI curse debate.<sep>This paper explores the new policy challenges that have emerged as a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The “new normal” should acknowledge the “new essential” in terms of jobs and sectors. First, the paper examines the trade-off between health policies and anti-recessionary policies. It studies the economic impact of lockdown on households and firms and, relatedly, the slowdown in global value chain-related trade. It the examines lessons that can be learned from this crisis in areas that were topical before the outbreak and are likely to be even more so after it. These include the need to steer digital transformation so as to minimize negative impacts on jobs and sectors while reflecting critically on their “essentiality” and the need for concerted policy action to ensure good governance of health data.<sep>This note selectively unpacks the rapid evolution of the (Western) debate around the opportunity to deploy contact tracing apps, alongside other digital tools such as apps for symptoms sharing and immunity certificates to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemics. I do so from the perspective of a social scientist interested in the implications of the development of digital tools at times of emergency in terms of data governance. I argue that a more articulated reflection is needed towards the development of a healthy institutional structure that regulates the role of large tech platforms, such as Google and Apple (G&A), and public institutions, in governing data, particularly when health data and public value are involved. I unravel the saga of contact tracing apps in the UK and EU, looking at the technical, legal and ethical aspects and I attempt to draw more general lessons for data governance.<sep>Abstract This article looks at the determinants of a country’s participation in business services (BS) global value chains (GVCs). BS GVCs are comparatively less explored than traditional manufacturing ones, and there is a gap in the literature on the relative positions of countries in BS GVCs and the opportunities they might open for development. This article puts forward and finds empirical support to the conjecture that the domestic structure of backward and forward linkages à la Hirschman, alongside the domestic representative demand for BS à la Linder, are of high importance. The results, based on the World Input-Output Database, suggest that the presence of strong domestic backward-linked industries to BS makes an emerging country more likely to create domestic value within BS GVC. Our findings contribute to the debate on a “premature de-industrialization” in emerging countries and on the relationship between levels of development and engagement in BS GVCs.<sep>We build upon the evolutionary model developed in prior works (Ciarli, Lorentz, Savona and Valente 2010b), which formalises the links between production, organisation and functional composition of the employment on the supply side and the endogenous evolution of consumption patterns on the demand side. The main contribution resulting from the exercise proposed here is to derive the Kaldorian cumulative causation mechanism as an emergent property of the dynamics generated by the micro-founded model. More precisely, we discuss the main transition dynamics to a self-sustained growth regime in a two-stage growth patterns generated through the numerical simulation of the model. We then show that these mechanisms lead to the emergence of a Kaldor-Verdoorn law. Finally we show that the structure of demand (among others the heterogeneity in consumption behaviour) itself shapes the type of growth regime emerging from the endogenous structural changes, fostering or hampering the emergence of the Kaldor Verdoorn law.<sep>This paper offers a brief reflection on the new policy challenges that have emerged as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It argues that a ‘new normal’ should acknowledge the ‘new essential’ (jobs and sectors). First, it examines the policy trade-off between containing the pandemic and avoiding a global recession. In particular, it looks at the economic impact of lockdown on households and firms and, relatedly, the slowdown in global value chain-related trade. Second, it looks at lessons that can be learned from this crisis in areas that were topical before the outbreak and are likely to be even more so after it. These include first the need to steer digital transformation so as to minimize negative impacts on jobs and sectors while critically reflecting on their ‘essentiality’ and second, at a time in history when data-intensive sectors are gaining momentum, the need for a concerted policy action to ensure good governance of health data.<sep>This paper provides empirical evidence on the role of technology in affecting the relationship between the participation of EU countries and industries in Global Value Chains (GVCs) and their employment structure over the period 2000–2014. The empirical analysis is based on country-sector level data for 21 EU countries on employment, trade in value added, patents and investments in intangible assets, and focusses on backward linkages within GVCs. The role of technology is analysed by taking into account both the technological intensity of country-sectors participating in GVC and that of their GVC partners. We study the employment structure by looking at the shares of managers and manual workers, which reflect the “functional specialisation” of the country-sector within GVCs. We find that participation in GVC per se is not related to the employment structure of a country-sector. We show that different patterns of GVC integration and functional specialisation emerge that depend on the initial patents/intangibles intensity of the country-sector integrating in GVC and those of the partners.<sep>Abstract The chapter proposes the foundations of an analytical framework to identify innovation pathways that lead to inclusive structural change in low- and medium-income countries (LMICs). Innovation pathways depend on how actors, interactions, and conditions affect the origin of innovation; the uptake of the innovations (adoption and diffusion); the impact of this diffusion on upgrading; the extent to which technological upgrading scales up to drive structural change and inclusion; the complementarity among these processes; and the potential trade-offs between structural change and inclusion. After delineating the analytical framework, the chapter focuses on applications of the framework to identify typical trade-offs between inclusion and structural change, and policy options to tackle these trade-offs and achieve outcomes of inclusive structural change. We finally propose a research agenda to build upon the framework and directly inform policies for inclusive structural change. The contribution of this work aims to respond to the recently increasing demand coming from international institutions, inter-departmental research funds, NGOs and national ministries, for improved knowledge to shape a more effective innovation policy for inclusive development in LMICs.<sep>The article revisits two classical approaches to development and trade, and offers an alternative account of the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) involving business services (BS), to trade-in-tasks theory. Based on this account, we propose what we call the Hirschman–Linder hypothesis (HLH), which predicts the need for an adequate ‘representative domestic’ (intermediate) demand for BS for countries to enter and upgrade in BS GVCs. We review the quantitative and qualitative empirical evidence supporting the HLH and find two main results: (i) countries with a substantial manufacturing core are more likely to participate (and eventually to upgrade) in BS GVCs, and (ii) countries endowed or specialized in natural resource industry (NRI), either the primary or extractive sectors are also likely to be part of BS GVCs. If BS GVCs represent globalization’s third unbundling for developing countries, the HLH suggests that on the one hand a core manufacturing sector is essential for entering and upgrading in BS GVCs, and on the other hand that if countries can diversify into BS and upgrade in BS GVCs specialization in natural resources might not necessarily be a curse.<sep>The paper offers a review of selected topics in the empirical literature on structural change and sustainability. We focus on aspects of structural change that directly affect emissions and energy intensity: changes of the sectoral composition of economies, trade and international fragmentation of production, technological change and innovation, and demand. We identify several empirical facts. First, only a few countries have experienced a decoupling between growth and emissions, due to proportionately faster growth rather than greater energy efficiency. Second, the long-term shift from manufacturing to services has not led, in all cases, to the de-materialisation of economies and a lower environmental burden. Exploitation of energy efficiency increases depends on the ability of the service sectors to incorporate technical changes to reduce energy intensity. Third, global trade and energy and emissions intensity trends support the ‘pollution haven’ hypothesis, which predicts displacement of the environmental burden from developed to emerging countries. The pursuit by developing countries of a long-term strategy of ‘trading jobs for emissions' is likely to exacerbate the asymmetry related to emissions intensities between developed and less developed economies. The review should inform debate on environmental policy within the broader context of innovation and development policies.<sep>We discuss how different models assessing climate change integrate aspects of structural change that are crucial to improve understanding of the relation between changes in the environment and in the economy. We identify six related aspects of structural change, which have significant impact on climate change: sectoral composition, industrial organisation, technology, employment, final demand, and institutions. Economic models vary substantially with respect to the aspects of structural change that they include, and how they model them. We review different modelling families and compare these differences: integrated assessment models (IAM), computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, structural change models (SCM), ecological macroeconomics models in the Keynesian tradition (EMK) and evolutionary agent based models (EABM). We find that IAM and CGE address few of the aspects of structural change identified; SCM focus on the sectoral composition; and EKM study final demand and employment structure. But all these models are aggregate and omit the complexity of the interactions between structural and climate change. EABM have explored a larger number of aspects of structural change, modelling their emergence from the interaction of microeconomic actors, but have not yet exploited their potential to study the interactions among interrelated aspects of structural and climate change.<sep>This paper provides empirical evidence on the relationship between patterns of integration in global value chains (GVCs), the ‘quality’ of such integration in terms of technological capabilities and the structure of employment in European countries and sectors. We study employment shares in fabrication and headquarter occupations in terms of functional specialisation and employment upgrading, making two specific contributions.First, we explicitly account for pre-existing asymmetries in employment structure. Second, we account for the complex role of technology both in terms of country-industries’ own initial technological intensity and that of their GVC partners. To achieve this we blend data on employment, trade in value added, patents and intangible asset stocks, for the period 2000-2014. We find that such pre-existing asymmetries are highly persistent over time with little sign of convergence in employment structure over our observed period.Furthermore GVC participation is not related, in and of itself, to changes in employment structure. However, this relationship appears to be mediated by country-industries’ initial technological position. Technological leaders exhibit greater shares of employment in headquarter functions as they increase their integration in GVCs; in contrast country-industries that start off as technological laggards see further integration in GVCs alongside an increase in the share of employment in fabrication functions.<sep>Abstract The paper provides a novel, empirically grounded map of innovation ‘clubs’ in the EU, based on a unique analysis of micro-aggregated, country-level data. Using exploratory factor analysis we articulate innovation variables in a taxonomy of four ‘latent’ innovation theories: Network-Innovation-System , Kaldorian , New-Growth-Theory , and Schumpeterian . We then characterise clusters of countries (‘clubs’), based on their performance against this taxonomy, and design a new map of EU innovation clubs. We identify an articulated map of EU innovation hierarchy beyond the rather well-known ‘core-periphery’ structure, and interpret how some of the peripheries are functional to the ‘consolidated core’ of innovative countries, raising an issue of long-term sustainability of such hierarchies. We also find that even the most innovative clusters show concerning weaknesses. The strongest cluster in terms of its innovation system does not seem to exploit its full potential and lags behind with respect to radical product innovations. Instead, the leading cluster in terms of radical product innovations is strongly dependent on external innovative activity, is focused on scale-intensive sectors, and has a fairly weak innovation system. The periphery of small countries that show a healthy network structure, do so because they mainly include supplier-dominated firms, reliant on innovation inputs from the core. We offer some reflections on innovation policy within a broader view of EU cohesion.<sep>This chapter aims at revisiting the empirical evidence on the recent trends of countries’ integration in global value chains in Europe. It investigates two potential sources of unbalances that these processes might relate to: (i) the sectoral specialization of the patterns of international fragmentation, whether high technology manufacturing or knowledge intensive services (KIBS); (ii) the occupational categories that have benefited or been penalized by these trends. A rich empirical mapping of these trends in the European countries is provided, based on OECD ICIO and EU ISCO data. The results on the overall and sectoral-specific trends of integration in GVCs and the associated changes in the shares of managers and manual workers show a dual-speed and qualitatively different integration patterns in Europe, with Eastern European (EE) countries rapidly integrating in high tech manufacturing, and the core of western countries strengthening their mutual integration in the KIBS area. Despite the relatively “good quality” integration of EE countries, the evidence does not seem to reveal a mirroring upgrading of employment structures. While this empirical contribution does not attempt to identify causal relationships, the picture provided in the chapter shows that, overall, integration in GVC seems to reproduce and perhaps exacerbate the initial asymmetries in the sectoral and employment structure, with manual workers occupation reducing overall and knowledge intensive occupations concentrating in western Europe.<sep>Abstract This paper aims at revisiting the empirical evidence on the recent trends of countries’ integration in global value chains (GVCs) in Europe.

The empirical analysis is based on country/industry level data for 21 EU countries on employment, trade in value added, patents and investments in intangible assets, and focusses on backward linkages within GVCs. The role of technology is analysed by taking into account both the technological intensity of offshoring industries and that of their GVC partners. We study the employment structure by looking at the shares of managers and manual workers, which reflect the “functional specialisation” of the country-sector within GVCs. We find that pre-existing asymmetries in the functional specialisation are highly persistent over time, with little sign of convergence over our observed period. Furthermore, GVC participation is not related to changes in the employment structure. However, this relationship appears to be mediated by country-industries’ initial technological performance. Technological leader industries exhibit, in fact, larger shares of employment in headquarter functions, and this functional specialisation tends to be strengthened as they increase their integration into GVCs. In contrast, country-industries that start off as technological laggards see integration into GVCs accompanied by an increase in the share of employment in fabrication functions. The technological profile of the partners is also found to play a role in the relationship between GVC integration and the functional specialisation of the offshoring country/industry, although different patterns emerge depending on the nature of the partner (manufacturing vs service).</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Disruptive innovation<sep>Social dynamics<sep>Theme (computing)<sep>Stakeholder<sep>Field (mathematics)<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>Healthcare industry<sep>2019-20 coronavirus outbreak<sep>Wireless<sep>Extant taxon<sep>Public interest<sep>Market structure<sep>Dynamics (music)<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>Digital economy<sep>Sharing economy<sep>Politics<sep>Product innovation<sep>Pandemic<sep>Architecture<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Banking industry<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Emerging technologies<sep>Digital media<sep>Social media<sep>Standardization<sep>Retail banking<sep>Framing (construction)<sep>Ecosystem<sep>Health care<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Digital transformation<sep>Industry 4.0<sep>Commercialization<sep>Business ecosystem<sep>Digital ecosystem<sep>Competition (biology)<sep>Set (abstract data type)<sep>Empirical research<sep>Business model<sep>Multinational corporation<sep>Cloud computing<sep>Big data<sep>Investment (military)<sep>Face (sociological concept)<sep>Barriers to entry<sep>Interoperability</keyword><title>The Covid-19 impact on fintech: now is the time to boost investment<sep>Category Kings and Commoners: Within and Across Cross-Category Spillovers in the Sharing Economy<sep>“Digital Colonization” of Highly Regulated Industries: An Analysis of Big Tech Platforms’ Entry into Health Care and Education<sep>Regulatory standards and consequences for industry architecture: The case of UK Open Banking<sep>“Platformification” of Banking: Strategy and challenges of challenger versus incumbent banks in UK<sep>Platforms in Highly Regulated Industries: An Analysis of GAFAM Entry into Healthcare and Education<sep>Digitalization and its Strategic Implications for the Multinational Enterprise<sep>Forced Ecosystems and Digital Stepchildren: Reconfiguring Advertising Suppliers to Realize Disruptive Social Media Technology<sep>Category Kings and Commoners: Within and Cross-Category SpillOvers in the Sharing Economy<sep>Social Entrepreneurs as Ecosystem Catalysts: The Dynamics of Forming and Withdrawing from a Self‐Sustaining Ecosystem<sep>Repeated Partnerships and Radical Innovation:Evidence from Wireless Gaming Market<sep>Digitalization Versus Regulation: How Disruptive Digital Communication Technologies Alter Institutional Contexts Through Public Interest Framing<sep>What is digital transformation?

We investigate the concepts of category kings and commoners in this empirical setting and we find that besides the previously established reputational spillovers, spill-overs in awareness, regulation, and customer usage are also present between category kings and commoners. We expand extant work on categories by discussing the impact of those category spill-overs between category kings and commoners on the growth of a new field.<sep>Digital platforms have disrupted many sectors but have not yet visibly transformed highly regulated industries. This study of Big Tech entry in healthcare and education explores how platforms have begun to enter highly regulated industries systematically and effectively. It presents a four-stage process model of platform entry, which we term as “digital colonization.” This involves provision of data infrastructure services to regulated incumbents; data capture in the highly regulated industry; provision of data-driven insights; and design and commercialization of new products and services. The article clarifies platforms’ sources of competitive advantage in highly regulated industries and concludes with managerial and policy recommendations.<sep>In this inductive qualitative study, we analyze the standardization efforts in the UK banking sector via Open Banking regulations. We examine the role of regulatory standards and how these standards evolve, highlight key decisions and factors in the process of standardization, and show how the standards implementation can lead to the emergence of new roles and connections in the industry architecture. We find that standardization is a continuous, multi-stakeholder process where not only formulation decisions, but also the adjustment of industry players to roadblocks in implementation cause recalibration of standards and shifts in industry architecture. We also unravel the architectural implications of data sharing and interoperability standardization both within and across industries.<sep>This paper explores what advantages and challenges new players versus incumbents face in creating / transitioning to a platform business model in a regulated, data sensitive industry, in the context of UK retail banking. Through semi-structured interviews and observations during the 16 months before and 12 months after the introduction of open banking regulation, which triggered new entry by digital banks into the industry, we observed the platform formation attempts and challenges of established and new players in the industry. Our findings highlight the limitations of platform strategies and dynamics in highly-regulated, data sensitive industries and provide a nuanced view of platform emergence and industry transformation with attention to organizational context, interorganizational conflicts, and the regulatory environment.<sep>While platform firms have disrupted many sectors, they have not yet visibly transformed most regulated industries. However, we observe early signs of the onset of platformization in a few regulated sectors such as healthcare and education. In this study, we examine the challenges and opportunities that regulated industries present to big tech platforms. By examining GAFAM entry patterns into the education and healthcare sectors, we uncover a paradox: whereas GAFAM might be very well suited to solving these markets’ inefficiencies, they also are uniquely challenged by the sensitivity of the data emanating from these sectors’ social regulation. We develop propositions that identify various modes of platform entry in highly-regulated industries. We suggest that GAFAM modes of entry depend on their pre-entry resources and capabilities, and on the extent to which the primary services offered in the target industries are offered by centralized government actors.<sep>Abstract We have a diverse set of descriptions referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”, Industry 4.0, or the “digital” or “new economy”, indicating that there is a seismic shift under way. Due to digital transformation arising from the combined effect of several digital technologies including IoT, 5G, cloud, blockchain, big data and artificial intelligence, companies today are being transformed, and for many, this transformation comes in ways that they have not experienced before. This may mean that firms entering new markets with digital technologies may be less dependent on mediators and be able to control the delivery of their products or services, while new entrants are likely to gain advantages from exploiting digital platforms. The chapter lays out how the classic principles of international competitive strategy are transformed in today’s markets due to digitalization and provides suggestions in terms of how firms, and particularly multinational enterprises (MNEs), can respond to these transformations.<sep>Research often examines disruption in the context of head-to-head competition between firms and technologies. In contrast, we examine the unique dynamics of disruptive technologies within supplier ecosystems. We do so through an inductive multiple case study set in the global advertising industry from 2008–2013, as the industry grappled with the emergence of social media. Using rich archival and field data, we closely track five global consumer goods manufacturers and their associated advertising suppliers as they attempted to integrate social media into their advertising activities. Our primary contribution is to unpack the process by which firms reconfigure their supplier ecosystems to address disruptive new technologies. Our framework reveals that integrating new technologies may require firms to reconfigure the distributions of both activity and power, and that fundamental trade-offs may leave the value of new technologies unrealized. Broadly, we contribute to research and theory on buyer-supplier relationships, alliances, and technology disruption by bringing a more realistic perspective that considers firms’ network of suppliers and interfirm turf wars in technology adoption.<sep>This chapter focuses on the largely unexplored within- and cross-category spillovers between category kings and commoners within the field of the sharing economy. Going beyond the reputational spill-overs that are the main focus of extant literature, the authors also consider spill-overs in awareness, regulation, and customer usage between category kings and commoners, providing a holistic view of what it means to be a commoner in the same or adjacent category as a king. On the basis of a mixed-method study based on semi-structured interviews with UK sharing platforms and a consumer survey, the authors show that category commoners are affected by kings differently depending whether they are in the exact same sub-category or in an adjacent one within the same larger category. This chapter expands extant work on within and cross-category dynamics by taking the less popular perspective of the less visible category members. Studying these dynamics in the setting of the sharing economy also contributes to the authors’ knowledge of what enables/hinders the growth of a new field as a whole. Finally, the findings have important policy implications.<sep>Abstract Creating a long‐lasting impact is one of the defining goals of social entrepreneurship. Yet, social entrepreneurs often face a dilemma between sustaining their organization and offering a permanent fix to a social problem. We question the assumption that organizational permanence and growth are intrinsically desirable for social entrepreneurs and propose an alternative, an inductively grounded model of ecosystem leadership, which we term ecosystem catalysis. Through a single case study of social entrepreneurs addressing the lack of access to diarrhoea treatment in Zambia, we conceptualize ecosystem catalysis as a process through which an organization forms an ecosystem around a new value proposition while gradually making itself redundant, ultimately withdrawing from the ecosystem without compromising its functioning. Our work contributes to ecosystem literature by contrasting the key aims and mechanisms of an ecosystem catalyst to those of an orchestrator and identifying the conditions under which catalysing may be a better choice than orchestrating an ecosystem. We contribute to social entrepreneurship literature by decoupling social impact from organizational growth and permanence and presenting a more dynamic model of social impact resulting from distributed contributions in ecosystems.<sep>Purpose - Firms often form alliances to manage innovation activities with prior or new partners. However, it is not clear whether repeated alliances might reduce or increase incremental versus radical innovations. This paper investigates the effect of repeated partnerships on firm´s innovations in a creative industry, namely mobile gaming industry. Specifically, the effects of publisher and carrier partnerships on new game releases with existing versus new genres. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical research was conducted using US mobile gaming industry data between 2003-2005 which covers the new games released in period after 3G introduction and before smartphones. Thus, included mobile games belong to the same generation in terms of mobile internet telecommunication technology. The effect of repeated partnerships between a publisher and a carrier on a mobile game genre was empirically tested with logistic regression. Findings - Repeated partnerships lead to lower likelihood of radical innovation. The likelihood of radical innovation was lower for a large size partner relative to small size partner. Discussion - This research contributes two streams of research: strategic alliance research and research on creative industries. The type of innovation repeated interactions lead to in creative industry context was examined and partner size was also introduced as an important factor. This study gives advices on firms who needs alliance and suggest to have more diverse portfolio to continue their radical innovations.<sep>In this paper, we investigate how digital technology disruptors and the incumbents who stand to be disrupted by them frame their arguments to transform or sustain existing institutional frameworks to enable or deter the market entry of these technologies. Using a longitudinal, comparative case analysis of three digital technologies – namely, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), cloud antenna, and over-the-top (OTT) technologies – we explore how stakeholders use public interest frames for this purpose. We find that entrepreneurs use three specific frames to drive institutional change for the successful adoption of digital technologies in the presence of established incumbents and powerful regulators: frames that emphasize the broad public appeal of the new digital technology; frames that emphasize efficiency, democracy, and technological advancement; and frames that emphasize present as well as future benefits to the public. We find that constructing interpretations of what serves the public interest is the primary tactic used by disruptors to gain market entry, and an equally popular weapon for incumbents to block the entry of new digital technologies. These interpretations lead to a framing contest aimed at influencing regulators and obtaining a more favorable institutional environment. Our empirical findings illustrate that new digital technologies themselves are not the sole contributors to institutional change. Rather, institutional outcomes associated with the introduction of new digital technologies are shaped by how disruptors and incumbents use public interest frames and how regulators react to these frames.<sep>Abstract Research summary Digital transformation is a dominant theme in the global economy, but what it means for established companies remains perplexing for both academics and practitioners. As digital erases familiar geographic, industrial, and organizational boundaries, it has led to simplistic characterizations such as “digital changes everything.” Yet while digital changes some things, others remain the same. Here, we identify three core tensions at the heart of digital transformation—products vs platforms, firms vs ecosystems, and people vs tools—and describe their underlying economics, driving forces, and countervailing forces. These tensions frame a concrete discussion of strategic alternatives for global companies. Overall, we emphasize that digital transformation is not an objective state, but rather a strategic choice by executives from an array of alternatives. Managerial summary Digital transformation is a dominant theme in the global economy, but what it means remains perplexing for executives and academics. Pundits claim that “digital changes everything” and that leaders must “disrupt or be disrupted,” but is this really true for established companies serving robust customer needs on the global stage? Understanding what digital transformation means can be challenging as it breaks down familiar geographic, industrial, and organizational boundaries, creating new opportunities and threats. In this paper, we explore three key tensions at the heart of digital transformation—products vs platforms, firms vs ecosystems, and people vs tools—and enumerate their enabling and constraining forces. Building on these concrete constructs provides effective foundations for formulating digital transformation strategy.<sep>This symposium explores the use of framing strategies by organizations in innovation contexts. While framing processes have been researched by political science, managerial and organizational cognition, and social movement scholars, researchers in strategic management and innovation fields have devoted less attention to how organizations use framing strategically to position their firms in relevant ecosystems and to communicate with various stakeholders about innovative new products or new business models. The symposium intends to shed light on the strategic use of framing for innovation to enable rigorous theorizing of this key organizational process. To this end, we bring together four research papers that explore different critical aspects of the process of framing and use of rhetoric in organizations: (1) framing strategies used by a new venture during ecosystem creation, (2) framing strategies used by incumbents to get a new entrant banned from the market , (3) the use of framing to re-define a low-status product category to a new high-status category, and (4) institutional differences of novel product framing in different countries. The symposium is intended to spur the continuous development of framing research at the intersection of strategic management and innovation fields. With the introduction to framing at the beginning and discussant comments as well as a Q&A at the end we will examine the core elements of framing and identify directions for future research on strategic use of framing in organizations.

The adaptations range from Frank Benson's film of Richard III in 1910 through to the company's current RSC Live from Stratford-upon-Avon event cinema screenings.<sep>In late July 2022, in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, the RSC Live from Stratford-upon-Avon team completed the recording of the project’s thirty-third production. Richard III, which was shown in cinemas from 28 September, brought to a close the company’s Histories Cycle of the past decade. It also marked former artistic director Gregory Doran’s final production before the appointment of Daniel Evans and Tamara Harvey as co-artistic directors in September.<sep>Barrie Gavin (b. 1935) is a celebrated producer, director and writer who is best known for numerous programmes about music and musicians made primarily for BBC Television from 1964 onwards. He worked on numerous occasions with the conductors Pierre Boulez and Simon Rattle, and with them and other collaborators he has directed more than 90 films. In this conversation recorded in Leeds in June 2018 Gavin discusses with the writer and producer John Wyver his ideas about making music television, his innovative approaches to filmmaking, his profiles of composers including Luigi Nono, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Toru Takemitsu, and his working relationships with Boulez and Rattle.<sep>These are interesting times for stage-to-screen adaptations, and for their creators, critics, and consumers. With theatres closed for well over a year, we have lived through an efflorescence of stage works appearing, for free or for modest fees, on televisions, laptops, and tablets. Many of these have been screen versions long preserved in the archives and released only fleetingly by broadcasters and cultural organizations. Companies large and small have also wrangled the technologies of Zoom, Teams, and more into digital-native approaches to theatre on screen. Hybrid performance forms have been forged to offer elements of virtual liveness, communality, and participation to isolated individuals everywhere. Two personal highlights from this world of wonders were the momentary availability in May 2020 of the 1957 recording for television in the GDR of the Berliner Ensemble’s original 1949 production of Bertolt Brecht’s Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder (Mother Courage and Her Children)...<sep><JATS1:p>No theatre company has been involved in such a broad range of adaptations for television and cinema as the Royal Shakespeare Company. Starting with Richard III filmed in the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre before World War One, the RSC’s accomplishments continue today with highly successful live cinema broadcasts. The Wars of the Roses (BBC, 1965), Peter Brook’s film of King Lear (1971), Channel 4’s epic version of Nicholas Nickleby (1982) and Hamlet with David Tennant (BBC, 2009) are among their most iconic adaptations. Many other RSC productions live on as extracts in documentaries, as archival recordings, in trailers and in other fragmentary forms.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>Screening the Royal Shakespeare Company explores this remarkable history of collaborations between stage and screen and considers key questions about adaptation that concern all those involved in theatre, film and television. John Wyver is a broadcasting historian and the producer of RSC Live from Stratford-upon-Avon, and is uniquely well-placed to provide a vivid account of the company’s television and film productions. He contributes an award-winning practitioner’s insight into screen adaptation’s numerous challenges and rich potential.</JATS1:p><sep>The two short films and essay published here come out of a collaborative research project on the aesthetic and historical qualities of Bert Hardy’s wartime and post-war photography for Picture Post. Developing the methodologies being explored in the field of videographic criticism, we use moving images to produce a visual exploration of the material and formal qualities of Bert Hardy’s photographs in the 1940s. Digital moving images and sound, we suggest, expand our potential understanding and analysis of Hardy’s work, in ways in which traditional written modes of criticism cannot. We use the poetic and expressive possibilities of our medium to highlight and examine those material qualities, along with the historical atmosphere of post-war visual media. The two films each explore a particular Hardy photo-story: Fire-Fighters! focuses on the themes of grain in the printed image, the facial close-up as an affective form of national expression, narrative sequence, and the move in the story from figuration to abstraction. The second film, Life in the Elephant develops the concept of narrative and photographic sequence and facial/emotional expression. It also considers the ways in which the photo-story expresses a sense of historical place. The accompanying article develops the historical contexts for the two photo-stories, the theoretical ideas motivating the project, and the technical processes and collaborative partnerships involved in making the films.<sep>Although Play for Today is a strongly contemporary series, for many of its dramas the Second World War and the immediate aftermath are years of considerable significance. Numerous plays refer explicitly to aspects of the war, and nine productions are set wholly or primarily between 1940 and 1945. This article focuses on five of these, all of which were made on film for the later seasons of Play for Today: Licking Hitler (1978), Blue Remembered Hills (1979), The Imitation Game (1980), Country (1980) and Rainy Day Women (1984). Each film aims to offer a revisionist understanding of the conflict, setting out to de-mythologise established myths about the war at home. This article argues that this ‘home front quintet’ forms a significant and, in part at least, a coherent group of dramas within the series. It seeks to identify connections across these dramas, and to understand their politics as engagements with the war and its aftermath during a period that the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher were consolidating power. My argument is that concerns with landscape, heritage and home, game-playing and simulation, and ideas of self-reflexivity are combined with generic aspects of the war film in ways that challenge understandings of the war at home but also fail to link their re-imaginings of the conflict to credible and progressive presentations of the post-war peace.<sep>Play for Today was a series of single dramas broadcast by the BBC between 1970 and 1984. These were years of crisis, a time when the consensus politics of Britain’s postwar world had begun to unravel. Industrial relations, education and the health service faced fundamental challenges, the country was struggling with the end of empire, and the personal had become increasingly political. Play for Today reflected and responded to all of this and more in 300 dramas, shown in primetime on BBC One to audiences numbered in millions. Many of the best actors, writers and directors of the time contributed to the series, with some of the best-remembered broadcasts being Mike Leigh’s Abigail’s Party, Dennis Potter’s Blue Remembered Hills and the strange fantasy, Penda’s Fen, written by Alan Rudkin and directed by Alan Clarke. The series was contemporary, often controversial and occasionally censored. But it was also immensely varied, showcasing social realism with comedy, costume drama with fantasy, and personal visions with state-of-the-nation overviews. It was mischievous, critical and challenging, and unafraid to tackle taboos. Marking the 50th anniversary of the first Play for Today in October 1970, this film is a celebration of the series, told by a number of its producers, directors and writers. It explores the origins of the series, its achievements and its controversies. Presenting a rich range of often surprising extracts from the archive, the film features interviews with, among others, producers Kenith Trodd, Margaret Matheson and Richard Eyre, film-makers Mike Leigh and Ken Loach, and writer and director David Hare.<sep>As an introductory overview of the history of stage plays on British television, this chapter locates a wide range of individual broadcasts from 1936 to 2020 within institutional and broader cultural histories. After a brief consideration of these broadcasts as screen adaptations, the chapter first traces the ways in which television presented productions created for the stage prior to any encounter with cameras—as outside broadcasts (OBs) or studio re-workings; it then parallels this with a chronicle of television’s own productions of plays written for the stage. Both strands of the history discuss the extensive output of stage plays from the BBC Television service before the Second World War, including the first broadcasts from theatres in London’s West End. Post-war BBC productions, including those from BBC2 after 1964, are contrasted with the presentations of stage plays by the new ITV companies from 1955 onwards. The decline in stage plays on mainstream television from the late 1960s onwards is outlined, together with their brief revival as theatre recordings in the first years of Channel 4. The chapter also recognises the almost complete absence of stage plays on television in the 1990s and early 2000s, reviewing possible reasons for this, before recognising the modest revival of theatre on television that followed the success of ‘event cinema’ screenings by NT Live and other initiatives in the 2010s. The chapter’s focus throughout is on the reasons why television has sought to adapt and produce both kinds of screen plays, and it concludes with a brief consideration of the value of performance recordings for BBC Television, especially during the pandemic lockdown from March 2020.<sep>In late 1968, Granada Television hired a group of actors—including the young Maureen Lipman, Richard Wilson and John Shrapnel—and converted a former railway building in Manchester into a fringe theatre. The intention was that The Stables Theatre Company would mount a programme of plays, a selection of which would be recorded in the television studio for broadcast, and for the next two years the ITV contractor supported The Stables as it mounted for local audiences an extensive and well-reviewed programme of plays and revues and recorded a number of these productions in the television studio. Apart from a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, all of these were new plays, the majority of which were commissioned by The Stables. After two years, however, Granada recognised that the venture could not be profitable and cut off its financial support. The Stables mounted a public appeal to continue without the broadcaster’s backing, but by the end of March 1971, the unique experiment was over. On no other occasion in British television history has a broadcaster owned and operated a theatre company. Drawing on an interview with the artistic director of The Stables, Gordon McDougall, press coverage of the relationship between The Stables and Granada, other documentation including company reports and private memos and viewings of three of the television productions preserved in the ITV archive, this chapter explores the aesthetic aspirations of The Stables project and the reasons for its failure. The chapter considers the fit between McDougall’s original idea and the interests of Granada Television and the company’s founder, Sidney Bernstein, who had expressed a wish to set up a theatre as a testing ground for new playwrights and plays. The legacy of The Stables includes support at an early stage in their careers for a number of prominent playwrights, including Arthur Hopcraft, Trevor Griffiths and Peter Ransley. But the problems posed by endeavouring to align the interests and concerns of a small theatre company shaped by a strong artistic vision with the industrial processes of commercial television production, combined with the financial loss incurred by Granada, meant that no comparable experiment was tried elsewhere.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Active listening<sep>Byzantine architecture<sep>Order (exchange)<sep>Mysticism</keyword><title><i>Holy, Holy, Holy:</i> Hearing the Voices of Angels</title><abstract>Were Byzantine writings about the intermingling of human and angelic voices within ecclesiastical settings merely reflections of mystical theology, or were they actual observations about the movement of sound?

Despite the on‐going use of outrigger systems around the world, a formal seismic design procedure is yet available. This paper presents an equivalent energy design procedure (EEDP) to design outrigger systems for seismic applications. Three prototype outrigger‐wall buildings of various heights are designed for Vancouver, Canada. Detailed finite element models are developed to assess the seismic performance of the prototype buildings and to assess the safety using the FEMA P695 methodology. The result shows that EEDP is an efficient method to design outrigger systems which results in structures that can achieve sufficient margin of safety against collapse and satisfy multiple performance objectives at different seismic hazard levels.<sep>Eccentrically braced frame (EBF) is a robust structural system designed for seismic application. The design philosophy for EBF is to utilize the link beams to dissipate the earthquake energy. While such system has been proven to provide sufficient stiffness and strength to prevent the structure from collapse, the structural performance in terms of damage and resilience after strong earthquakes is not explicitly considered. In this paper, a novel design method, named the Equivalent Energy Design Procedure (EEDP), is adopted to design the EBF. EEDP is an alternative design procedure for fused structural systems, where engineers can design the structure to achieve the intended performance objectives at different earthquake hazard levels. To evaluate the performance of the EBF, a 5 storey EBF located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is designed using both the EEDP and the Equivalent Static Force Procedure (ESFP) outlined in the 2015 National Building Code of Canada. Detailed nonlinear dynamic analyses were conducted. The results show that the EEDP designed EBF has better performance with lower initial and repair costs at different levels of earthquake shaking intensities.<sep>A dual-fused H-frame (DFHF) is an efficient structural system that combines damped H-frame (DHF) modules with welded wide flange fuses (WWFFs) to create a structural solution that is efficient in construction and more seismically resilient. Each DHF module consists of two columns pin connected to a beam with two buckling restrained knee braces (BRKBs). Each DHF module can be prefabricated at the factory, shipped to the site, and connected vertically using simple bolt connections. The connections between the DHF modules have relatively small moment demand, which makes the design, fabrication, and construction of the DHF modules very efficient. Once the DHF modules are assembled vertically, the bays of the DHF can be connected using WWFFs. WWFFs are simple shear connectors that can stably dissipate earthquake energy. In this paper, two prototype DFHF buildings of varying heights (three and nine stories) are designed using the equivalent energy design procedure (EEDP). The EEDP is a novel design method that was developed to design innovative systems, where the structural system can satisfy different performance objectives under different earthquake shaking intensities. To verify the performance of the DFHF, advanced finite-element models are developed using OpenSees and subjected to an extensive array of time history analyses. The results show that the proposed EEDP designed DFHF can meet the targeted performance objectives under different seismic shaking intensities. In addition, DFHF has a sufficient margin of safety against collapse. Hence, the proposed DFHF can be used as an efficient structural system in high seismic zones.<sep>Recent earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan showed that structures designed according to modern building codes might suffer significant damages with hefty financial and social losses. The primary reason lies in the seismic design approach, where most seismic force resisting systems (SFRS) were designed to prevent structures from collapse during strong earthquake shaking, without considering the damage and the usability of the structure after an earthquake. In this paper, a controlled rocking-concentrically braced frame (CR-CBF) is proposed. CR-CBF is a fused structural system that uses a combination of post-tensioned tendons (PTs) and energy dissipation devices (EDs) to create a controlled-rocking mechanism to minimize structural repair costs and down time after a strong earthquake. PTs are placed in the structure to provide the restoring forces and to minimize any residual deformation in the structure, while EDs are placed at the base of a structure to dissipate the earthquake energy. To ensure the CR-CBF can achieve high performance, two (CR-CBF) prototypes with different heights are designed using the novel equivalent energy design procedure (EEDP). The EEDP procedure allows designers to select different performance objectives at different shaking intensities. The results of nonlinear dynamic analyses of the CR-CBFs show that CR-CBFs have superior seismic performances as intended and can be efficiently designed using EEDP. Finally, the seismic performance of CR-CBF against collapse is assessed using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) outlined in the FEMA-P695 methodology. The results show that the CR-CBFs designed by EEDP have sufficient safety against collapse, hence it can be used as an efficient seismic force resisting system.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/12795951", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5083757418", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5027252388", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on risk management, safety, and security in complex systems, particularly in chemical and nuclear industries, which aligns well with the job's emphasis on signal processing and analysis in medical ultrasound imaging.

While several studies implicate the microbiome in this trend, few have examined the evolutionary history of industrialized microbiomes. Here we sampled 235 ancient dental calculus samples from individuals living in Great Britain (∼2200 bce to 1853 ce), including 127 well-contextualized London adults. We reconstructed their microbial history spanning the transition to industrialization. After controlling for oral geography and technical biases, we identified multiple oral microbial communities that coexisted in Britain for millennia, including a community associated with Methanobrevibacter, an anaerobic Archaea not commonly prevalent in the oral microbiome of modern industrialized societies. Calculus analysis suggests that oral hygiene contributed to oral microbiome composition, while microbial functions reflected past differences in diet, specifically in dairy and carbohydrate consumption. In London samples, Methanobrevibacter-associated microbial communities are linked with skeletal markers of systemic diseases (for example, periostitis and joint pathologies), and their disappearance is consistent with temporal shifts, including the arrival of the Second Plague Pandemic. This suggests pre-industrialized microbiomes were more diverse than previously recognized, enhancing our understanding of chronic, non-communicable disease origins in industrialized populations. DNA analysis of ancient dental calculus samples revealed distinct oral microbial communities, including the archaeon Methanobrevibacter, which was associated with hygiene, diet and health.<sep>Ancient DNA analysis of human oral microbial communities within calcified dental plaque (calculus) has revealed key insights into human health, paleodemography, and cultural behaviors. However, contamination imposes a major concern for paleomicrobiological samples due to their low endogenous DNA content and exposure to environmental sources, calling into question some published results. Decontamination protocols (e.g. an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) pre-digestion or ultraviolet radiation (UV) and 5% sodium hypochlorite immersion treatments) aim to minimize the exogenous content of the outer surface of ancient calculus samples prior to DNA extraction. While these protocols are widely used, no one has systematically compared them in ancient dental calculus. Here, we compare untreated dental calculus samples to samples from the same site treated with four previously published decontamination protocols: a UV only treatment; a 5% sodium hypochlorite immersion treatment; a pre-digestion in EDTA treatment; and a combined UV irradiation and 5% sodium hypochlorite immersion treatment. We examine their efficacy in ancient oral microbiota recovery by applying 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun sequencing, identifying ancient oral microbiota, as well as soil and skin contaminant species. Overall, the EDTA pre-digestion and a combined UV irradiation and 5% sodium hypochlorite immersion treatment were both effective at reducing the proportion of environmental taxa and increasing oral taxa in comparison to untreated samples. This research highlights the importance of using decontamination procedures during ancient DNA analysis of dental calculus to reduce contaminant DNA.<sep>Abstract Bacteria are not only ubiquitous on earth but can also be incredibly diverse within clean laboratories and reagents. The presence of both living and dead bacteria in laboratory environments and reagents is especially problematic when examining samples with low endogenous content (e.g., skin swabs, tissue biopsies, ice, water, degraded forensic samples or ancient material), where contaminants can outnumber endogenous microorganisms within samples. The contribution of contaminants within high‐throughput studies remains poorly understood because of the relatively low number of contaminant surveys. Here, we examined 144 negative control samples (extraction blank and no‐template amplification controls) collected in both typical molecular laboratories and an ultraclean ancient DNA laboratory over 5 years to characterize long‐term contaminant diversity. We additionally compared the contaminant content within a home‐made silica‐based extraction method, commonly used to analyse low endogenous content samples, with a widely used commercial DNA extraction kit. The contaminant taxonomic profile of the ultraclean ancient DNA laboratory was unique compared to modern molecular biology laboratories, and changed over time according to researcher, month and season. The commercial kit also contained higher microbial diversity and several human‐associated taxa in comparison to the home‐made silica extraction protocol. We recommend a minimum of two strategies to reduce the impacts of laboratory contaminants within low‐biomass metagenomic studies: (a) extraction blank controls should be included and sequenced with every batch of extractions and (b) the contributions of laboratory contamination should be assessed and reported in each high‐throughput metagenomic study.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Linear actuator<sep>Work (physics)<sep>Electrical conductor<sep>Trim<sep>Transient (computer programming)<sep>Aerodynamics<sep>Electromagnetic coil<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Insect flight<sep>Power density<sep>Magnet<sep>Flapping<sep>Energy consumption<sep>Control theory (sociology)<sep>Actuator</keyword><title>Feedback and Control of Linear Electromagnetic Actuators for Flapping Wing MAVs<sep>Energy Efficiency of Linear Electromagnetic Actuators for Flapping Wing Micro Aerial Vehicles<sep>Longitudinal Actuated Abdomen Control for Energy Efficient Flight of Insects<sep>Geometry of efficient Electromagnetic Linear actuators for flapping wing MAVs</title><abstract>We present a method for generating feedback and controlling multi-coil linear electromagnetic actuators for flapping wing systems. This has been achieved with a system capable of self-lifting, constructed using 3D-printed structures and miniaturised electromagnetic actuators with a combined weight of 3.07 g. Combining multiple magnets and coils into a single actuator with onboard feedback sensors has improved power densities upon existing linear electromagnetic systems present in the literature. The use of closed-loop control of the dynamics of the flapping profile allows for independent control of both flapping frequency and amplitude, which is differentiated from open-loop and resonance-based systems. This change will allow relatively precise control over the flapping dynamics of future systems while improving actuation efficiency.<sep>The development of flapping wing systems has been restricted by high power density requirements, comparatively large forces and the requirement for light weight. The use of linear electromagnetic actuators has had a small presence in the flapping wing literature when compared to other actuator types. This has been due to the high power consumption and low power output of this system when compared to resonant systems. This work assesses linear electromagnetic actuators presented in the literature and demonstrates the performance improvements achieved when the mechanism natural frequency is appropriately tuned. This process shows a reduction of input power consumption to 13% of the original power consumption. This improvement, combined with appropriate power electronic design, can reduce the perceived gap between linear electromagnetic actuators and solid-state actuators.<sep>The actuated abdomens of insects such as dragonflies have long been suggested to play a role in optimisation and control of flight.

We explore the benefits the abdomen/tail might provide to balance level flight against trim changes. We also consider the transient advantage of using alternative longitudinal control effectors in a pull up flight maneuver. Results show that the articulated abdomen significantly reduces energy consumption and increase performance in isolated manoeuvres. The results also indicate a design feature that could be incorporated into small unmanned aircraft under particular circumstances. We aim to highlight behaviours that would increase flight efficiency to inform designers of micro aerial vehicles and to aid the analysis of insect flight behaviour and energetics.<sep>Abstract A constraining factor in the development of flapping wing micro air vehicles (MAVs) is the power density and efficiency of actuators. Piezoelectric and rotary electromagnetic actuators have been shown to have functional power densities but can require mechanically complex transmissions to create flapping motion. Electromagnetic Linear actuators (ELAs) have unique characteristics, allowing them to be controlled and implemented similarly to muscles but demonstrated much lower efficiency. This study presents configurations of ELA consisting of multiple coils and magnets that have the potential to improve efficiency. The use of lightweight conductors in the form of copper clad aluminium (CCA) is explored as a method to improve power density. A numerical method of optimising the geometry and mass distribution of the magnetic and conductive material is presented. The results show the power consumption of these actuators can range between 910-260 W/kg. The inclusion of an additional magnet and coil can improve efficiency by up to 3.5 times over typical flapping wing ELAs.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/311752/grant-funded-researcher-b-c-2-2-open-ended-tasks/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5056014770", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5080349517", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on ancient DNA and microbiome analysis, which is not directly aligned with the machine learning and augmented reasoning focus of the job description, whereas Candidate B's work on linear electromagnetic actuators and control systems demonstrates a strong technical and engineering background that is more relevant to the interactive machine learning and reasoning tasks described in the job.\n\nPreferred: B\nConfidence score: 100", "created": 1737539510, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 78, "prompt_tokens": 3461, "total_tokens": 3539, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 3397}, "comparison": "Candidate A's research focuses on ancient DNA and microbiome analysis, which is not directly aligned with the machine learning and augmented reasoning focus of the job description, whereas Candidate B's work on linear electromagnetic actuators and control systems demonstrates a strong technical and engineering background that is more relevant to the interactive machine learning and reasoning tasks described in the job.", "preferred": "B", "confidence_score": 100, "passage_rank1": 58, "passage_rank2": 41}

Herein, we use cryogenic vibrational spectroscopy and ion mobility‐mass spectrometry to study the structure of B‐type fragments of protected galactosides. Cationic fragments were generated from glycosyl donors carrying trichloroacetimidate or thioethyl leaving groups of different anomeric configuration. The obtained infrared signatures indicate that the investigated fragments exhibit an identical structure, which suggests that there is no anomeric memory in B‐type ions of fully protected monosaccharides.<sep>Arabinomannan (AM) polysaccharides are clinical biomarkers for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections due to their roles in the interaction with host cells and interference with macrophage activation. Collections of defined AM oligosaccharides can help to improve the understanding of these polysaccharides and the development of novel therapeutical and diagnostic agents. Automated glycan assembly (AGA) was employed to prepare the core structure of AM from MTB, containing α-(1,6)-Man, α-(1,5)-Ara, and α-(1,2)-Man linkages. The introduction of a capping step after each glycosylation and further optimized reaction conditions allowed for the synthesis of a series of oligosaccharides, ranging from hexa- to branched dodecasaccharides.<sep>Polysaccharides are the most abundant biopolymers on earth that serve various structural and modulatory functions. Pure, completely defined linear and branched polysaccharides are essential to understand carbohydrate structure and function. Polysaccharide isolation provides heterogeneous mixtures, while heroic efforts were required to complete chemical and/or enzymatic syntheses of polysaccharides as long 92-mers. Here, we show that automated glycan assembly (AGA) enables access to a 100-mer polysaccharide via a 201-step synthesis within 188 h. Convergent block coupling of 30- and 31-mer oligosaccharide fragments, prepared by AGA, yielded a multiple-branched 151-mer polymannoside. Quick access to polysaccharides provides the basis for future material science applications of carbohydrates.<sep>Significance Synthetic macromolecules that mimic glycolipids, named Janus glycodendrimers (JGDs), have been shown to self-assemble into nanoscale vesicles displaying glycans on their outer surface, similar to the glycocalyx coating of eukaryotic cells, bacteria, and viruses. Specifically, both linear and branched oligosaccharides synthesized by automated glycan assembly, with hydrophobic linkers, have been used to create JGDs via an isothiocyanate–amine coupling reaction. Surprisingly, in spite of the hydrophobic linker, these JGDs self-organize into nanovesicles exhibiting lamellar surface morphologies, which mimic the recognition structures of cell-surface glycans and viral glycoproteins. Therefore, they are likely to be useful in helping elucidate mechanisms of significance for translational medicine such as the camouflage functionality employed by viruses to evade recognition.<sep>Automated glycan assembly (AGA) aims at accelerating access to synthetic oligosaccharides to meet the demand for defined glycans as tools for molecular glycobiology. The linkers used to connect the growing glycan chain to the solid support play a pivotal role in the synthesis strategy as they determine all chemical conditions used during the synthesis and the form of the glycan obtained at the end of it. Here, we describe a traceless photolabile linker used to prepare carbohydrates with a free reducing end. Modification of the o-nitrobenzyl scaffold of the linker is key to high yields and compatibility with the AGA workflow. The assembly of an asymmetrical biantennary N-glycan from oligosaccharide fragments prepared by AGA and linear as well as branched β-oligoglucans is described to illustrate the power of the method. These substrates will serve as standards and biomarkers to examine the unique specificity of glycosyl hydrolases.<sep>Carbohydrates, such as oligo- and polysaccharides, are highly abundant biopolymers that are involved in numerous processes. The study of their structure and functions is commonly based on a material that is isolated from complex natural sources. However, a more precise analysis requires pure compounds with well-defined structures that can be obtained from chemical or enzymatic syntheses. Novel synthetic strategies have increased the accessibility of larger monodisperse polysaccharides, posing a challenge to the analytical methods used for their molecular characterization. Here, we present wide mass range ultrahigh-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS) as a powerful platform for the analysis of synthetic oligo- and polysaccharides. Synthetic carbohydrates 16-, 64-, 100-, and 151-mers were mass analyzed and characterized by MALDI in-source decay FT-ICR MS. Detection of fragment ions generated from glycosidic bond cleavage (or cross-ring cleavage) provided information of the monosaccharide content and the linkage type, allowing for the corroboration of the carbohydrate compositions and structures.<sep>Microbial glycan degradation is essential to global carbon cycling. The marine bacterium Salegentibacter sp. Hel_I_6 (Bacteroidota) isolated from seawater off Helgoland island (North Sea) contains an α-mannan inducible gene cluster with a GH76 family endo-α-1,6-mannanase (ShGH76). This cluster is related to genetic loci employed by human gut bacteria to digest fungal α-mannan. Metagenomes from the Hel_I_6 isolation site revealed increasing GH76 gene frequencies in free-living bacteria during microalgae blooms, suggesting degradation of α-1,6-mannans from fungi. Recombinant ShGH76 protein activity assays with yeast α-mannan and synthetic oligomannans showed endo-α-1,6-mannanase activity. Resolved structures of apo-ShGH76 (2.0 Å) and of mutants co-crystalized with fungal mannan-mimicking α-1,6-mannotetrose (1.90 Å) and α-1,6-mannotriose (1.47 Å) retained the canonical (α/α)6 fold, despite low identities with sequences of known GH76 structures (GH76s from gut bacteria: <27%). The apo-form active site differed from those known from gut bacteria, and co-crystallizations revealed a kinked oligomannan conformation. Co-crystallizations also revealed precise molecular-scale interactions of ShGH76 with fungal mannan-mimicking oligomannans, indicating adaptation to this particular type of substrate. Our data hence suggest presence of yet unknown fungal α-1,6-mannans in marine ecosystems, in particular during microalgal blooms.<sep>The connection between monosaccharides influences the structure, solubility, and biological function of carbohydrates. Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) often enables the compositional identification of carbohydrates, traditional MS/MS fragmentation methods fail to generate abundant cross-ring fragments of intrachain monosaccharides that could reveal carbohydrate connectivity. We examined the potential of helium-charge transfer dissociation (He-CTD) as a method of MS/MS to decipher the connectivity of β-1,4- and β-1,3-linked oligosaccharides. In contrast to collision-induced dissociation (CID), He-CTD of isolated oligosaccharide precursors produced both glycosidic and cross-ring cleavages of each monosaccharide. The radical-driven dissociation in He-CTD induced single cleavage events, without consecutive fragmentations, which facilitated structural interpretation. He-CTD of various standards up to a degree of polymerization of 7 showed that β-1,4- and β-1,3-linked carbohydrates can be distinguished based on diagnostic 3,5A fragment ions that are characteristic for β-1,4-linkages. Overall, fragment ion spectra from He-CTD contained sufficient information to infer the connectivity specifically for each glycosidic bond. When testing He-CTD to resolve the order of β-1,4- and β-1,3-linkages in mixed-linked oligosaccharide standards, He-CTD spectra sometimes provided less confident assignment of connectivity. Ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry (IMS–MS) of the standards indicated that ambiguity in the He-CTD spectra was caused by isobaric impurities in the mixed-linked oligosaccharides. Radical-driven dissociation induced by He-CTD can thus expand MS/MS to carbohydrate linkage analysis, as demonstrated by the comprehensive fragment ion spectra on native oligosaccharides. The determination of connectivity in true unknowns would benefit from the separation of isobaric precursors, through UPLC or IMS, before linkage determination via He-CTD.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Profiling (computer programming)<sep>Chemical space<sep>Derivatization<sep>Hedgehog<sep>Osteoblast<sep>Mass spectrometry<sep>Plant lipid transfer proteins<sep>Glucose transporter<sep>Autophagy<sep>Agonist<sep>Organelle biogenesis<sep>Autophagosome<sep>Natural product<sep>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor<sep>Cell<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Function (biology)<sep>Small molecule<sep>Glycolysis<sep>DNA<sep>Glucose uptake<sep>Chromatin<sep>Cysteine<sep>Covalent bond<sep>Proteome<sep>Biogenesis<sep>Kojic acid<sep>Organelle<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Gene</keyword><title>Discovery of a σ1 receptor antagonist by combination of unbiased cell painting and thermal proteome profiling<sep>The Highly Potent AhR Agonist Picoberin Modulates Hh-Dependent Osteoblast Differentiation<sep>Synthesis of Indomorphan Pseudo‐Natural Product Inhibitors of Glucose Transporters GLUT‐1 and ‐3<sep>Detection of a Mitochondrial Stress Phenotype using the Cell Painting Assay<sep>Discovery of Covalent Inhibitors Targeting the Transcriptional Enhanced Associate Domain Central Pocket<sep>Encoded, click-reactive DNA-binding domains for programmable capture of specific chromatin segments<sep>The cholesterol transfer protein GRAMD1A regulates autophagosome biogenesis</title><abstract>Phenotypic screening for bioactive small molecules is typically combined with affinity-based chemical proteomics to uncover the respective molecular targets. However, such assays and the explored bioactivity are biased toward the monitored phenotype, and target identification often requires chemical derivatization of the hit compound. In contrast, unbiased cellular profiling approaches record hundreds of parameters upon compound perturbation to map bioactivity in a broader biological context and may link a profile to the molecular target or mode of action. Herein we report the discovery of the diaminopyrimidine DP68 as a Sigma 1 (σ1) receptor antagonist by combining morphological profiling using the Cell Painting assay and thermal proteome profiling. Our results highlight that integration of complementary profiling approaches may enable both detection of bioactivity and target identification for small molecules.<sep>Identification and analysis of small molecule bioactivity in target-agnostic cellular assays and monitoring changes in phenotype followed by identification of the biological target are a powerful approach for the identification of novel bioactive chemical matter in particular when the monitored phenotype is disease-related and physiologically relevant. Profiling methods that enable the unbiased analysis of compound-perturbed states can suggest mechanisms of action or even targets for bioactive small molecules and may yield novel insights into biology. Here we report the enantioselective synthesis of natural-product-inspired 8-oxotetrahydroprotoberberines and the identification of Picoberin, a low picomolar inhibitor of Hedgehog (Hh)-induced osteoblast differentiation. Global transcriptome and proteome profiling revealed the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as the molecular target of this compound and identified a cross talk between Hh and AhR signaling during osteoblast differentiation.<sep>Abstract Bioactive compound design based on natural product (NP) structure may be limited because of partial coverage of NP‐like chemical space and biological target space. These limitations can be overcome by combining NP‐centered strategies with fragment‐based compound design through combination of NP‐derived fragments to afford structurally unprecedented “pseudo‐natural products” (pseudo‐NPs). The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a collection of indomorphan pseudo‐NPs that combine biosynthetically unrelated indole‐ and morphan‐alkaloid fragments are described. Indomorphane derivative Glupin was identified as a potent inhibitor of glucose uptake by selectively targeting and upregulating glucose transporters GLUT‐1 and GLUT‐3. Glupin suppresses glycolysis, reduces the levels of glucose‐derived metabolites, and attenuates the growth of various cancer cell lines. Our findings underscore the importance of dual GLUT‐1 and GLUT‐3 inhibition to efficiently suppress tumor cell growth and the cellular rescue mechanism, which counteracts glucose scarcity.<sep>Abstract Mitochondria are cellular powerhouses and crucial for cell function. However, these organelles are vulnerable to internal and external perturbagens that may impair mitochondrial function and eventually lead to cell death. In particular, small molecules may impact mitochondrial function and cardio- or hepatotoxicity caused by numerous drugs links mitochondrial toxicity to these adverse effects. Therefore, the influence of small molecules on mitochondrial homeostasis is at best assessed early on in the characterization of biologically active small molecules and drug discovery. We demonstrate that unbiased morphological profiling by means of the Cell Painting assay (CPA) can detect mitochondrial stress coupled to the induction of integrated stress response. This activity is common for compounds addressing different targets, is not shared by direct inhibitors of the electron transport chain and enables prediction of mitochondrial stress induction for small molecules that are profiled using CPA.<sep>Transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) transcription factors together with coactivators and corepressors modulate the expression of genes that regulate fundamental processes, such as organogenesis and cell growth, and elevated TEAD activity is associated with tumorigenesis. Hence, novel modulators of TEAD and methods for their identification are in high demand. We describe the development of a new “thiol conjugation assay” for identification of novel small molecules that bind to the TEAD central pocket. The assay monitors prevention of covalent binding of a fluorescence turn-on probe to a cysteine in the central pocket by small molecules. Screening of a collection of compounds revealed kojic acid analogues as TEAD inhibitors, which covalently target the cysteine in the central pocket, block the interaction with coactivator yes-associated protein with nanomolar apparent IC50 values, and reduce TEAD target gene expression. This methodology promises to enable new medicinal chemistry programs aimed at the modulation of TEAD activity.<sep>Enrichment of chromatin segments from specific genomic loci of living cells is an important goal in chromatin biology, since it enables establishing local molecular compositions as the basis of locus function. A central enrichment strategy relies on the expression of DNA-binding domains that selectively interact with a local target sequence followed by fixation and isolation of the associated chromatin segment. The efficiency and selectivity of this approach critically depend on the employed enrichment tag and the strategy used for its introduction into the DNA-binding domain or close-by proteins. We here report chromatin enrichment by expressing programmable transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) bearing single strained alkynes or alkenes introduced via genetic code expansion. This enables in situ biotinylation at a defined TALE site via strain-promoted inverse electron demand Diels Alder cycloadditions for single-step, high affinity enrichment. By targeting human pericentromeric SATIII repeats, the origin of nuclear stress bodies, we demonstrate enrichment of SATIII DNA and SATIII-associated proteins, and identify factors enriched during heat stress.<sep>Autophagy mediates the degradation of damaged proteins, organelles and pathogens, and plays a key role in health and disease. Thus, the identification of new mechanisms involved in the regulation of autophagy is of major interest. In particular, little is known about the role of lipids and lipid-binding proteins in the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis. Using target-agnostic, high-content, image-based identification of indicative phenotypic changes induced by small molecules, we have identified autogramins as a new class of autophagy inhibitor. Autogramins selectively target the recently discovered cholesterol transfer protein GRAM domain-containing protein 1A (GRAMD1A, which had not previously been implicated in autophagy), and directly compete with cholesterol binding to the GRAMD1A StART domain. GRAMD1A accumulates at sites of autophagosome initiation, affects cholesterol distribution in response to starvation and is required for autophagosome biogenesis. These findings identify a new biological function of GRAMD1A and a new role for cholesterol in autophagy. The cholesterol-transfer protein GRAMD1A is identified as the target of the autophagy inhibitors autogramin-1 and autogramin-2. GRAMD1A is found to be required for autophagosome biogenesis.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/502968", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5060252075", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5076704252", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A has a strong background in glycobiology and mass spectrometry, which aligns well with the required expertise in mass spectrometry-based proteomics and protein homeostasis.

The gold standard is a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based system taking several hours to confirm positivity. For effective public health containment measures, this time span is too long. We therefore evaluated a rapid test in a high-prevalence community setting.Thirty-nine randomly selected individuals at a COVID-19 screening centre were simultaneously tested via qPCR and a rapid test. Ten previously diagnosed individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 infection were also analysed.The evaluated rapid test is an IgG/IgM-based test for SARS-CoV-2 with a time to result of 20 min. Two drops of blood are needed for the test performance.Of 49 individuals, 22 tested positive by repeated qPCR. In contrast, the rapid test detected only eight of those positive correctly (sensitivity: 36.4%). Of the 27 qPCR-negative individuals, 24 were detected correctly (specificity: 88.9%).Given the low sensitivity, we recommend not to<sep>Summary The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already caused devastating losses. Exponential spread can be slowed by social distancing and population-wide isolation measures, but those place a tremendous burden on society, and, once lifted, exponential spread can re-emerge. Regular population-scale testing, combined with contact tracing and case isolation, should help break the cycle of transmission, but current detection strategies are not capable of such large-scale processing. Here we present a protocol for LAMP-Seq, a barcoded Reverse-Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) method that is highly scalable. Individual samples are stabilized, inactivated, and amplified in three isothermal heat steps, generating barcoded amplicons that can be pooled and analyzed en masse by sequencing. Using unique barcode combinations per sample from a compressed barcode space enables extensive pooling, potentially further reducing cost and simplifying logistics. We validated LAMP-Seq on 28 clinical samples, empirically optimized the protocol and barcode design, and performed initial safety evaluation. Relying on world-wide infrastructure<sep>The presence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 correlates with protection against infection and severe COVID-19 disease courses. Understanding the dynamics of antibody development against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is important for recommendations on vaccination strategies and on control of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates the dynamics and extent of α-Spike-Ab development by different vaccines manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. On day 1 after vaccination, we observed a temporal low-grade inflammatory response. α-Spike-Ab titers were reduced after six months of vaccination with mRNA vaccines and increased 14 days after booster vaccinations to a maximum that exceeded titers from mild and critical COVID-19 and Long-COVID patients. Within the group of critical COVID-19 patients, we observed a trend for lower α-Spike-Ab titers in the group of patients who survived COVID-19. This trend accompanied higher numbers of pro-B cells, fewer mature B cells and a higher frequency of T follicular helper cells. Finally,<sep>Bacterial infections have been treated effectively by antibiotics since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. A worldwide increase in the use of antibiotics led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains in almost all bacterial pathogens, which complicates the treatment of infectious diseases. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria play an important role in increasing the risk associated with the usage of surface waters (e.g., irrigation, recreation) and the spread of the resistance genes. Many studies show that important pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria can enter the environment by the discharge of sewage treatment plants and combined sewage overflow events. Mussels have successfully been used as bio-indicators of heavy metals, chemicals and parasites; they may also be efficient bio-indicators for viruses and bacteria. In this study an influence of the discharge of a sewage treatment plant could be shown in regard to the presence of E. coli in higher concentrations in the mussels downstream the treatment plant. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria,<sep>Slaughterhouse wastewater is considered a reservoir for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic residues, which are not sufficiently removed by conventional treatment processes. This study focuses on the occurrence of ESKAPE bacteria (Enterococcus spp., S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.), ESBL (extended-spectrum β-lactamase)-producing E. coli, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic residues in wastewater from a poultry slaughterhouse. The efficacy of conventional and advanced treatments (i.e., ozonation) of the in-house wastewater treatment plant regarding their removal was also evaluated. Target culturable bacteria were detected only in the influent and effluent after conventional treatment. High abundances of genes (e.g., blaTEM, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-32, blaOXA-48, blaCMY and mcr-1) of up to 1.48 × 106 copies/100 mL were detected in raw influent. All of them were already significantly reduced by 1-4.2 log units after conventional treatment. Following ozonation, mcr-1 and blaCTX-M-32 were further reduced below the limit of detection. Antibiotic residues were detected in 55.6%<sep>Staphylococcus aureus is a facultative pathogen that can encode numerous antibiotic resistance and immune evasion genes and can cause severe infections. Reduced susceptibility to last resort antibiotics such as vancomycin and daptomycin is often associated with mutations in walRK, an essential two-component regulatory system (TCS). This study focuses on the WalK accessory membrane proteins YycH and YycI and their influence on WalRK phosphorylation. Depletion of YycH and YycI by antisense RNA caused an impaired autolysis, indicating a positive regulatory function on WalK as has been previously described. Phosphorylation assays with full-length recombinant proteins in phospholipid liposomes showed that YycH and YycI stimulate WalK activity and that both regulatory proteins are needed for full activation of the WalK kinase. This was validated in vivo through examining the phosphorylation status of WalR using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE with a yycHI deletion mutant exhibiting reduced levels of phosphorylated WalR. In the yycHI knockdown strain, muropeptide composition of the<sep>The role of environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether viral contamination of air, wastewater, and surfaces in quarantined households result in a higher risk for exposed persons. For this study, a source population of 21 households under quarantine conditions with at least one person who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were randomly selected from a community in North Rhine-Westphalia in March 2020. All individuals living in these households participated in this study and provided throat swabs for analysis. Air and wastewater samples and surface swabs were obtained from each household and analysed using qRT-PCR. Positive swabs were further cultured to analyse for viral infectivity. Out of all the 43 tested adults, 26 (60.47%) tested positive using qRT-PCR. All 15 air samples were qRT-PCR-negative. In total, 10 out of 66 wastewater samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (15.15%) and 4 out of 119 surface samples<sep>Infections with antibiotic resistant pathogens threaten lives and cause substantial costs. For effective interventions, knowledge of the transmission paths of resistant bacteria to humans is essential. In this study, carbapenem resistant bacteria were isolated from the wastewater of a maximum care hospital during a period of two years, starting in the patient rooms and following the sewer system to the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The bacteria belonged to six different species and 44 different sequence types (STs). The most frequent STs, ST147 K. pneumoniae (blaNDM/blaOXA-48) and ST235 P. aeruginosa (blaVIM) strains, were present at nearly all sampling sites from the hospital to the WWTP effluent. After core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST), all ST147 K. pneumoniae strains presented a single epidemiological cluster. In contrast, ST235 P. aeruginosa formed five cgMLST clusters and the largest cluster contained the strain from the WWTP effluent, indicating without doubt, a direct dissemination of both<sep>The high use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to a wide spread of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance into the environment. In recent years, various studies have shown that antibiotic residues, resistant bacteria and resistance genes, occur in aquatic environments and that clinical wastewater seems to be a hot spot for the environmental spread of antibiotic resistance. Here a representative statistical analysis of various sampling points is presented, containing different proportions of clinically influenced wastewater. The statistical analysis contains the calculation of the odds ratios for any combination of antibiotics with resistant bacteria or resistance genes, respectively. The results were screened for an increased probability of detecting resistant bacteria, or resistance genes, with the simultaneous presence of antibiotic residues. Positive associated sets were then compared, with regards to the detected median concentration, at the investigated sampling points. All results show that the sampling points with the highest proportion of clinical<sep>Increasing isolation rates of resistant bacteria in the last years require identification of potential infection reservoirs in healthcare facilities. Especially the clinical wastewater network represents a potential source of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In this work, the siphons of the sanitary installations from 18 hospital rooms of two German hospitals were examined for antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic residues including siphons of showers and washbasins and toilets in sanitary units of psychosomatic, haemato-oncological, and rehabilitation wards. In addition, in seven rooms of the haemato-oncological ward, the effect of 24 h of stagnation on the antibiotic concentrations and MDR (multi-drug-resistant) bacteria in biofilms was evaluated. Whereas no antibiotic residues were found in the psychosomatic ward, potential selective concentrations of piperacillin, meropenem and ciprofloxacin were detected at a rehabilitation ward and ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were present at a haemato-oncology ward. Antibiotic resistant bacteria were isolated from the siphons of all wards, however in the psychosomatic ward,<sep>Escherichia coli is frequently associated with multiple antimicrobial resistances and a major cause of bacterial extraintestinal infections in livestock and humans. However, data on the epidemiology of (i) multidrug-resistant (MDR) and (ii) extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) in poultry and pig slaughterhouses in Germany is currently lacking. Selected E. coli isolates (n = 71) with phenotypic resistance to cephalosporins from two poultry and two pig slaughterhouses expressing high MDR rates (combined resistance to piperacillin, cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin) of 51.4% and 58.3%, respectively, were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. They constituted a reservoir for 53 different antimicrobial resistance determinants and were assigned various sequence types, including high-risk clones involved in human infections worldwide. An ExPEC pathotype was detected in 17.1% and 5.6% of the isolates from poultry and pig slaughterhouses, respectively. Worryingly, they were recovered from scalding water and eviscerators, indicating an increased risk for cross-contaminations. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) were detected in<sep>Hospitals with their high antimicrobial selection pressure represent the presumably most important reservoir of multidrug-resistant human pathogens. Antibiotics administered in the course of treatment are excreted and discharged into the wastewater system. Not only in patients, but also in the sewers, antimicrobial substances exert selection pressure on existing bacteria and promote the emergence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant clones. In previous studies, two main clusters were identified in all sections of the hospital wastewater network that was investigated, one K. pneumoniae ST147 cluster encoding NDM- and OXA-48 carbapenemases and one VIM-encoding P. aeruginosa ST823 cluster. In the current study, we investigated if NDM- and OXA-48-encoding K. pneumoniae and VIM-encoding P. aeruginosa isolates recovered between 2014 and 2021 from oncological patients belonged to those same clusters.The 32 isolates were re-cultured, whole-genome sequenced, phenotypically tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility, and analyzed for clonality and resistance genes in silico.Among these strains, 25 belonged to the two clusters<sep>Due to the high prevalence of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in poultry and pigs, process waters and wastewater from slaughterhouses were considered as a hotspot for isolates carrying plasmid-encoded, mobilizable colistin resistances (mcr genes). Thus, questions on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment in in-house and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as on the diversity of the prevailing isolates, plasmid types, and their transmissibility arise. Process waters and wastewater accruing in the delivery and unclean areas of two poultry and two pig slaughterhouses were screened for the presence of target colistin-resistant bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae complex). In-house and municipal WWTPs (mWWTPs) including receiving waterbodies were investigated as well. Samples taken in the poultry slaughterhouses yielded the highest occurrence of target colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (40.2%, 33/82), followed by mWWTPs (25.0%, 9/36) and pig slaughterhouses (14.9%, 10/67). Recovered isolates exhibited various resistance patterns. The resistance rates using epidemiological cut-off values were higher in<sep>Antibiotic resistance (ABR) and the spread of multidrug-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli via wastewater to environmental compartments are of rapidly growing global health concern. Health care facilities, industries and slaughterhouses discharge high loads of ABR bacteria with their wastewater. However, the general community is often the biggest indirect discharger. Yet, research focusing explicitly on this important diffuse source is rather scarce raising questions about variations in the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in wastewater from different communities and over time. Between April 2019 and March 2020, wastewater from three socio-spatially different districts in the Ruhr Metropolis, Germany, and the receiving wastewater treatment plant was sampled monthly and analysed for the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli via culture-based methods. Isolates were validated with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and antibiotic resistance profiles were analysed via microdilution.

Unique in this regard, and a topic that has only recently come into focus, is the microbiome of hospitals. While the benefits of knowing exactly which microorganisms propagate how and where in hospitals are undoubtedly beneficial for preventing hospital-acquired infections, there are, to date, no standardized procedures on how to best study the hospital microbiome. Our study aimed to investigate the microbiome of hospital sanitary facilities, outlining the extent to which hospital microbiome analyses differ according to sample-preparation protocol. For this purpose, fifty samples were collected from two separate hospitals-from three wards and one hospital laboratory-using two different storage media from which DNA was extracted using two different extraction kits and sequenced with two different primer pairs (V1-V2 and V3-V4). There were no observable differences between the sample-preservation media, small differences in detected taxa between the DNA<sep>Multidrug-resistant bacteria cause difficult-to-treat infections and pose a risk for modern medicine. Sources of multidrug-resistant bacteria include hospital, municipal and slaughterhouse wastewaters. In this study, bacteria with resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins were isolated from all three wastewater biotopes, including a maximum care hospital, municipal wastewaters collected separately from a city and small rural towns and the wastewaters of two pig and two poultry slaughterhouses. The resistance profiles of all isolates against clinically relevant antibiotics (including β-lactams like carbapenems, the quinolone ciprofloxacin, colistin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) were determined at the same laboratory. The bacteria were classified according to their risk to human health using clinical criteria, with an emphasis on producers of carbapenemases, since carbapenems are prescribed for hospitalized patients with infections with multi-drug resistant bacteria. The results showed that bacteria that pose the highest risk, i. e., bacteria resistant to all β-lactams including carbapenems and ciprofloxacin, were mainly disseminated by hospitals and were<sep>The emergence of antibiotic-resistant clinically relevant facultative pathogenic bacteria in the environment has become one of the most important global health challenges. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) have been found in surface waters and wastewater treatment plants. Drinking water guidelines and the EU bathing water directive 2006/7/EC include the surveillance of defined microbiological parameters on species level, while the monitoring of ARB is missing in all existing guidelines. However, standardized methods for the detection of ARB exist for clinical investigations of human materials only. They are based on cultivation on selective agar plates. These methods cannot be used directly for environmental samples, because of the high amount and diversity of bacterial background flora which interferes with the detection of human-relevant ARB. The aim of this study was to introduce a proposal for future normative standard operation procedures, with international relevance, for the culture-based detection of clinically-relevant antibiotic resistant bacteria in aquatic environmental samples like wastewater<sep>Slaughterhouse process- and wastewater are considered as a hotspot for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antimicrobial residues and may thus play an important role for their dissemination into the environment. In this study, we investigated occurrence and characteristics of ESKAPE bacteria (E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) and ESBL (extended spectrum β-lactamase) -producing E. coli in water samples of different processing stages of two German pig slaughterhouses (S1/S2) as well as their municipal wastewater treatment plants (mWWTPs). Furthermore, residues of various antimicrobials were determined. A total of 103 water samples were taken in delivery and dirty areas of the slaughterhouses S1/S2 (n = 37), their in-house WWTPs (n = 30) and mWWTPs including their receiving water bodies (n = 36). The recovered isolates (n = 886) were characterized for their antimicrobial resistance pattern and its genetic basis. Targeted species were ubiquitous along the slaughtering and wastewater chains. Phenotypic and<sep>Abstract Antibiotic resistance (ABR) and the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) via wastewater are of global health concern. Simultaneously, wastewater-based surveillance is a promising approach to gain an overview of the local ABR situation providing complementary public health data at lower costs. Research on the general community as one of the biggest dischargers is rather scarce. The objective of this study was to explore spatial and temporal differences in the occurrence of MDRO in community wastewater from socio-spatially different districts. Wastewater from three socio-spatially different districts in the Ruhr Metropolis, Germany, was sampled monthly over a year and analysed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli via culture-based methods. Isolates were validated with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Antibiotic resistance profiles were analysed via microdilution. Phenotypic ESBL-producing E. coli could be isolated from every wastewater sample. The socio-spatially disadvantaged area displayed higher ESBL-producing E. coli loads adjusted for domestic<sep>Between August 2018 and June 2019, a river system in Germany that supplies a drinking water reservoir and is subject to the discharge from two sewage treatment plants was monitored for antibiotic residues via liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, antibiotic resistance genes (including blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, blaKPC, blaGIM, blaSME, blaIMI, blaIMP, blaSPM, blaSIM, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-51, blaOXA-58, mcr) via qualitative real-time PCR and antibiotic-resistant bacteria [belonging to the ESKAPE-group (Enterococcus faecium, Staphyhlococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter ssp.; with resistance against Carbapenemases, Cephalosporines and Colistin) and Escherichia coli] based on cultivation methods followed by a characterization via MALDI-TOF MS and susceptibility testing applying microdilution. Residues of macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin (up to 0.60 μg/L) and residues of sulfamethoxazole (up to 0.40 μg/L) and trimethoprim (up to 0.39 μg/L) were detected downstream of the sewage treatment plants. In addition, no antibiotic residues were detected upstream the respective sewage treatment plants,<sep>On a commercial broiler farm with substantial health problems, shown by a reported loss rate of approx. 10% and regular antibiotic use, samples were taken at different locations in 2 barns, with the aim of analyzing possible entry routes and persistence of pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as revealing weak points in sanitation. Therefore, swab samples for biofilm and water samples from animal drinking water lines and the spray cooling system were taken twice immediately before restocking. In addition, swab samples from drain holes and air samples were collected. At restocking, hatchlings that died during transportation and chick paper were sampled. All samples were analyzed for the occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, total coliform count, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, namely, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). No MRSA or VRE were detectable. In all samples from drinking water and sprinkler<sep>The wastewater of livestock slaughterhouses is considered a source of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria with clinical relevance and may thus be important for their dissemination into the environment. To get an overview of their occurrence and characteristics, we investigated process water (n = 50) from delivery and unclean areas as well as wastewater (n = 32) from the in-house wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of two German poultry slaughterhouses (slaughterhouses S1 and S2). The samples were screened for ESKAPE bacteria (Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) and Escherichia coli Their antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and the presence of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase, and mobilizable colistin resistance genes were determined. Selected ESKAPE bacteria were epidemiologically classified using different molecular typing techniques. At least one of the target species was detected in 87.5% (n = 28/32) of the wastewater samples and 86.0% (n = 43/50) of the process water samples.

This study assessed whether altered functional connectivity within and between these networks contributes to such excessive concerns in adolescents with BN early the course of the disorder. Full-Text PDF<sep>Research has shown that rumination and negative affect are elevated in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), but the underlying origins remain unclear. Drawing from the theoretical framework of the Goal Progress Theory of rumination, we propose that heightened feelings of \"inefficiency\" (i.e., low self-efficacy) in AN might play an important role in these dysfunctional cognitive-affective processes.Thirty-two weight-recovered participants with a history of AN and 32 healthy control participants filled out questionnaires regarding rumination and affect six times a day over a period of 2 weeks via ecological momentary assessment in real-life.Analyses via hierarchical as well as conceptual process modeling suggest that while inefficiency is generally associated with more rumination and negative affect, additional amplifying mechanisms between these variables exist specifically in recovered participants with a history of AN.Inefficiency as a core aspect of AN appears to trigger dysfunctional cognitive-affective processes which may contribute to vulnerability for AN.<sep>Strict eating routines and frequent rigid behavior patterns are commonly observed in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). A recent theory proposes that while these behaviors may have been reinforced initially, they later become habitual. To date, however, research has been overly focused on eating-disorder (ED)-related habits. Over the course of seven days, we applied an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to investigate the habit frequency and strength of ED-specific (food intake) and ED-unspecific (hygiene) habits in the daily lives of a sample of n = 57 AN and n = 57 healthy controls (HC). The results of the hierarchical models revealed that habits were significantly more likely in patients compared with HC for both categories, independently. Furthermore, a lower body mass index (BMI) was associated with increased habit frequency in AN. Our study strengthens the habit theory of AN by showing the relevance of habits beyond ED-specific behavioral domains. This also supports the development of innovative therapeutic interventions targeting habitual behavior in EDs.<sep>Excessive weight and obesity, especially with childhood onset, is associated with long-term morbidity and mortality and places a major burden on the health care system. In the United States, 17% of children and adolescents are obese (32% overweight). By adulthood, the number rises to 34% or even 68% when also considering overweight individuals.1 Conventional nonsurgical treatments are often ineffective, and weight loss achieved with behaviorally oriented therapy programs is usually small (∼5%) and short-lived.2 A better understanding of the associated psychological mechanisms and their neurobiological underpinnings may allow for the development of more efficient, potentially brain-based, therapeutic interventions. A growing number of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies point to alterations in reward-related corticostriatal circuity and the hypothalamus, a key area in energy homeostasis.3 Recent studies have analyzed resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), a technique sensitive to changes in the interaction between distant brain regions, which is particularly advantageous in clinical samples, as it requires little compliance and as scanning time is relatively short.<sep>Abstract Previous studies have proposed that altered reward processing and elevated cognitive control underlie the etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). A newly debated notion suggests altered habit learning and an overreliance on habits may contribute to the persistence of AN. In weight-recovered AN patients, we previously found neuroimaging-based evidence for unaltered reward processing, but elevated cognitive control. In order to differentiate between state versus trait factors, we here contrast the aforementioned hypotheses in a sample of acutely underweight AN (acAN) patients. 37 acAN patients and 37 closely matched healthy controls (HC) underwent a functional MRI while performing an established instrumental motivation task. We found no group differences with respect to neural responses during the anticipation or receipt of reward. However, the behavioral response data showed a bimodal distribution, indicative for a goal-directed (gAN) and a habit-driven (hAN) patient subgroup. Additional analyses revealed decreased mOFC activation during reward anticipation in hAN, which would be in line with a habit-driven response. These findings provide a new perspective on the debate regarding the notion of increased goal-directed versus habitual behavior in AN. If replicable, the observed dissociation between gAN and hAN might help to tailor therapeutic approaches to individual patient characteristics.<sep>Abstract Background Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified functional connectivity patterns associated with acute undernutrition in anorexia nervosa (AN), but few have investigated recovered patients. Thus, a trait connectivity profile characteristic of the disorder remains elusive. Using state-of-the-art graph–theoretic methods in acute AN, the authors previously found abnormal global brain network architecture, possibly driven by local network alterations. To disentangle trait from starvation effects, the present study examines network organization in recovered patients. Methods Graph–theoretic metrics were used to assess resting-state network properties in a large sample of female patients recovered from AN (recAN, n = 55) compared with pairwise age-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 55). Results Indicative of an altered global network structure, recAN showed increased assortativity and reduced global clustering as well as small-worldness compared with HC, while no group differences at an intermediate or local network level were evident. However, using support-vector classifier on local metrics, recAN and HC could be separated with an accuracy of 70.4%. Conclusions This pattern of results suggests that long-term recovered patients have an aberrant global brain network configuration, similar to acutely underweight patients. While the finding of increased assortativity may represent a trait marker of AN, the remaining findings could be<sep>Genetics and biology may influence the age of onset of anorexia nervosa (AN). The aims of this study were to determine whether common genetic variation contributes to age of onset of AN and to investigate the genetic associations between age of onset of AN and age at menarche.A secondary analysis of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AN was performed, which included 9335 cases and 31,981 screened controls, all from European ancestries. We conducted GWASs of age of onset, early-onset AN (<13 years), and typical-onset AN, and genetic correlation, genetic risk score, and Mendelian randomization analyses.Two loci were genome-wide significant in the typical-onset AN GWAS. Heritability estimates (single nucleotide polymorphism-h2) were 0.01-0.04 for age of onset, 0.16-0.25 for early-onset AN, and 0.17-0.25 for typical-onset AN. Early- and typical-onset AN showed distinct genetic correlation patterns with putative risk factors for AN. Specifically, early-onset AN was significantly genetically correlated with younger age at menarche, and typical-onset AN was significantly negatively genetically correlated with anthropometric traits. Genetic risk scores for age of onset and early-onset AN estimated from independent GWASs significantly predicted age of onset. Mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal link between younger age at menarche and early-onset AN.Our results provide evidence consistent<sep>Abstract Background The serotonin (5-HT) hypothesis of anorexia nervosa (AN) posits that individuals predisposed toward or recovered from AN (recAN) have a central nervous hyperserotonergic state and therefore restrict food intake as a means to reduce 5-HT availability (via diminished tryptophan-derived precursor supply) and alleviate associated negative mood states. Importantly, the 5-HT system has also been generally implicated in reward processing, which has also been shown to be altered in AN. Methods In this double-blind crossover study, 22 individuals recAN and 25 healthy control participants (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an established instrumental reward learning paradigm during acute tryptophan depletion (ATD; a dietary intervention that lowers central nervous 5-HT availability) as well as a sham depletion. Results On a behavioral level, the main effects of reward and ATD were evident, but no group differences were found. fMRI analyses revealed a group × ATD × reward level interaction in the ventral anterior insula during reward anticipation as well as in the medial orbitofrontal cortex during reward consumption. Discussion The precise pattern of results is suggestive of a ‘normalization’ of reward-related neural responses during ATD in recAN compared to HC. Our results lend further evidence to the 5-HT hypothesis of AN. Decreasing<sep>Abstract Purpose The gut–brain axis could be a possible key factor in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa. The neuropeptide peptide YY 3–36 , secreted by endocrine L cells of the gastrointestinal tract, is a known regulator of appetite and food intake. The objective of this study was to investigate peptide YY 3–36 plasma concentrations at different stages of anorexia nervosa in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal design to differentiate between effects of acute undernutrition and more enduring characteristics. Methods We measured fasting plasma peptide YY 3–36 concentrations in young patients with acute anorexia nervosa ( n = 47) and long-term recovered patients ( n = 35) cross-sectionally in comparison to healthy control participants ( n = 58), and longitudinally over the course of inpatient treatment. Physical activity was controlled as it may modulate peptide YY secretion. Results There was no group difference in peptide YY 3–36 concentration among young acutely underweight anorexia nervosa patients, long-term recovered anorexia nervosa patients, and healthy control participants. Longitudinally, there was no change in peptide YY 3–36 concentration after short-term weight rehabilitation. For acute anorexia nervosa patients at admission to treatment, there was a negative correlation between peptide YY 3–36 concentration and body mass index. Conclusions The current study<sep>Epigenetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been shown to modulate the functioning of brain circuitry associated with the salience network and may heighten the risk for mental illness. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to test this epigenome–brain–behaviour pathway in patients with anorexia nervosa.We obtained resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data and blood samples from 55 acutely underweight female patients with anorexia nervosa and 55 age-matched female healthy controls. We decomposed imaging data using independent component analysis. We used bisulfite pyrosequencing to analyze blood DNA methylation within the promoter region of SLC6A4. We then explored salience network rsFC patterns in the group × methylation interaction.We identified a positive relationship between SLC6A4 methylation levels and rsFC between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the salience network in patients with anorexia nervosa compared to healthy controls. Increased rsFC in the salience network mediated the link between SLC6A4 methylation and eating disorder symptoms in patients with anorexia nervosa. We confirmed findings of rsFC alterations for CpG-specific methylation at a locus with evidence of methylation correspondence between brain and blood tissue.This study was cross-sectional in nature, the sample size was modest for the method and methylation levels were measured peripherally, so findings cannot be fully<sep>Previous studies have suggested that individuals recovered from anorexia nervosa (AN) are characterized by increased serotonergic (5-HT) activity that might be related to elevated levels of anxiety. Assuming these traits to be also present in individuals at risk for AN, it was further hypothesized that restricting food intake might be a means to temporarily alleviate dysphoric affective states by reducing central nervous availability of tryptophan (TRP), the sole precursor of 5-HT. One study that supported this hypothesis found anxiolytic effects in individuals with a history of AN during an experimentally induced short-term depletion of TRP supply to the brain.In this placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study, 22 patients weight-recovered from AN (recAN) and 25 healthy control participants (HC) completed questionnaires assessing anxiety and momentary mood during acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), a dietary intervention that lowers central 5-HT synthesis.The ATD procedure effectively reduced the ratio of TRP to competing for large neutral amino acids in the peripheral blood, indicating decreased TRP supply to the brain. Effects of ATD on anxiety and mood did not differ between recAN and HC. Bayesian null hypothesis testing confirmed these initial results.Our results do not support the hypothesis that short-term depletion of TRP and its impact on the brain 5-HT reduces anxiety<sep>Anorexia nervosa (AN) has been associated with altered reward processing. We recently reported greater neural response in secondary visual areas when processing visual food stimuli in acutely underweight AN patients (acAN). In order to examine whether the observed alterations are indicative of acute undernutrition or a potential trait marker of AN, we set out to assess neural responses in acAN and in individuals weight-recovered from AN (recAN). FMRI data were collected from a total of 126 female volunteers, 35 acAN, 33 recAN, and 58 age-matched healthy controls (HC) while they viewed streams of food, social and neutral stimuli. A standard general linear model (GLM) was used to interrogate neural responses to the different stimuli in recAN vs. age-matched HC. Moreover, within-subject multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA) in the two matched samples (acAN/HC and recAN/HC) were used to estimate neural representation of food vs. neutral, and social vs. neutral stimuli. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to test associations between the accuracy of the neural representation and treatment outcome. The GLM revealed no group differences between recAN and HC. The MVPAs showed greater classification accuracy of food stimuli in the posterior fusiform gyrus in acAN but not recAN. Classification accuracy was associated with better treatment outcome.<sep>Abstract The acute state of anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with widespread reductions in cortical gray matter (GM) thickness and white matter (WM) volume, suspected changes in myelin content and elevated levels of the neuronal damage marker neurofilament light (NF-L), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. To gain a deeper understanding of brain changes in AN, we applied a multimodal approach combining advanced neuroimaging methods with analysis of blood-derived biomarkers. In addition to standard measures of cortical GM thickness and WM volume, we analyzed tissue-specific profiles of brain metabolites using multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, T1 relaxation time as a proxy of myelin content leveraging advanced quantitative MRI methods and serum NF-L concentrations in a sample of 30 female, predominately adolescent patients with AN and 30 age-matched female healthy control participants. In patients with AN, we found a reduction in GM cortical thickness and GM total N-acetyl aspartate. The latter predicted higher NF-L levels, which were elevated in AN. Furthermore, GM total choline was elevated. In WM, there were no group differences in either imaging markers, choline levels or N-acetyl aspartate levels. The current study provides evidence for neuronal damage processes as well as for increased membrane lipid catabolism and turnover in GM<sep>Abstract Eating disorders and substance use disorders frequently co-occur. Twin studies reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa (BN) and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [ r g ], twin-based=0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge-eating, AN without binge-eating, and a BN factor score), and eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Total sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2,400 to ~537,000 individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder and substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN ( r g =0.18; false discovery rate q =0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN ( r g =0.23; q &lt;0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge-eating ( r g =0.27; q =0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic correlations were<sep>Abstract Background Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by sizable, widespread gray matter (GM) reductions in the acutely underweight state. However, evidence for persistent alterations after weight-restoration has been surprisingly scarce despite high relapse rates, frequent transitions to other psychiatric disorders, and generally unfavorable outcome. While most studies investigated brain regions separately (univariate analysis), psychiatric disorders can be conceptualized as brain network disorders characterized by multivariate alterations with only subtle local effects. We tested for persistent multivariate structural brain alterations in weight-restored individuals with a history of AN, investigated their putative biological substrate and relation with 1-year treatment outcome. Methods We trained machine learning models on regional GM measures to classify healthy controls (HC) ( N = 289) from individuals at three stages of AN: underweight patients starting intensive treatment ( N = 165, used as baseline), patients after partial weight-restoration ( N = 115), and former patients after stable and full weight-restoration ( N = 89). Alterations after weight-restoration were related to treatment outcome and characterized both anatomically and functionally. Results Patients could be classified from HC when underweight (ROC-AUC = 0.90) but also after partial weight-restoration (ROC-AUC = 0.64). Alterations after partial weight-restoration were more pronounced in patients with worse outcome and were<sep>Eating disorders and substance use disorders frequently co-occur. Twin studies reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [rg ], twin-based = 0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge eating, AN without binge eating, and a bulimia nervosa factor score), and eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Total study sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2400 to ~537 000 individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN (rg = 0.18; false discovery rate q = 0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN (rg = 0.23; q < 0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge eating (rg = 0.27; q = 0.0016). Conversely,<sep>It has been suggested that individuals predisposed to or recovered from anorexia nervosa experience a hyperserotonergic state associated with anxiety that might be mitigated by restricted food intake, because diminished levels of the tryptophan precursor lower the central availability of serotonin (5-HT). At the neural level, the salience network is a system of functionally connected brain regions; it has been closely associated with 5-HT functioning and mental disorders (including anorexia nervosa). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect on the salience network of a temporary dietary manipulation of 5-HT synthesis in patients with anorexia nervosa.In this double-blind crossover study, we obtained data on resting-state functional connectivity from 22 weight-recovered female patients with a history of anorexia nervosa, and 22 age-matched female healthy controls. The study procedure included acute tryptophan depletion (a dietary intervention that lowers the central 5-HT synthesis rate) and a sham condition.We identified an interaction of group and experimental condition in resting-state functional connectivity between the salience network and the orbitofrontal cortex extending to the frontal pole (F1,42 = 12.52; pFWE = 0.026). Further analysis revealed increased resting-state functional connectivity during acute tryptophan depletion in patients recovered from anorexia nervosa, resembling that of healthy controls during the sham<sep><h3>Background:</h3> Patients with anorexia nervosa forgo eating despite emaciation and severe health consequences. Such dysfunctional decision-making might be explained by an excessive level of self-control, alterations in homeostatic and hedonic regulation, or an interplay between these processes. We aimed to understand value-based decision-making in anorexia nervosa and its association with the gut hormone ghrelin. Besides its homeostatic function, ghrelin has been implicated in the hedonic regulation of appetite and reward via the modulation of phasic dopamine signalling. <h3>Methods:</h3> In a cross-sectional design, we studied acutely underweight (<i>n</i> = 94) and recovered (<i>n</i> = 37) patients with anorexia nervosa of the restrictive subtype, as well as healthy control participants (<i>n</i> = 119). We assessed plasma concentrations of desacyl ghrelin and parameters of delay discounting, probability discounting for gains and losses, and loss aversion. <h3>Results:</h3> Recovered patients displayed higher risk aversion for gains, but we observed no group differences for the remaining decision-making parameters. Desacyl ghrelin was higher in acutely underweight and recovered participants with anorexia nervosa relative to healthy controls. Moreover, we found a significant group × desacyl ghrelin interaction in delay discounting, indicating that in contrast to healthy controls, acutely underweight patients with anorexia nervosa who had high desacyl ghrelin concentrations preferably chose the<sep>Objective Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have repeatedly shown alterations in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). These alterations might be driven by baseline signal characteristics such as the (fractional) amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF/ALFF), as well as regional signal consistency (ie, regional homogeneity [ReHo]) within circumscribed brain regions. Previous studies have also demonstrated gray matter (pseudo-) atrophy in underweight individuals with AN. Here we study fALFF/ALFF and ReHo in predominantly adolescent patients with AN, while taking gray matter changes into consideration. Method Resting state fMRI data were acquired from a sample of 148 female volunteers: 74 underweight patients with AN and 74 age-matched female healthy controls (HC). Results Group differences for fALFF and ReHo measures were found in several AN-relevant brain regions, including networks related to cognitive control, habit formation, and the ventral visual stream. Furthermore, the magnitude of correlation between gray matter volume/thickness and fALFF and ReHo were reduced in AN compared to HC. Conclusion Abnormal local resting state characteristics in AN-related brain-networks as well as reduced structure−function relationships may help to explain previously reported task-related and classical resting state neural alterations in underweight AN. Patients with AN may serve as a valuable population for investigating dynamic changes in the relationships</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/12799744", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5038813461", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5032133633", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on microbiology, antibiotic resistance, and environmental transmission of pathogens, which is not directly relevant to the job description that emphasizes event organization, internal communication, and content creation.

In this paper we describe quantum dynamical semigroups, which are the noncommutative analogues of classical diffusions on $R$ and $R_{+}$, and demonstrate various properties of the semigroup and its generator depending on the boundary condition. We also give a proof of a result describing the domain of the generator of “noncommutative diffusion on $R_{+}$ with extinction at 0” and give an explicit example of the trace-class operator in this domain, which does not belong to the domain of closure of the initial operator.<sep>A structure theorem is established which shows that an arbitrary multimode bosonic Gaussian observable can be represented as a combination of four basic cases whose physical prototypes are homodyne and heterodyne, noiseless or noisy, measurements in quantum optics.

Along the way we give the “most economical” (in the sense of minimal dimensions of the quantum ancilla) construction of the Naimark extension of a general Gaussian observable.

The system heats up by endlessly absorbing the energy of the drive in a non-homogeneous way along the two horizons.<sep>We construct an exactly solvable lattice model of a fractional Weyl semimetal (FWS). The low energy theory of this strongly interacting state is that of a Weyl semimetal built out of fractionally charged fermions. We show the existence of a universally quantized and fractional circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) and a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the system. Together with a spectral gap in the single-particle electronic Green's function they provide strong experimental signatures for this exotic gapless state of matter.<sep>The paradigm of topological band theory has been recently challenged by the discovery of band nodes with non-Abelian topological charges. Here, the authors simplify the description of the non-Abelian topology using elementary geometric rules, and they use them to prove a relation between the monopole charge and the linking structure of nodal-line rings. Furthermore, they establish a novel braiding phenomenon induced by topological interaction of the monopole charge with the Berry phase. The analysis suggests unexpected richness of topological structures in $\\mathcal{P}\\phantom{\\rule{0}{0ex}}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems.<sep>Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) is a successful framework for identifying noninteracting topological materials, based on the symmetry analysis of the Bloch Hamiltonian and on reference states known as atomic limits. However, TQC grinds to a halt once interactions are included. Here, the authors put forward a framework analogous to TQC, but employing $n$-particle Green's function techniques to indicate topology in interacting systems. Fundamentally, they define a class of interacting reference states that generalize the notion of atomic limits, which they call Mott atomic limits. The reference states are symmetry protected topological states.<sep>We show that the gapless boundary signatures---namely, chiral/helical hinge modes or localized zero modes---of three-dimensional higher-order topological insulators and superconductors with inversion symmetry can be gapped without symmetry breaking upon the introduction of non-Abelian surface topological order. In each case, the fractionalization pattern that appears on the surface is ``anomalous'' in the sense that it can be made consistent with symmetry only on the surface of a three-dimensional higher-order insulator/superconductor. Our results show that the interacting manifestation of higher-order topology is the appearance of ``anomalous gapped boundaries'' between distinct topological orders whose quasiparticles are related by inversion, possibly in conjunction with other protecting symmetries such as time-reversal symmetry and charge conservation.<sep>We prove two Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorems that apply to any translationally invariant and local fermionic $d$-dimensional lattice Hamiltonian for which fermion-number conservation is broken down to the conservation of fermion parity. We show that when the internal symmetry group ${G}_{f}^{\\phantom{\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}}$ is realized locally (in a repeat unit cell of the lattice) by a nontrivial projective representation, then the ground state cannot be simultaneously nondegenerate, symmetric (with respect to lattice translations and ${G}_{f}^{\\phantom{\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}}$), and gapped. We also show that when the repeat unit cell hosts an odd number of Majorana degrees of freedom and the cardinality of the lattice is even, then the ground state cannot be simultaneously nondegenerate, gapped, and translation symmetric.<sep>We show that the chiral Dirac and Majorana hinge modes in three-dimensional higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) and superconductors (HOTSCs) can be gapped while preserving the protecting ${\\mathsf{C}}_{2n}\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry upon the introduction of non-Abelian surface topological order. In both cases, the topological order on a single side surface breaks time-reversal symmetry, but appears with its time-reversal conjugate on alternating sides in a ${\\mathsf{C}}_{2n}\\mathcal{T}$ preserving pattern. In the absence of the HOTI/HOTSC bulk, such a pattern necessarily involves gapless chiral modes on hinges between ${\\mathsf{C}}_{2n}\\mathcal{T}$-conjugate domains. However, using a combination of $K$-matrix and anyon condensation arguments, we show that on the boundary of a 3D HOTI/HOTSC these topological orders are fully gapped and hence ``anomalous.'' Our results suggest that new patterns of surface and hinge states can be engineered by selectively introducing topological order only on specific surfaces.<sep>We demonstrate that genuinely non-Hermitian topological phases and corresponding topological phase transitions can be naturally realized in monitored quantum circuits, exemplified by the paradigmatic non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emulate this model by a 1D chain of spinless electrons evolving under unitary dynamics and subject to periodic measurements that are stochastically invoked. The non-Hermitian topology is visible in topological invariants adapted to the context of monitored circuits. For instance, the topological phase diagram of the monitored realization of the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is obtained from the biorthogonal polarization computed from an effective Hamiltonian of the monitored system. Importantly, our monitored circuit realization allows direct access to steady state biorthogonal expectation values of generic observables, and hence, to measure physical properties of a genuine non-Hermitian model. We expect our results to be applicable more generally to a wide range of models that host non-Hermitian topological phases.<sep>We consider a 2D quantum spin model with ring-exchange interaction that has subsystem symmetries associated to conserved magnetization along rows and columns of a square lattice, which implies the conservation of the global dipole moment. The model is not integrable, but violates the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis through an extensive Hilbert space fragmentation, including an exponential number of inert subsectors with trivial dynamics, arising from kinetic constraints. While subsystem symmetries are quite restrictive for the dynamics, we show that they alone cannot account for such a number of inert states, even with infinite-range interactions. We present a procedure for constructing shielding structures that can separate and disentangle dynamically active regions from each other. Notably, subsystem symmetries allow the thickness of the shields to be dependent only on the interaction range rather than on the size of the active regions, unlike in the case of generic dipole-conserving systems.<sep>The one-dimensional (1D) Kitaev model in the topological phase, with open boundary conditions, hosts Majorana zero modes. These are fermion parity-odd operators that almost commute with the Hamiltonian and manifest in long coherence times for edge degrees of freedom. We obtain higher-dimensional counterparts of such Majorana operators by explicitly computing their closed form expressions in models describing 2D and 3D higher-order superconductors. Due to the existence of such Majorana zero modes, the coherence time of the infinite temperature autocorrelation function of the corner Majorana operators in these models diverges with the linear system size. In the presence of a certain class of orbital-selective dissipative dynamics, the coherence times of half of the corner Majorana operators are enhanced, while the time correlations corresponding to the remaining corner Majoranas decay much faster as compared with the unitary case. We numerically demonstrate robustness of the coherence times to the presence of disorder.<sep>We analyze the topological properties of a chiral ${p}+i{p}$ superconductor for a two-dimensional metal/semimetal with four Dirac points. Such a system has been proposed to realize second-order topological superconductivity and host corner Majorana modes. We show that with an additional $\\mathsf{C}_4$ rotational symmetry, the system is in an intrinsic higher-order topological superconductor phase, and with a lower and more natural $\\mathsf{C}_2$ symmetry, is in a boundary-obstructed topological superconductor phase. The boundary topological obstruction is protected by a bulk Wannier gap. However, we show that the well-known nested-Wilson loop is in general unquantized despite the particle-hole symmetry, and thus fails as a topological invariant. Instead, we show that the higher-order topology and boundary-obstructed topology can be characterized using an alternative defect classification approach, in which the corners of a finite sample is treated as a defect of a space-filling Hamiltonian. We establish \"Dirac+$({p}+i{p})$\" as a sufficient condition for second-order topological superconductivity.<sep>A bstract We explore 2-form topological gauge theories in (3+1)d. These theories can be constructed as sigma models with target space the second classifying space B 2 G of the symmetry group G , and they are classified by cohomology classes of B 2 G . For finite symmetry groups, 2-form topological theories have a natural lattice interpretation, which we use to construct a lattice Hamiltonian model in (3+1)d that is exactly solvable. This construction relies on the introduction of a cohomology, dubbed 2-form cohomology, of algebraic cocycles that are identified with the simplicial cocycles of B 2 G as provided by the so-called W -construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. We show algebraically and geometrically how a 2-form 4-cocycle reduces to the associator and the braiding isomorphisms of a premodular category of G -graded vector spaces. This is used to show the correspondence between our 2-form gauge model and the Walker-Wang model.<sep>As exemplified by the growing interest in the quantum anomalous Hall effect, the research on topology as an organizing principle of quantum matter is greatly enriched from the interplay with magnetism. In this vein, we present a combined electrical and thermoelectrical transport study on the magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd$_2$As$_2$. Topological Hall and topological Nernst effects were observed in both the antiferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phase of EuCd$_2$As$_2$, indicating the existence of significant Berry curvature. EuCd$_2$As$_2$ represents a rare case in which the topological transverse transport emerges both in the presence and absence of long-range magnetic order in the same material. The transport properties evolve with temperature and field in the antiferromagnetic phase in a different manner than in the paramagnetic phase, suggesting different mechanisms to their origin. Our results indicate EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is a fertile playground for investigating the interplay between magnetism and topology, and potentially a plethora of topologically nontrivial phases rooted in this interplay.<sep>We study the heating dynamics of a generic one dimensional critical system when driven quasiperiodically. Specifically, we consider a Fibonacci drive sequence comprising the Hamiltonian of uniform conformal field theory (CFT) describing such critical systems and its sine-square deformed counterpart. The asymptotic dynamics is dictated by the Lyapunov exponent which has a fractal structure embedding Cantor lines where the exponent is exactly zero. Away from these Cantor lines, the system typically heats up fast to infinite energy in a non-ergodic manner where the quasiparticle excitations congregate at a small number of select spatial locations resulting in a build up of energy at these points. Periodic dynamics with no heating for physically relevant timescales is seen in the high frequency regime. As we traverse the fractal region and approach the Cantor lines, the heating slows enormously and the quasiparticles completely delocalise at stroboscopic times. Our setup allows us to tune between fast and ultra-slow heating regimes in integrable systems.<sep>We study the dissipative dynamics of a periodically driven inhomogeneous critical lattice model in one dimension. The closed system dynamics starting from pure initial states is well-described by a driven Conformal Field Theory (CFT), which predicts the existence of both heating and non-heating phases in such systems. Heating is inhomogeneous and is manifested via the emergence of black-hole like horizons in the system. The robustness of this CFT phenomenology when considering thermal initial states and open systems remains elusive. First, we present analytical results for the Floquet CFT time evolution for thermal initial states. Moreover, using exact calculations of the time evolution of the lattice density matrix, we demonstrate that for short and intermediate times, the closed system phase diagram comprising heating and non-heating phases, persists for thermal initial states on the lattice. Secondly, in the fully open system with boundary dissipators, we show that the nontrivial spatial structure of the heating phase survives particle-conserving and non-conserving dissipations through clear signatures in mutual information and energy density evolution.<sep>We propose that doped Weyl semimetals with four Weyl points are natural candidates to realize higher-order topological superconductors, which exhibit a fully gapped bulk while the surface hosts robust gapless chiral hinge states. We show that in such a doped Weyl semimetal, a featureless finite-range attractive interaction favors a $p+ip$ pairing symmetry. By analyzing its topological properties, we identify such a chiral pairing state as a higher-order topological superconductor, which depending on the existence of a four-fold roto-inversion symmetry $\\mathsf{R}_{4z}$, is either intrinsic (meaning that the corresponding hinge states can only be removed by closing the bulk gap, rather than modifying the surface states) or extrinsic. We achieve this understanding via various methods recently developed for higher-order topology, including Wannier representability, Wannier spectrum, and defect classification approaches. For the $\\mathsf{R}_{4z}$ symmetric case, we provide a complete classification of the higher-order topological superconductors. We show that such second-order topological superconductors exhibit chiral hinge modes that are robust in the absence of interaction effects but can be eliminated at the cost of introducing surface topological order.<sep>The spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice is an iconic frustrated three-dimensional spin system with a rich phase diagram. Besides hosting several ordered phases, the model is debated to possess a spin-liquid ground state when only nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions are present. Here, we contest this hypothesis with an extensive numerical investigation using both exact diagonalization and complementary variational techniques. Specifically, we employ a RVB-like many-variable Monte Carlo ansatz and convolutional neural network quantum states for (variational) calculations with up to $4\\times 4^3$ and $4 \\times 3^3$ spins, respectively. We demonstrate that these techniques yield consistent results, allowing for reliable extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. Our main results are (1) the determination of the phase transition between the putative spin-liquid phase and the neighboring magnetically ordered phase and (2) a careful characterization of the ground state in terms of symmetry-breaking tendencies. We find clear indications of spontaneously broken inversion and rotational symmetry, calling the scenario of a featureless quantum spin-liquid into question. Our work showcases how many-variable variational techniques can be used to make progress in answering challenging questions about three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.<sep>Many of the experiments in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) differ from each other in terms of the details of their phase diagrams. Few controllable aspects aside, this discrepancy is largely believed to be arising from the presence of a varying degree of twist angle inhomogeneity across different samples. Real space maps indeed reveal TBG devices splitting into several large domains of different twist angles. Motivated by these observations, we study the quantum mechanical tunneling across a domain wall (DW) that separates two such regions. We show that the tunneling of the moir\\'e particles can be understood by the formation of an effective step potential at the DW. The height of this step potential is simply a measure of the difference in twist angles. These computations lead us to identify the global transport signatures for detecting and quantifying the local twist angle variations. In particular, Using Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism we compute single-channel conductance ($dI/dV$) and Fano factor for shot noise (ratio of noise power and mean current). A zero-bias, sub-meV transport gap is observed in the conductance which scales with the height of the step potential. One of the key findings of our work is that transport in presence of twist angle inhomogeneity is \"noisy\", though sub-Poissonian. In particular, the differential Fano factor peaks near the van Hove energies corresponding to the domains in the sample. The location and the strength of the peak is simply a measure of the degree of twist angle inhomogeneity.<sep>The recently introduced topological quantum chemistry (TQC) framework has provided a description of universal topological properties of all possible band insulators in all space groups based on crystalline unitary symmetries and time reversal. While this formalism filled the gap between the mathematical classification and the practical diagnosis of topological materials, an obvious limitation is that it only applies to weakly interacting systems, which can be described within band theory. It is an open question to which extent this formalism can be generalized to correlated systems that can exhibit symmetry-protected topological phases which are not adiabatically connected to any band insulator. In this work, we address the many facets of this question by considering the specific example of an extended version of a Hubbard diamond chain. This model features a Mott insulator, a trivial insulating phase, and an obstructed atomic limit phase. Here we first discuss the nature of the Mott insulator and determine the phase diagram and topology of the interacting model with infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations, variational Monte Carlo simulations, and with many-body topological invariants. We then proceed by considering a generalization of the TQC formalism to Green's functions combined with the concept of a topological Hamiltonian to identify the topological nature of the phases. Here we use cluster perturbation theory to calculate the Green's functions. The results are benchmarked with the above-determined phase diagram, and we discuss the applicability and limitations of the approach and its possible extensions in the diagnosis of topological phases in materials, in contrast to the use of many-body topological invariants.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/273252/professor-in-mathematics-/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5040625813", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5081488584", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong focus on quantum probability, noncommutative geometry, and quantum noise, which aligns well with the applied mathematics and computational aspects of the job description.

Our purpose is to determine when is it possible to design a lens made of a single homogeneous material so that it refracts light superposition of two colors into a desired fixed final direction. Two problems are considered: one is when light emanates in a parallel beam and the other is when light emanates from a point source. For the first problem, and when the direction of the parallel beam is different from the final desired direction, we show that such a lens does not exist; otherwise we prove the solution is trivial, i.e., the lens is confined between two parallel planes. For the second problem we prove that is impossible to design such a lens when the desired final direction is not among the set of incident directions. Otherwise, solving an appropriate system of functional equations we show that a local solution exists.<sep>Using optimal mass transport arguments, we prove weighted Sobolev inequalities of the form ∫ E | u ( x ) | q ω ( x ) d x 1 / q ⩽ K 0 ∫ E | ∇ u ( x ) | p σ ( x ) d x 1 / p , u ∈ C 0 ∞ ( R n ) , (WSI)where p ⩾ 1 and q > 0 is the corresponding Sobolev critical exponent.

Here, we refined the core r-protein composition in Arabidopsis thaliana by determining the abundance of different proteins during enrichment of ribosomes from cell cultures using peptide mass spectrometry. The turnover rates of 26 40S subunit r-proteins and 29 60S subunit r-proteins were also determined, showing that half of the ribosome population is replaced every 3–4 days. Three enriched proteins showed significantly shorter half-lives; a protein annotated as a ribosomal protein uL10 (RPP0D, At1g25260) with a half-life of 0.5 days and RACK1b and c with half-lives of 1–1.4 days. The At1g25260 protein is a homologue of the human Mrt4 protein, a trans-acting factor in the assembly of the pre-60S particle, while RACK1 has known regulatory roles in cell function beyond its role in the 40S subunit. Our experiments also identified 58 proteins that are not from r-protein families but co-purify with ribosomes and co-express with r-proteins; 26 were enriched more than 10-fold during ribosome enrichment. Some of these enriched proteins have known roles in translation, while others are newly proposed ribosome-associated factors in plants. This analysis provides an improved understanding of A. thaliana ribosome protein content, shows that most r-proteins turnover in unison in vivo, identifies a novel set of potential plant translatome components, and how protein turnover can help identify r-proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis or regulation in plants.<sep>SUMMARY Abiotic stress in plants causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to the need for new protein synthesis to defend against ROS and to replace existing proteins that are damaged by oxidation. Functional plant ribosomes are critical for these activities, however we know little about the impact of oxidative stress on plant ribosome abundance, turnover, and function. Using Arabidopsis cell culture as a model system, we induced oxidative stress using 1 µ m of H 2 O 2 or 5 µ m menadione to more than halve cell growth rate and limit total protein content. We show that ribosome content on a total cell protein basis decreased in oxidatively stressed cells. However, overall protein synthesis rates on a ribosome abundance basis showed the resident ribosomes retained their function in oxidatively stressed cells. 15 N progressive labelling was used to calculate the rate of ribosome synthesis and degradation to track the fate of 62 r‐proteins. The degradation rates and the synthesis rates of most r‐proteins slowed following oxidative stress leading to an ageing population of ribosomes in stressed cells. However, there were exceptions to this trend; r‐protein RPS14C doubled its degradation rate in both oxidative treatments. Overall, we show that ribosome abundance decreases and their age increases with oxidative stress in line with loss of cell growth rate and total cellular protein amount, but ribosome function of the ageing ribosomes appeared to be maintained concomittently with differences in the turnover rate and abundance of specific ribosomal proteins.

The α/β-hydrolase signalling protein KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), a close homologue of the strigolactone receptor DWARF14 (D14), is involved in this process, but it is unclear how the effects of KAI2 on development are mediated. Here, using a combination of physiological, pharmacological, genetic and imaging approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana (Heynh.) we show that kai2 phenotypes arise because of a failure to downregulate auxin transport from the seedling shoot apex towards the root system, rather than a failure to respond to light per se. We demonstrate that KAI2 controls the light-induced remodelling of the PIN-mediated auxin transport system in seedlings, promoting a reduction in PIN7 abundance in older tissues, and an increase of PIN1/PIN2 abundance in the root meristem. We show that removing PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 from kai2 mutants, or pharmacological inhibition of auxin transport and synthesis, is sufficient to suppress most kai2 seedling phenotypes. We conclude that KAI2 regulates seedling morphogenesis by its effects on the auxin transport system. We propose that KAI2 is not required for the light-mediated changes in PIN gene expression but is required for the appropriate changes in PIN protein abundance within cells.<sep>Summary Strigolactones are an important class of plant signalling molecule with both external rhizospheric and internal hormonal functions in flowering plants. The past decade has seen staggering progress in strigolactone biology, permitting highly detailed understanding of their signalling, synthesis and biological roles – or so it seems. However, phylogenetic analyses show that strigolactone signalling mediated by the D14‐ SCF MAX 2 ‐ SMXL 7 complex is only one of a number of closely related signalling pathways, and is much less ubiquitous in land plants than might be expected. The existence of closely related pathways, such as the KAI 2‐ SMAX 1 module, challenges many of our assumptions about strigolactones, and in particular emphasises how little we understand about the specificity of strigolactone signalling with respect to related signalling pathways. In this review, we examine recent advances in strigolactone signalling, taking a holistic evolutionary view to identify the ambiguities and uncertainties in our understanding. We highlight that while we now have highly detailed molecular models for the core mechanism of D14‐ SMXL 7 signalling, we still do not understand the ligand specificity of D14, the specificity of its interaction with SMXL 7, nor the specificity of SMXL 7 function. Our analysis therefore identifies key areas requiring further study.<sep>ABSTRACT Strigolactones (SLs) are endogenous signalling molecules that play important roles in controlling plant development. SL perception is closely related to that of karrikins, smoke-derived compounds presumed to mimic endogenous signalling molecules (KLs). SLs have been suggested to regulate root development. However, perception of both molecules requires the F-box protein MAX2 and the use of max2 mutants has hampered defining the exact role of SLs in roots. Here we dissect the role of SL and KL signalling in Arabidopsis root development using mutants defective in the α/β hydrolase receptors D14 and KAI2, which specifically perceive SLs and KLs, respectively. Both pathways together regulate lateral root density (LRD), but contrary to previous reports, KL signalling alone controls root hair density, root hair length and additionally root skewing, straightness and diameter. Members of the SMXL protein family are downstream targets of SL (SMXL6, 7, 8) and KL (SMAX1, SMXL2) signalling. We identified distinct and overlapping roles of these proteins in the regulation of root development. Both SMAX1/SMXL2 and SMXL6/SMXL7/SMXL8 regulate LRD, confirming that SL and KL signalling act together to regulate this trait, while the KL-signalling specific SMAX1 and SMXL2 regulate all other investigated root traits. Finally, we show that KL signalling regulates root hair development by modulating auxin distribution within the root.<sep>Root hair (RH) growth to increase the absorptive root surface area is a key adaptation of plants to limiting phosphate availability in soils. Despite the importance of this trait, especially for seedling survival, little is known about the molecular events connecting phosphate starvation sensing and RH growth regulation. KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), an α/β-hydrolase receptor of a yet-unknown plant hormone (\"KAI2-ligand\" [KL]), is required for RH elongation.1 KAI2 interacts with the F-box protein MORE AXILLIARY BRANCHING2 (MAX2) to target regulatory proteins of the SUPPRESSOR of MAX2 1 (SMAX1) family for degradation.2 Here, we demonstrate that Pi starvation increases KL signaling in Arabidopsis roots through transcriptional activation of KAI2 and MAX2. Both genes are required for RH elongation under these conditions, while smax1 smxl2 mutants have constitutively long RHs, even at high Pi availability. Attenuated RH elongation in kai2 mutants is explained by reduced shootward auxin transport from the root tip resulting in reduced auxin signaling in the RH zone, caused by an inability to increase localized accumulation of the auxin importer AUXIN TRANSPORTER PROTEIN1 (AUX1) and the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) upon Pi starvation. Consistent with AUX1 and PIN2 accumulation being mediated via ethylene signaling,3 expression of 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE 7 (ACS7) is increased at low Pi in a KAI2-dependent manner, and treatment with an ethylene precursor restores RH elongation of acs7, but not of aux1 and pin2. Thus, KAI2 signaling is increased by phosphate starvation to trigger an ethylene- AUX1/PIN2-auxin cascade required for RH elongation.<sep>Abstract Plants must carefully coordinate their growth and development with respect to prevailing environmental conditions. To do this, plants can use a range of nutritional and non‐nutritional information that allows them to proactively modulate their growth to avoid resource limitations. As is well‐known to gardeners and horticulturists alike, substrate volume strongly influences plant growth, and maybe a key source of non‐nutritional information for plants. However, the mechanisms by which these substrate volume effects occur remain unclear. Here, we show that wheat plants proactively modulate their shoot growth with respect to substrate volume, independent of nutrient availability. We show that these effects occur in two phases; in the first phase, the dilution of a mobile ‘substrate volume‐sensing signal’ (SVS) allows plants to match their shoot (but not root) growth to the total size of the substrate, irrespective of how much of this they can occupy with their roots. In the second phase, the dilution of a less mobile ‘root density‐sensing signal’ (RDS) allows plants to match root growth to actual rooting volume, with corresponding effects on shoot growth. We show that the effects of soil volume and plant density are largely interchangeable and that plants may use both SVS and RDS to detect their neighbours and to integrate growth responses to both volume and the presence of neighbours. Our work demonstrates the remarkable ability of plants to make proactive decisions about their growth, and has implications for mitigating the effects of dense sowing of crops in agricultural practice.<sep>SUMMARY The photomorphogenic remodelling of seedling growth upon exposure to light is a key developmental transition in the plant life cycle. The α/β-hydrolase signalling protein KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), a close homologue of the strigolactone receptor DWARF14 (D14), is involved in this process, and kai2 mutants have strongly altered seedling growth as a result 1 . KAI2 and D14 both act through the MAX2 (MORE AXILLARY BRANCHING2) F-box protein to target proteins of the SMAX1-LIKE (SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1) (SMXL) family for degradation, but the signalling events downstream of this step are unclear in both pathways 2 . Here, we show that kai2 phenotypes arise because of a failure to downregulate auxin transport from the seedling shoot apex towards the root system, rather than a failure to respond to light per se . We demonstrate that KAI2 controls the light-induced remodelling of the PIN-mediated auxin transport system in seedlings, promoting the reduction of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 abundance in older tissues, and the increase of PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, and PIN7 abundance in the root meristem, consistent with transition from elongation-mediated growth in the dark to meristematically-mediated growth in the light. We show that removing PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 from kai2 mutants, or pharmacological inhibition of auxin transport and synthesis, is sufficient to suppress most kai2 seedling phenotypes. KAI2 is not required for the light-mediated changes in PIN gene expression but is required for the changes in PIN protein abundance at the plasma membrane; we thus propose that KAI2 acts to promote vesicle trafficking, consistent with previous suggestions about D14-mediated signalling in the shoot 3 .<sep>Karrikins are smoke-derived compounds presumed to mimic endogenous signalling molecules (KAI2-ligand, KL), whose signalling pathway is closely related to that of strigolactones (SLs), important regulators of plant development. Both karrikins/KLs and SLs are perceived by closely related α/β hydrolase receptors (KAI2 and D14 respectively), and signalling through both receptors requires the F-box protein MAX2. Furthermore, both pathways trigger proteasome-mediated degradation of related SMAX1-LIKE (SMXL) proteins, to influence development. It has previously been suggested in multiple studies that SLs are important regulators of root and root hair development in Arabidopsis, but these conclusions are based on phenotypes observed in the non-specific max2 mutants and by use of racemic-GR24, a mixture of stereoisomers that activates both D14 and KAI2 signalling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the majority of the effects on Arabidopsis root development previously attributed to SL signalling are actually mediated by the KAI2 signalling pathway. Using mutants defective in SL or KL synthesis and/or perception, we show that KAI2-mediated signalling alone regulates root hair density and root hair length as well as root skewing, straightness and diameter, while both KAI2 and D14 pathways regulate lateral root density and epidermal cell length. We test the key hypothesis that KAI2 signals by a non-canonical receptor-target mechanism in the context of root development. Our results provide no evidence for this, and we instead show that all effects of KAI2 in the root can be explained by canonical SMAX1/SMXL2 activity. However, we do find evidence for non-canonical GR24 ligand-receptor interactions in D14/KAI2-mediated root hair development. Overall, our results demonstrate that the KAI2 signalling pathway is an important new regulator of root hair and root development in Arabidopsis and lay an important basis for research into a molecular understanding of how very similar and partially overlapping hormone signalling pathways regulate different phenotypic outputs.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/239124/research-associate-synthetic-biology-and-natural-products-discovery/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5020678571", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5053657900", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates strong expertise in plant molecular biology, particularly in protein degradation, ribosome biogenesis, and oxidative stress responses in Arabidopsis, aligning well with the project's focus on hormone perception and response in plants.

The low level of building stock turnover in the UK, estimated between 1 3% per annum, has reinforced the importance of robust retrofit programmes to meet legislated targets [1,2]; Experts predict that the majority of existing UK buildings will still be in use in 2050 [3]. Residential and commercial buildings account for approximately 20% of energy end use globally with UK industry building services such as space heating and lighting account for between 6-56% of overall building energy use, depending on sector [4]. Building Energy Modelling and Simulation (BEMS) software is used to assess the energy performance of a building based on knowledge of its construction, design, use and location. While design data is readily available for new buildings, existing buildings, that are in need of retrofit, tend to have limited as-built building data. This requires a collection of data through site surveys and manual creation of building models; This is a time consuming and expensive activity. The aim of this research was “Develop a scientific method to remove barriers to urban scale Building Energy Modelling and Simulation (BEMS) using pattern recognition software to extract built forms from large data sets”. This research has developed a process of rapid geometry generation for BEMS applications to substantially improve this workflow. Following an internal site survey, a Point Cloud was produced of a case-study building. This was automatically processed to create recognisable building geometry for BEMS applications that achieved time savings of 85% over traditional methods. It was identified that internal survey methods present limitations to the automated reconstruction process and that existing offerings for UAV mounted survey equipment required high capital expenditure. A low-cost prototype for external scanning underwent initial development and identified areas for further development. The geometry that was reconstructed via internal survey data was simulated in BEMS and compared against measured energy data. The annual energy use was predicted to within 6% of the measured energy data. Limitations to a full reconstruction led to a hybrid approach being conducted. The hybrid approach predicted annual energy use to within 4% of measured data and met industrial validation requirements. The research conducted has demonstrated that improvements to the BEMS workflow can be achieved and in doing so it can contribute to the reduction in emissions from the Built Environment.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Closed circuit<sep>Trespass<sep>Pattern recognition (psychology)<sep>Object (grammar)<sep>Bayesian probability<sep>Scale (ratio)<sep>Hydrogen<sep>Probabilistic logic<sep>Anomaly detection<sep>Outlier</keyword><title>Recent Advances in Video Analytics for Rail Network Surveillance for Security, Trespass and Suicide Prevention—A Survey<sep>Out-of-distribution Object Detection through Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation<sep>Out-of-distribution Object Detection through Bayesian Uncertainty\n  Estimation<sep>On the possibility of large-scale use of hydrogen fuel engines in real-life</title><abstract>Railway networks systems are by design open and accessible to people, but this presents challenges in the prevention of events such as terrorism, trespass, and suicide fatalities. With the rapid advancement of machine learning, numerous computer vision methods have been developed in closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance systems for the purposes of managing public spaces. These methods are built based on multiple types of sensors and are designed to automatically detect static objects and unexpected events, monitor people, and prevent potential dangers. This survey focuses on recently developed CCTV surveillance methods for rail networks, discusses the challenges they face, their advantages and disadvantages and a vision for future railway surveillance systems. State-of-the-art methods for object detection and behaviour recognition applied to rail network surveillance systems are introduced, and the ethics of handling personal data and the use of automated systems are also considered.<sep>The superior performance of object detectors is often established under the condition that the test samples are in the same distribution as the training data. However, in many practical applications, out-of-distribution (OOD) instances are inevitable and usually lead to uncertainty in the results. In this paper, we propose a novel, intuitive, and scalable probabilistic object detection method for OOD detection. Unlike other uncertainty-modeling methods that either require huge computational costs to infer the weight distributions or rely on model training through synthetic outlier data, our method is able to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) data and OOD data via weight parameter sampling from proposed Gaussian distributions based on pre-trained networks. We demonstrate that our Bayesian object detector can achieve satisfactory OOD identification performance by reducing the FPR95 score by up to 8.19% and increasing the AUROC score by up to 13.94% when trained on BDD100k and VOC datasets as the ID datasets and evaluated on COCO2017 dataset as the OOD dataset.<sep>The superior performance of object detectors is often established under the condition that the test samples are in the same distribution as the training data.

We have introduced physicality to the GEMCash currency with multiple tangible attributes.<sep>5G network slicing enables IoT networks to connect billions of heterogeneous objects providing high quality of service, high network capacity, and enhanced system throughput. It opens a new marketplace opportunity for cloud providers and network operators to sell portions of their networks to address specific customer needs in 5G applications. However, there are numerous open challenges to providing end-to-end slices due to complex business and engineering requirements from service and resource providers. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose “Kaputa”, a blockchain-enabled network slice broker and NFT-enabled network slice marketplace. Here, different stakeholders such as cloud providers, network operators, RAN providers, and transport network providers can collaborate to rent their resources. Kaputa<sep>The spread of the COVID-19 virus continues to increase fatality rates and exhaust the capacity of healthcare providers. Efforts to prevent transmission of the virus among humans remains a high priority. The current efforts to quarantine involve social distancing, monitoring and tracking the infected patients. However, the spread of the virus is too rapid to be contained only by manual and inefficient human contact tracing activities. To address this challenge, we have developed Connect, a blockchain empowered digital contact tracing platform that can leverage information on positive cases and notify people in their immediate proximity which would thereby reduce the rate at which the infection could spread. This would particularly be effective if sufficient<sep>The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has resulted in increased fatality rates across the world and has stretched the resources in healthcare facilities. There have been several proposed efforts to contain the spread of the virus among humans. Some of these efforts involve appropriate social distancing in public places, monitoring and tracking temperature at the point of access, etc. In order for us to get back to the “new normal, there is a need for automated and efficient human contact tracing that would be non-intrusive and effective in containing the spread of the virus. In this paper, we have developed “Connect, a Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) based digital contact tracing platform. “Connect will provide<sep>5G network sliced applications enable IoT networks to connect billions of heterogeneous objects, providing high-quality service, network capacity, and enhanced throughput. The blockchain systems which attempt to facilitate 5G network-sliced application requirements present several challenges, such as lack of decentralized governance, reduced transaction throughput/scalability, inability to run on resource-constrained devices, lack of support for real-time/concurrent transaction handling, and non-deterministic Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus models. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable, lightweight blockchain system, “Librum,” for 5G-based network sliced applications. Librum’s lightweight design enables it to run in edge networks, and we have designed low-cost hardware nodes to run the Librum blockchain edge network. The embedded hardware devices contain wifi and cellular<sep>In recent years, the use of UAVs has expanded to various applications such as surveillance, disaster response, agriculture, and delivery. However, traditional UAV monitoring systems rely on direct communication between the UAV and the ground pilot, which has several limitations such as limited range, poor reliability, and susceptibility to interference. To overcome these limitations, there has been significant interest in integrating UAVs into cellular networks such as 5G/6G network slicing. The flexibility of network slicing allows UAVs to operate on different slices based on their communication needs, which can improve their performance and efficiency. However, integrating UAVs into network slicing also poses several challenges, such as managing communication and permissions of UAVs and base<sep>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are used to represent ownership of unique items. The tokens provide means to validate integrity. That is, the item is unique and cannot be replaced with something else. NFTs are securely stored in the blockchain-based decentralized storage in the format of ERC721 tokens, so it is technically difficult to modify the record of ownership or duplicate a new NFT token. Currently, NFTs are used to tokenise objects such as arts, collectables, and even real estate. In this research, we propose an open platform “Indy528” and utilize NFT tokens to represent federated machine learning (FML) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first research that tries to represent<sep>Alert fatigue problems can have serious consequences for the enterprise security. When analysts become overwhelmed by the sheer number of alerts, high-risk alerts may go unnoticed or receive delayed responses, exposing the organization to potential cyber threats or data breaches. While current research on alert triage primarily concentrates on reducing false positives, analysts still face a shortage of resources to investigate all true alerts. The key to resolving this issue lies in the prioritization of alerts based on their potential severity, allowing analysts to allocate their efforts effectively. This paper introduces AlertPro, an alert prioritization framework that facilitates the alert triage and validation stage of typical SOC workflow.

Nearly 33% of overall energy consumption is attributed to the cooling infrastructure, which indicates the importance of the specific cooling configuration. Our objective is to compare four emerging and traditional DC cooling architectures, (a) in-row cooling, (b) rack-mountable cooling (RMC), (c) underfloor air delivery (UFAD), and (d) overhead air delivery. Since a first law-based energy analysis of a DC cooling architecture seldom considers irreversibility and component level inefficiency, an exergy-based analysis provides an alternate basis of assessment. We propose a methodology that combines computational fluid dynamics simulations with thermodynamic energy and exergy balances to determine the exergy loss in different components in DC. A dimensionless parameter is identified to characterize the exergy loss as a function of the Peclet number and the dimensionless dead state temperature ratio. The architecture containing RMC unit has the lowest exergy loss. The chiller loss constitutes up to 55% of the overall exergy loss. This analysis facilitates better decision making and design choices for air-cooled DCs based on minimizing thermodynamic irreversibility to lower energy waste.<sep>The rapidly rising computing workloads in data centers (DCs) have necessitated new approaches to ensure effective performance and resilience that minimize the associated cooling energy. The literature on thermally-aware workload management provides strategies to reduce this energy cost, while typically ignoring the reduction in cooling capacity due to thermodynamic irreversibility and computing performance per unit energy consumption. Hence, we provide an approach that considers coefficient of performance COPc, exergy efficiency ηex, and a new metric, computing performance ratio CPR. In contrast to existing methods that consider one-dimensional workload distributions, the temperature predictions from a physics-based zonal model are used to optimize cooling for two-dimensional workload distributions in a multi-rack DC. The investigation reveals physics associated with two-dimensional workload management for multi-rack DCs, provides a framework for trade-offs between COPc, ηex, and CPR, explains the influence of IT load factor LF on different objectives, and describes how parameters obtained from single- and multi-objective problems can vary. Our findings show that COPc, and ηex can be improved by up to 20% and 8% by regulating the chilled water temperature and airflow setpoints while increasing the LF degrades the CPR by 7.5%. These results enable an extended approach for heterogeneous LF management in large-scale DCs.<sep>Corporate social responsibility is a key factor in any organization's survival. The rapid rise of environmental problems threatens all human societies. The origin of these environmental problems can be attributed to the growth patterns of modern societies. Many corporate executives are competing with each other and looking for new solutions to enhance their organization's performance that are of major concern to today's organizations. The purpose of performance is to focus employees on task performance. The main purpose of this study is to identify the impact of social responsibility on the development of environmental resources and the performance of municipalities. The method of data collection was a researcher-made questionnaire survey. The statistical population of this research is the companies related to the environment and green space of municipalities and the number of employees in these companies is 200 persons. . The results of this study show that among the components of social responsibility with environmental resource development and internal processes performance of municipalities organizations with coefficient 0.916, environmental development and performance of municipalities organization 0.525, economic development of municipalities performance 0.688 and supplier environmental development equal 0.811. is. The relationship between supplier environmental development and competitive advantage with a coefficient of 2.166 and financial performance of 2.545 is significant. Also, there is a significant relationship between supplier environmental development and competitive advantage with a coefficient of 0.275 and financial performance of 0.228.<sep>The failure of cooling systems in data centers (DCs) leads to higher indoor temperatures, causing crucial electronic devices to fail, and produces a significant economic loss. To circumvent this issue, fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithms and associated control strategies can be applied to detect, diagnose, and isolate faults. Existing methods that apply FDD to DC cooling systems are designed to successfully overcome individually occurring faults but have difficulty in handling simultaneous faults. These methods either require expensive measurements or those made over a wide range of conditions to develop training models, which can be time-consuming and costly. We develop a rapid and accurate, single and multiple FDD strategy for a DC with a row-based cooling system using data-driven fault classifiers informed by a gray-box temperature prediction model. The gray-box model provides thermal maps of the DC airspace for single as well as a few simultaneous failure conditions, which are used as inputs for two different data-driven classifiers, CNN and RNN, to rapidly predict multiple simultaneous failures. The model is validated with testing data from an experimental DC. Also, the effect of adding Gaussian white noise to training data is discussed and observed that even with low noisy environment, the FDD strategy can diagnose multiple faults with accuracy as high as 100% while requiring relatively few simultaneous fault training data samples. Finally, the different classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall and F1-score.<sep>In response to the need to improve the energy efficiency of data centers (DCs), system designers now incorporate solutions such as continuous performance monitoring, automated diagnostics, and optimal control. While these solutions must ideally be able to predict transient conditions, in particular real time DC temperatures, existing forecasting methods are inadequate because they (1) make restrictive assumptions about system configurations, (2) are extremely time-consuming for real time applications, (3) are accurate only over limited time horizons, (4) fail to accurately model the effects of operating conditions, such as cooling unit operation conditions and server workloads, or (5) ignore important facets of the flow physics and heat transfer that can lead to large prediction errors in extrapolative predictions. To address these deficiencies, we develop a gray-box model that combines machine learning with the thermofluid transport equations relevant for a row-based cooled DC to predict transient temperatures in server CPUs and cold air inlet to the servers. An artificial neural network (ANN) embedded in the gray-box model predicts pressures, which provide inputs for the thermofluid transport equations that predict the spatio-temporal temperature distributions. The model is validated with experimental measurements for different (1) server workload distributions, (2) cooling unit set-point temperatures and (3) the airflow of the cooling units. This gray-box model exhibits superior performance compared to a conventional zonal temperature prediction model and an advanced black-box model that is based on a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model. An application of the gray-box model involves a case study to detect cooling unit fan failure in a row-based DC cooling system.<sep>The increase in cloud computing and big data storage has led to significant growth in data center (DC) infrastructure that is now estimated to consume more than 1.5% of the world’s electricity. Due to suboptimal DC design and operation, a significant fraction of this energy is wasted because of the cooling systems inability to effectively distribute cold air to servers. Consequently, additional cooling air must be circulated inside a DC to prevent local hot spots, which leads to undercooling at other locations. Row-based cooling is an emerging architecture that provides more effective airflow distribution, which lowers energy consumption. Since available methods are unsuitable for accurate online predictions, a general thermal model is required to predict spatiotemporal temperature changes inside a DC and hence optimize airflow distribution for this architecture. Typical approaches include physical models, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and black-box data-driven models (DDMs). All three approaches are limited because they do not encapsulate the entirety of relevant operational parameters, are time-consuming and can provide unacceptable errors during extrapolative predictions. We address these deficiencies by developing a fast, adaptive, and accurate hybrid surrogate model by combining a DDM and the thermofluid transport relations to predict temperatures in a DC. Training data for the DDM is obtained from CFD simulations. An artificial neural network (ANN) with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is shown to predict pressure distributions accurately in a row-based cooling DC. These predicted pressures are inputs for thermofluid transport equations to determine the temperature distribution. The applicability of the model is demonstrated by comparing predictions with experimental measurements that characterize the influence of varying server workload distribution and cooling unit operational conditions, i.e., temperature set-point, airflow rate, and fan locations, on the temperature distribution. The model can be used to (1) improve cooling configuration design, (2) facilitate thermally aware workload management, and (3) test “what if” scenarios to characterize the influence of operating conditions on the temperature distribution.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/35048/postdoctoral-associate-computational-network-modeling/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5062377042", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5044858388", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in blockchain technology, distributed ledger systems, and federated learning, which aligns well with the job's focus on computational modeling of microbial gene regulatory and metabolic networks.

Cholesterol binds SMO at two sites: one in the extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and a second in the transmembrane domain (TMD). How these two sterol-binding sites mediate SMO activation in response to the ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) remains unknown. We find that mutations in the CRD (but not the TMD) reduce the fold increase in SMO activity triggered by SHH. SHH also promotes the photocrosslinking of a sterol analog to the CRD in intact cells. In contrast, sterol binding to the TMD site boosts SMO activity regardless of SHH exposure. Mutational and computational analyses show that these sites are in allosteric communication despite being 45 angstroms apart. Hence, sterols function as both SHH-regulated orthosteric ligands at the CRD and allosteric ligands at the TMD to regulate SMO activity and Hh signaling.<sep>Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes, and is required for mammalian pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) function. Computational studies suggest direct interactions between cholesterol and pLGICs but experimental evidence identifying specific binding sites is limited. In this study, we mapped cholesterol binding to Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a model pLGIC chosen for its high level of expression, existing crystal structure, and previous use as a prototypic pLGIC. Using two cholesterol analogue photolabeling reagents with the photoreactive moiety on opposite ends of the sterol, we identified two cholesterol binding sites: an intersubunit site between TM3 and TM1 of adjacent subunits and an intrasubunit site between TM1 and TM4. In both the inter- and intrasubunit sites, cholesterol is oriented such that the 3‑OH group points toward the center of the transmembrane domains rather than toward either the cytosolic or extracellular surfaces. We then compared this binding to that of the cholesterol metabolite, allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that allosterically modulates pLGICs. The same binding pockets were identified for allopregnanolone and cholesterol, but the binding orientation of the two ligands was markedly different, with the 3‑OH group of allopregnanolone pointing to the intra- and extracellular termini of the transmembrane domains rather than to their centers. We also found that cholesterol increases, whereas allopregnanolone decreases the thermal stability of GLIC. These data indicate that cholesterol and neurosteroids bind to common hydrophobic pockets in the model pLGIC, GLIC, but that their effects depend on the orientation and specific molecular interactions unique to each sterol.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Antibiotics<sep>Drug resistance<sep>Antibiotic resistance<sep>Hydrolysis<sep>Coumarin<sep>Worker bee<sep>Corpus albicans<sep>Metal<sep>In vivo<sep>Auranofin<sep>Minimum inhibitory concentration<sep>Lipophilicity<sep>Galleria mellonella<sep>Beauveria<sep>Phenanthroline<sep>Insect<sep>Honey bee<sep>Conidiation<sep>Enterococcus faecalis<sep>Candida parapsilosis<sep>Zinc<sep>Yeast<sep>DNA damage<sep>Gliotoxin<sep>Hemolymph<sep>Candida albicans<sep>Ligand (biochemistry)<sep>Beauveria bassiana<sep>Mycelium<sep>Bassiana<sep>Benzoates<sep>Aspergillus fumigatus<sep>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<sep>A549 cell<sep>Honey Bees<sep>Escherichia coli<sep>Klebsiella pneumoniae<sep>Alkyl<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Phage therapy<sep>Antimicrobial<sep>Multiple drug resistance<sep>Cytotoxic T cell<sep>Bacteria<sep>Ethylene glycol<sep>Decomposition<sep>Klebsiella pneumonia<sep>Foraging<sep>Isatin<sep>Phenazine<sep>Proteome<sep>Pathogen<sep>Bacteriophage<sep>Oxidative stress<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Aqueous solution<sep>Copper<sep>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</keyword><title>Synthesis, structures and antimicrobial activity of novel NHC∗- and Ph3P-Ag(I)-Benzoate derivatives<sep>Stability of antibacterial Te(IV) compounds: A combined experimental and computational study<sep>Evaluation of metal-based antimicrobial compounds for the treatment of bacterial pathogens<sep>Design, Synthesis and Mechanistic Studies of Novel Isatin-Pyrazole Hydrazone Conjugates as Selective and Potent Bacterial MetAP Inhibitors<sep>Proteomic characterisation of the summer–winter transition in Apis mellifera<sep>Oosporein, an abundant metabolite in Beauveria caledonica, with a feedback induction mechanism and a role in insect virulence<sep>Structural and Spectroscopic Study of New Copper(II) and Zinc(II) Complexes of Coumarin Oxyacetate Ligands and Determination of Their Antimicrobial Activity<sep>Galleria mellonella: The Versatile Host for Drug Discovery, In Vivo Toxicity Testing and Characterising Host-Pathogen Interactions<sep>Synthesis and mechanistic studies of diketo acids and their bioisosteres as potential antibacterial agents<sep>Exposure to N-chlorotaurine induces oxidative stress responses in Aspergillus fumigatus<sep>Development of Oxadiazole-Sulfonamide-Based Compounds as Potential Antibacterial Agents<sep>Proteomic Analysis of the Responses of Candida albicans during Infection of Galleria mellonella Larvae<sep>Characterization of the Proteomic Response of A549 Cells Following Sequential Exposure to <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i><sep>Cu(<scp>ii</scp>) phenanthroline–phenazine complexes dysregulate mitochondrial function and stimulate apoptosis<sep>Synthesis, characterisation, and solution behaviour of Ag(I) bis(phenanthroline-oxazine) complexes and the evaluation of their biological activity against the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans</title><abstract>The rising threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) requires a novel approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Covalently bonded silver, which has known antibacterial and antifungal properties and multiple mechanisms of action, may provide a treatment strategy when used alone or in combination with already known antimicrobial compounds. Here we describe the synthesis of eight novel silver(I) complexes, which were screened for in vitro activity against two pathogenic bacterial strains, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), and against two pathogenic fungal strains, Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. Complexes 5–8 were synthesized by reacting triphenylphosphine in relative equivalents with the relevant silver benzoates (1, 2 & 4), whilst complexes 9–12 were synthesized by generation of a free carbene NHC∗ (1,3-dibenzyl-4,5-diphenyl-imidazol-2-ylidene) and reacting this with the silver benzoates 1–4, under Schlenk conditions. Complexes 9–12 showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, resulting in 50% inhibition of growth against MRSA and C. parapsilosis at concentrations of 12.5 and 3.25 µg/mL, respectively.<sep>Inorganic Te(IV) compounds are important cysteine protease inhibitors and antimicrobial agents; AS-101 [ammonium trichloro (dioxoethylene-O,O′)tellurate] is the first compound of a family with formula NH4[C2H4Cl3O2Te], where a Te(IV) centre is bound to a chelate ethylene glycol, and showed several protective therapeutic applications. This compound is lacking in stability performance and is subjected to hydrolysis reaction with displacement of the diol ligand. In this paper, we report the stability trend of a series of analogues complexes of AS-101 with generic formula NH4[(RC2H3O2)Cl3Te], where R is an alkyl group with different chain length and different electronic properties, in order to find a correlation between structure and stability in aqueous-physiological conditions. The stability was studied in solution via multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 125Te) and computationally at the Density Functional Theory level with an explicit micro solvation model. The combined experimental and theoretical work highlights the essential role of the solvating environment and provides mechanistic insights into the complex decomposition reaction. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds was assessed against different bacterial strains.<sep>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest global health challenges of modern times and its prevalence is rising worldwide. AMR within bacteria reduces the efficacy of antibiotics and increases both the morbidity and the mortality associated with bacterial infections. Despite this growing risk, few antibiotics with a novel mode of action are being produced, leading to a lack of antibiotics that can effectively treat bacterial infections with AMR. Metals have a history of antibacterial use but upon the discovery of antibiotics, often became overlooked as antibacterial agents. Meanwhile, metal-based complexes have been used as treatments for other diseases, such as the gold-containing drug auranofin, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Metal-based antibacterial compounds have novel modes of action that provide an advantage for the treatment of bacterial infections with resistance to conventional antibiotics. In this review, the antibacterial activity, mode of action, and potential for systemic use of a number of metal-based antibacterial complexes are discussed. The current limitations of these compounds are highlighted to determine if metal-based agents are a potential solution for the treatment of bacterial infections, especially those resistant to conventional antibiotics.<sep>Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) are attractive drug targets due to their essential role in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotic cells. In this study, biochemical assays were performed on newly synthesized Isatin-pyrazole hydrazones (PS1-14) to identify potent and selective bacterial MetAPs inhibitors. Compound PS9 inhibited prokaryotic MetAPs, i.e., MtMetAP1c, EfMetAP1a and SpMetAP1a with Ki values of 0.31, 6.93 and 0.37 µM, respectively. Interestingly, PS9 inhibited the human analogue HsMetAP1b with Ki (631.7 µM) about ten thousand-fold higher than the bacterial MetAPs. The in vitro screening against Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli) bacterial strains also exhibited their antibacterial potential supported by minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), disk diffusion assay, growth curve and time-kill curve experiments. Additionally, PS6 and PS9 had synergistic effects when combined with ampicillin (AMP) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) against selective bacterial strains. PS9 showed no significant cytotoxic effect on human RBCs, HEK293 cells and Galleria mellonella larvae in vivo. PS9 inhibited the growth of multidrug-resistant environmental isolates as it showed the MIC lower than the standard drugs used against selective bacterial strains. Overall, the study suggested PS9 could be a useful candidate for the development of antibacterial alternatives.<sep>The aim of the work presented here was to characterise the proteomic shifts that occur in worker honeybees as they transition from summer to winter. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis was performed on the heads of Apis mellifera collected from July to October to compare the proteomes of bees as the colony progressed from summer to autumn. Analysis highlighted differential protein expression between emerged bees and hive (early and late) and forager bees, highlighting the process of age polyethism within honeybees. A shift in protein expression in bees sampled in September and October compared to those sampled in July and August was also characterised. Bees sampled in September and October had a higher abundance of proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation and storage proteins such as hexamerin and a decreased abundance of major royal jelly proteins which could be an indication to the change that occurs in the hypopharyngeal gland in the winter bee. Results of this study indicate that bees emerging in September and October display significant proteomic differences compared to those that emerged in July and August, and that these changes may enable the bees to withstand the stresses of winter and perform their function of thermoregulation in the hive.<sep>Oosporein was first identified from the insect pathogen Beauveria bassiana >50 y ago. Here, we investigate the insecticidal, anti-feedant and immunomodulation effects of oosporein produced by Beauveria caledonica on the forestry pest Hylobius abietis and model insect Galleria mellonella. We report a novel feedback induction mechanism regulating oosporein production in B. caledonica; exogenous oosporein induces the expression of the oosporein cluster, leading to increased abundance of oosporein biosynthetic enzymes, as shown by label-free quantitative proteomics. Oosporein did not have an anti-feedant effect on H. abietis adults – on the contrary, insects exposed to oosporein-treated food fed more than those exposed to untreated food only. Injected oosporein did not kill insect larvae but increased susceptibility of H. abietis to a subsequent infection. Oosporein did not act as a contact toxin on H. abietis adults and G. mellonella larvae at the concentrations tested. Therefore, it appears that oosporein promotes infection rather than directly killing insects; this could be mediated both by a reduction in haemocyte numbers and by alterations to the humoral immune system. This work makes a case for future research into the potential use of B. caledonica as a biocontrol agent through combinations with oosporein or with enhanced production of oosporein.<sep>Tackling antimicrobial resistance is of increasing concern in a post-pandemic world where overuse of antibiotics has increased the threat of another pandemic caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Derivatives of coumarins, a naturally occurring bioactive compound, and its metal complexes have proven therapeutic potential as antimicrobial agents and in this study a series of copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes of coumarin oxyacetate ligands were synthesised and characterised by spectroscopic techniques (IR, 1H, 13C NMR, UV-Vis) and by X-ray crystallography for two of the zinc complexes. The experimental spectroscopic data were then interpreted on the basis of molecular structure modelling and subsequent spectra simulation using the density functional theory method to identify the coordination mode in solution for the metal ions in the complexes. Interestingly, the solid-state coordination environment of the zinc complexes is in good agreement with the simulated solution state, which has not been the case in our previous studies of these ligands when coordinated to silver(I). Previous studies had indicated excellent antimicrobial activity for Ag(I) analogues of these ligands and related copper and zinc complexes of coumarin-derived ligands, but in this study none of the complexes displayed antimicrobial activity against the clinically relevant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.<sep>Larvae of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, are a convenient in vivo model for assessing the activity and toxicity of antimicrobial agents and for studying the immune response to pathogens and provide results similar to those from mammals. G. mellonella larvae are now widely used in academia and industry and their use can assist in the identification and evaluation of novel antimicrobial agents. Galleria larvae are inexpensive to purchase and house, easy to inoculate, generate results within 24-48 h and their use is not restricted by legal or ethical considerations. This review will highlight how Galleria larvae can be used to assess the efficacy of novel antimicrobial therapies (photodynamic therapy, phage therapy, metal-based drugs, triazole-amino acid hybrids) and for determining the in vivo toxicity of compounds (e.g., food preservatives, ionic liquids) and/or solvents (polysorbate 80). In addition, the disease development processes are associated with a variety of pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, Madurella mycotomatis) in mammals are also present in Galleria larvae thus providing a simple in vivo model for characterising disease progression. The use of Galleria larvae offers many advantages and can lead to an acceleration in the development of novel antimicrobials and may be a prerequisite to mammalian testing.<sep>A series of diketo esters and their pertinent bioisosteres were designed and synthesized as potent antibacterial agents by targeting methionine amino peptidases (MetAPs). In the biochemical assay against purified MetAPs from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpMetAP1a), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtMetAP1c), Enterococcus faecalis (EfMetAP1a) and human (HsMetAP1b), compounds 3a, 4a and 5a showed more than 85% inhibition of all the tested MetAPs at 100 μM concentration. Compounds 4a and 5a also exhibited antibacterial potential with MIC values 62.5 μg/mL (S. pneumoniae), 31.25 μg/mL (E. faecalis), 62.5 μg/mL (Escherichia coli) and 62.5 μg/mL (S. pneumoniae), 62.5 μg/mL (E. coli), respectively. Moreover, 5a also significantly inhibited the growth of multidrug resistant E. coli strains at 512 μg/mL conc., while showing no cytotoxic effect towards healthy CHO cells and thus being selected. Growth kinetics study showed significant inhibition of bacterial growth when treated with different conc. of 5a. TEM analysis also displayed vital damage to bacterial cells by 5a at MIC conc. Moreover, significant inhibition of biofilm formation was observed in bacterial cells treated with MIC conc. of 5a as visualized by SEM micrographs. Interestingly, 5a did not cause an alteration in the hemocyte density in Galleria mellonella larvae which is considered in vivo model for antimicrobial studies and was non-toxic up to a conc. of 2.5 mg/mL.<sep>The neutrophil-derived oxidant N-chlorotaurine (NCT) displays remarkable in vivo tolerability and efficacy against a range of pathogens. The aim of this study was to characterize the response of the pulmonary pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus to NCT.The effect of NCT on the growth and viability of A. fumigatus was characterized. NCT-induced alteration of amino acids and gliotoxin from A. fumigatus mycelium was assessed. Label-free shotgun quantitative proteomic analysis was performed on A. fumigatus exposed to NCT for 24 h.Incubation of A. fumigatus with NCT at concentrations ranging from 6.8 to 55 mM decreased conidial growth and viability, and mycelium biomass relative to the controls. Exposure to NCT (13.77 mM) resulted in increased amino acids and gliotoxin levels from A. fumigatus mycelium. Exposure of A. fumigatus mycelium to NCT (6.8 mM) revealed an enrichment in proteins associated with the ribosome, transcription and translation and non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis (e.g. Pes1, Pes3), which play an essential role in oxidative stress resistance in A. fumigatus. A decrease in the abundance of proteins associated with fumagillin and pseurotin biosynthesis highlighted the anti-virulence activity of NCT.These results indicate that NCT induces an oxidative stress response in A. fumigatus as evidenced by alterations in the proteome and inhibits conidial and mycelial growth. Clinical investigations of topical application of NCT to treat Aspergillus infections are encouraged.<sep>In this work, substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazoles (OX1-OX27) were screened against five bacterial strains, identified to be OX7 and OX11 as growth inhibitors with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 31.25 and 15.75 μg/mL, respectively. The growth inhibitory property of OX7 and OX11 was further validated by disk diffusion, growth curve, and time kill curve assays. Both disrupted biofilm formation with 92-100% reduction examined by the XTT assay were further visualized by scanning electron microscopy analysis. These compounds in combination with ciprofloxacin also exhibit synergy against Escherichia coli cells. With insignificant cytotoxic behavior on HEK293 cells, human red blood cells, and Galleria mellonella larvae, OX11 was tested against 28 multidrug resistant environmental isolates of bacteria and showed inhibition of Kluyvera georgiana and Citrobacter werkmanii strains with 32 and 16 μg/mL MIC values, respectively. The synergistic behavior of OX11 with ampicillin showed many fold reductions in MIC values against K. georgiana and Klebsiella pneumoniae multidrug resistant strains. Further, transmission electron microscopy analysis of OX11-treated E. coli cells showed a significantly damaged cell wall, which resulted in the loss of integrity and cytosolic oozing. OX11 showed significant changes in the secondary structure of human serum albumin (HSA) in the presence of OX11, enhancing HSA stability. Overall, the study provided a suitable core for further synthetic alterations and development as an antibacterial agent.<sep>This study assessed the development of disseminated candidiasis within Galleria mellonella larvae and characterized the proteomic responses of Candida albicans to larval hemolymph. Infection of larvae with an inoculum of 1 × 106 yeast cells reduced larval viability 24 (53.33 ± 3.33%), 48 (33.33 ± 3.33%) and 72 (6.66 ± 3.33%) h post infection. C. albicans infection quickly disseminated from the site of inoculation and the presence of yeast and hyphal forms were found in nodules extracted from infected larvae at 6 and 24 h. A range of proteins secreted during infection of G. mellonella by C. albicans were detected in larval hemolymph and these were enriched for biological processes such as interaction with host and pathogenesis. The candicidal activity of hemolymph after immediate incubation of yeast cells resulted in a decrease in yeast cell viability (0.23 ± 0.03 × 106 yeast cells/mL), p &lt; 0.05) as compared to control (0.99 ± 0.01 × 106 yeast cells/mL). C. albicans responded to incubation in hemolymph ex vivo by the induction of an oxidative stress response, a decrease in proteins associated with protein synthesis and an increase in glycolytic proteins. The results presented here indicate that C. albicans can overcome the fungicidal activity of hemolymph by altering protein synthesis and cellular respiration, and commence invasion and dissemination throughout the host.<sep>Aspergillus fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most prevalent fungal and bacterial pathogens associated with cystic-fibrosis-related infections, respectively. P. aeruginosa eventually predominates as the primary pathogen, though it is unknown why this is the case. Label-free quantitative proteomics was employed to investigate the cellular response of the alveolar epithelial cell line, A549, to coexposure of A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa. These studies revealed a significant increase in the rate of P. aeruginosa proliferation where A. fumigatus was present. Shotgun proteomics performed on A549 cells exposed to either A. fumigatus or P. aeruginosa or to A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa sequentially revealed distinct changes to the host cell proteome in response to either or both pathogens. While key signatures of infection were retained among all pathogen-exposed groups, including changes in mitochondrial activity and energy output, the relative abundance of proteins associated with endocytosis, phagosomes, and lysosomes was decreased in sequentially exposed cells compared to cells exposed to either pathogen. Our findings indicate that A. fumigatus renders A549 cells unable to internalize bacteria, thus providing an environment in which P. aeruginosa can proliferate. This research provides novel insights into the whole-cell proteomic response of A549 cells to A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa and highlights distinct differences in the proteome following sequential exposure to both pathogens, which may explain why P. aeruginosa can predominate.<sep>Abstract Herein we report an in-depth study on the cytotoxic mechanism of action of four developmental cytotoxic copper(ii) complexes: [Cu(phen)2]2+ (Cu-Phen); [Cu(DPQ)(Phen)]2+ (Cu-DPQ-Phen); [Cu(DPPZ)(Phen)]2+; and [Cu(DPPN)(Phen)]2+ (where Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, DPQ = dipyrido[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline, DPPZ = dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine, and DPPN = benzo[i]dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine). This complex class is known for its DNA intercalative properties and recent evidence—derived from an in vivo proteomic study—supports the potential targeting of mitochondrial function. Therefore, we focused on mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis related to cytotoxic activity and the potential impact these agents have on mitochondrial function. The Cu(ii) complexes demonstrated superior activity regardless of aromatic extension within the phenazine ligand to the previously demonstrated activity of cisplatin. Unique toxicity mechanisms were also identified in prior demonstrated cisplatin sensitive and resistant cell lines. Double strand breaks in genomic DNA, quantified by γH2AX foci formation, were then coupled with apoptotic gene expression to elucidate the mechanisms of cell death. These results indicate that while DNA damage-induced apoptosis by BAX, XIAP and caspase-9 and -3 expression is moderate for the Cu(ii) complexes when compared to cisplatin, protein targets independent of DNA exert a multimodal mechanistic effect. Significantly, mitochondrial gene expression of oxidative stress, protease expression, and fission/fusion processes—upregulated HMOX, DRP1 and LON, respectively—indicated an increased oxidative damage associated with compromised mitochondrial health upon exposure to these agents. These data support a unique mode of action by these complexes and provide valuable evidence of the developmental potential of these therapeutic inorganic complexes.<sep>Abstract Three Ag(I) bis (phenanthroline-oxazine) complexes with varying lipophilicity were synthesised and characterised. The solution stoichiometry of 1:2 Ag(I):ligand was determined for each complex by the continuous variation Job’s plot method using NMR spectroscopy. NMR studies were also carried out to investigate the fluxional behaviour of the Ag(I) complexes in solution. The biological activity of the silver(I) complexes and the corresponding ligands towards a clinical strain of Candida albicans MEN was studied using broth microdilution assays. Testing showed the choice of media and the duration of incubation were key determinants of the inhibitory behaviour towards Candida albicans, however, the difference between freshly prepared and pre-prepared solutions was insignificant in minimal media. The activity of the metal-free ligands correlated with the length of the alkyl chain. In minimal media, the methyl ester phenanthroline-oxazine ligand was effective only at 60 μM, limiting growth to 67% of the control, while a 60 μM dose of the propyl ester analogue limited fungal growth at &lt; 20% of the control. MIC 50 and MIC 80 values for the propyl and hexyl ester analogues were calculated to be 45 and 59 µM (propyl), and 18 and 45 µM (hexyl). Moreover, in a study of activity as a function of time it was observed that the hexyl ester ligand maintained its activity for longer than the methyl and propyl analogues; after 48 h a 60 μM dose held fungal growth at 24% of that of the control. Complexation to Ag(I) was much more effective in enhancing biological activity of the ligands than was increasing the ester chain length. Significantly no difference in activity between the three silver(I) complexes was observed under the experimental conditions. All three complexes were substantially more active than their parent ligands against Candida albicans and AgClO 4 and the three silver(I) bis (phen-oxazine) complexes have MIC 80 values of &lt; 15 μM. The ability of the silver(I) complexes to hold fungal growth at about 20% of the control even after 48 h incubation at low dosages (15 μM) showcases their superiority over the simple silver(I) perchlorate salt, which ceased to be effective at dosages below 60 μM at the extended time point.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/169013/postdoctoral-research-associate-in-bacterial-metal-homeostasis/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5061249734", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5043776406", "response": "Comparison: Candidate B demonstrates a stronger alignment with the job description, particularly in the areas of bacterial metal homeostasis, antimicrobial activity, and cross-disciplinary techniques, as evidenced by their extensive research on metal-based antimicrobial compounds and bacterial pathogens.

Here, we describe the adoptive transfer of ILC progenitors into mice genetically deficient in innate and adaptive immune cells to allow detailed study of the development and function of ILCs and gene regulation in an in vivo setting. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Jacquelot et al. (2021) and Seillet et al. (2016).<sep>Reinvigorating the killing function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells through the targeting of regulatory molecules expressed on lymphocytes has markedly improved the prognosis of cancer patients, particularly in melanoma. While initially thought to solely strengthen adaptive T lymphocyte anti-tumor activity, recent investigations suggest that other immune cell subsets, particularly tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), may benefit from immunotherapy treatment. Here, we describe the recent findings showing immune checkpoint expression on tissue-resident and tumor-infiltrating ILCs and how their effector function is modulated by checkpoint blockade-based therapies in cancer. We discuss the therapeutic potential of ILCs beyond the classical PD-1 and CTLA-4 regulatory molecules, exploring other possibilities to manipulate ILC effector function to further impede tumor growth and quench disease progression.<sep>Adaptive and innate immune cells have typically been functionally and temporally segregated even though they share a number of salient features. Over the past decade, significant advances have been made in understanding the composition and diversity of both innate and adaptive cell populations. This has shed light on how cells from two distinct pathways are so highly complementary. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are pivotally positioned in tissues to form a stable population akin to tissue-resident T cells that protects the body. Nevertheless, the pathway by which different lymphocytes enter tissues, terminally differentiate and are replenished to maintain populations remains incompletely understood. Recent evidence challenges our assumptions about the sedentary lifestyles of so called 'tissue-resident cells' and pushes us to consider their roles in orchestrating protection of the immune system beyond the classical models.<sep>Hierarchical self-assembly offers great possibilities to mimic biological systems with finely arranged complex structures. Herein, we demonstrate the preparation and formation mechanism of an unusual giant polymer vesicle with a latticelike membrane (GVLM). This GVLM is formed by fusion-induced particle assembly (FIPA) of small vesicles that are self-assembled from poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly[(2-(tetrahydrofuranyloxy)ethyl methacrylate)-stat-(6-(3,3-diphenylnaphthopyranyloxy)hexyl methacrylate)] [PEO43-b-P(TMA22-stat-NMA4)]. Flexible TMA units with high chain mobility and relatively rigid NMA units with intrinsic π-π stacking form the hydrophobic block. These units act as \"antifusion\" and \"profusion\" components, respectively. The latticelike membrane of the final GVLM consists of hundreds of small polymer vesicles that are interconnected via multiple interactions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies show that the diameter of the GVLMs is 800-1000 nm. Overall, we provide a new insight into the judicious preparation of hierarchical nanostructures via chemical synthesis and FIPA.<sep>Chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. While the role of adaptive T cells in CRC is now well established, the role of innate immune cells, specifically innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), is not well understood. To define the role of ILCs in CRC we employed complementary heterotopic and chemically-induced CRC mouse models. We discovered that ILCs were abundant in CRC tumours and contributed to anti-tumour immunity. We focused on ILC2 and showed that ILC2-deficient mice developed a higher tumour burden compared with littermate wild-type controls. We generated an ILC2 gene signature and using machine learning models revealed that CRC patients with a high intratumor ILC2 gene signature had a favourable clinical prognosis. Collectively, our results highlight a critical role for ILC2 in CRC, suggesting a potential new avenue to improve clinical outcomes through ILC2-agonist based therapeutic approaches.<sep>Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are essential to maintain tissue homeostasis. In cancer, ILC2s can harbor both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic functions, but we know little about their underlying mechanisms or whether they could be clinically relevant or targeted to improve patient outcomes. Here, we found that high ILC2 infiltration in human melanoma was associated with a good clinical prognosis. ILC2s are critical producers of the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which coordinates the recruitment and activation of eosinophils to enhance antitumor responses. Tumor-infiltrating ILC2s expressed programmed cell death protein-1, which limited their intratumoral accumulation, proliferation and antitumor effector functions. This inhibition could be overcome in vivo by combining interleukin-33-driven ILC2 activation with programmed cell death protein-1 blockade to significantly increase antitumor responses. Together, our results identified ILC2s as a critical immune cell type involved in melanoma immunity and revealed a potential synergistic approach to harness ILC2 function for antitumor immunotherapies.<sep>Interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD8+ T (Tc17) cells have emerged as key players in host-microbiota interactions, infection, and cancer. The factors that drive their development, in contrast to interferon (IFN)-γ-producing effector CD8+ T cells, are not clear. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor TCF-1 (Tcf7) regulates CD8+ T cell fate decisions in double-positive (DP) thymocytes through the sequential suppression of MAF and RORγt, in parallel with TCF-1-driven modulation of chromatin state. Ablation of TCF-1 resulted in enhanced Tc17 cell development and exposed a gene set signature to drive tissue repair and lipid metabolism, which was distinct from other CD8+ T cell subsets. IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells isolated from healthy humans were also distinct from CD8+IL-17- T cells and enriched in pathways driven by MAF and RORγt Overall, our study reveals how TCF-1 exerts central control of T cell differentiation in the thymus by normally repressing Tc17 differentiation and promoting an effector fate outcome.<sep>The immune system plays a fundamental role at mucosal barriers in maintaining tissue homeostasis. This is particularly true for the gut where cells are flooded with microbial-derived signals and antigens, which constantly challenge the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Multiple immune cell populations equipped with both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions reside in the gut tissue and these cells tightly regulate intestinal health and functions. Dysregulation of this finely tuned system can progressively lead to autoimmune disease and inflammation-driven carcinogenesis. Over the last decade, the contribution of the adaptive immune system in controlling colorectal cancer has been studied in detail, but the role of the innate system, particularly innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), have been largely overlooked. By sensing their microenvironment, ILCs are essential in supporting gut epithelium repair and controling bacterial- and helminth-mediated intestinal infections, highlighting their important role in maintaining tissue integrity. Accumulating evidence also suggests that they may play an important role in carcinogenesis including intestinal cancers. In this review, we will explore the current knowledge about the pro- and anti-tumour functions of ILCs in colorectal cancer.<sep>The effect of continuous drying for 360 days on the performance of sulfoaluminate cement (SAC) with different contents of gypsum was investigated, with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) selected as the control. First, the compressive strengths and deformation of mortars dried at 40 °C for different times were tested. Meanwhile, for the hardened cement pastes dried under the same condition, the mineral phase, micromorphology, and pore structure evolutions were monitored. Results indicated that the compressive strength of SAC mortars showed a significant decrease after 360 days of drying, whereas the compressive strength of OPC mortar was still higher than that before drying. Moreover, the SAC mortars with high gypsum content exhibited significant shrinkage after drying. This was because the ettringites lost crystal water during the drying process, and the crystallinity decreased gradually until they were amorphous. Meanwhile, the ettringites showed a shriveled morphology after drying, and became weaker than before drying. Besides, both the pore size and total porosities of the SAC hardened cement pastes showed a noticeable increase after 360 days of drying. However, the hydration products of OPC were stable under the same dry condition. This study provides direct evidence to explain the mechanical strength reduction of SAC in service.<sep>Abstract Interleukin-(IL) 22 production by intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) is critical to maintain gut homeostasis. However, IL-22 needs to be tightly controlled; reduced IL-22 expression is associated with intestinal epithelial barrier defect while its overexpression promotes tumor development. Here, using a single cell RNAseq approach, we identified a core set of genes associated with increased IL-22 production by ILC3. Among these genes, Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), extensively studied in the context of cancer and chronic infection, was constitutively expressed on a subset of ILC3. These cells, found in the crypt of the small intestine and colon, displayed superior capacity to produce IL-22. PD-1 expression on ILC3 was dependent on the microbiota and was induced during inflammation in response to IL-23 but, conversely, was reduced in the presence of Notch ligand. PD-1+ ILC3 exhibited distinct metabolic activity with increased glycolytic, lipid and polyamine synthesis associated with augmented proliferation compared with their PD-1- counterparts. Further, PD-1+ ILC3 showed increased expression of mitochondrial antioxidant proteins which enable the cells to maintain their levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Loss of PD-1 signaling in ILC3 led to reduced IL-22 production in a cell intrinsic manner. During inflammation, PD-1 expression was increased on NCR- ILC3 while deficiency in PD-1 expression resulted in increased susceptibility to experimental colitis and failure to maintain gut barrier integrity. Collectively, our findings uncover a new function of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and highlight the role of PD-1 signaling in the maintenance of gut homeostasis mediated by ILC3.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Programmed cell death<sep>Microglia<sep>Oxidative phosphorylation<sep>Disease<sep>Neuroinflammation<sep>Astrocyte<sep>MAPK/ERK pathway<sep>Parkinson's disease<sep>Dementia<sep>Reactive oxygen species<sep>Proinflammatory cytokine<sep>Central nervous system<sep>TRPM2<sep>Substantia nigra<sep>Transient receptor potential channel<sep>Cell damage<sep>Oxidative stress<sep>PIEZO1<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>NF-κB<sep>Signal transduction</keyword><title>TRPM2 channel in oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic cell death<sep>TRPM2 Channel in Microglia as a New Player in Neuroinflammation Associated With a Spectrum of Central Nervous System Pathologies<sep>Predisposition to Alzheimer’s and Age-Related Brain Pathologies by PM2.5 Exposure: Perspective on the Roles of Oxidative Stress and TRPM2 Channel<sep>Astrocytic Changes in Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation Protein Levels in Parkinson's Disease<sep>TRPM2 channel-mediated cell death: An important mechanism linking oxidative stress-inducing pathological factors to associated pathological conditions<sep>Piezo1 channel‐mediated <scp>C</scp>a<sup>2+</sup> signaling inhibits lipopolysaccharide‐induced activation of the <scp>NF‐κB</scp> inflammatory signaling pathway and generation of <scp>TNF</scp>‐α and <scp>IL</scp>‐6 in microglial cells</title><abstract>Mitochondria, conserved intracellular organelles best known as the powerhouse of cells for generating ATP, play an important role in apoptosis. Oxidative stress can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and activate mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death. TRPM2 is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel that is activated by pathologically relevant concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and one of its well-recognized roles is to confer susceptibility to ROS-induced cell death. Increasing evidence from recent studies supports TRPM2 channel-mediated cell death as an important cellular mechanism linking miscellaneous oxidative stress-inducing pathological factors to associated diseased conditions. In this chapter, we will discuss the role of the TRPM2 channel in neurons in the brain and pancreatic β-cells in mediating mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death, focusing mainly on apoptotic cell death, that are induced by pathological stimuli implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic stroke and diabetes.<sep>Microglial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) are crucial in maintaining a healthy environment for neurons to function properly. However, aberrant microglial cell activation can lead to excessive generation of neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators and neuroinflammation, which represents a contributing factor in a wide spectrum of CNS pathologies, including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain damage, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, psychiatric disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and chronic neuropathic pain. Oxidative stress is a salient and common feature of these conditions and has been strongly implicated in microglial cell activation and neuroinflammation. The transient receptor potential melastatin-related 2 (TRPM2) channel, an oxidative stress-sensitive calcium-permeable cationic channel, is highly expressed in microglial cells. In this review, we examine the recent studies that provide evidence to support an important role for the TRPM2 channel, particularly TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ signaling, in mediating microglial cell activation, generation of proinflammatory mediators and neuroinflammation, which are of relevance to CNS pathologies. These findings lead to a growing interest in the TRPM2 channel, a new player in neuroinflammation, as a novel therapeutic target for CNS diseases.<sep>Accumulating epidemiological evidence supports that chronic exposure to ambient fine particular matters of <2.5 μm (PM2.5) predisposes both children and adults to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related brain damage leading to dementia. There is also experimental evidence to show that PM2.5 exposure results in early onset of AD-related pathologies in transgenic AD mice and development of AD-related and age-related brain pathologies in healthy rodents. Studies have also documented that PM2.5 exposure causes AD-linked molecular and cellular alterations, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic deficits, impaired neurite growth, neuronal cell death, glial cell activation, neuroinflammation, and neurovascular dysfunction, in addition to elevated levels of amyloid β (Aβ) and tau phosphorylation. Oxidative stress and the oxidative stress-sensitive TRPM2 channel play important roles in mediating multiple molecular and cellular alterations that underpin AD-related cognitive dysfunction. Documented evidence suggests critical engagement of oxidative stress and TRPM2 channel activation in various PM2.5-induced cellular effects. Here we discuss recent studies that favor causative relationships of PM2.5 exposure to increased AD prevalence and AD- and age-related pathologies, and raise the perspective on the roles of oxidative stress and the TRPM2 channel in mediating PM2.5-induced predisposition to AD and age-related brain damage.<sep>Mitochondrial dysfunction within neurons, particularly those of the substantia nigra, has been well characterized in Parkinson's disease and is considered to be related to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Dysfunction within this important organelle has been suggested to impair neuronal communication and survival; however, the reliance of astrocytes on mitochondria and the impact of their dysfunction on this essential cell type are less well characterized.This study aimed to uncover whether astrocytes harbor oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiencies in Parkinson's disease and whether these deficiencies are more likely to occur in astrocytes closely associated with neurons or those more distant from them.Postmortem human brain sections from patients with Parkinson's disease were subjected to imaging mass cytometry for individual astrocyte analysis of key OXPHOS proteins across all five complexes.We show the variability in the astrocytic expression of mitochondrial proteins between individuals. In addition, we found that there is evidence of deficiencies in respiratory chain subunit expression within these important glia and changes, particularly in mitochondrial mass, associated with Parkinson's disease and that are not simply a consequence of advancing age.Our data show that astrocytes, like neurons, are susceptible to mitochondrial defects and that these could have an impact on their reactivity and ability to support neurons in Parkinson's disease.<sep>Oxidative stress resulting from the accumulation of high levels of reactive oxygen species is a salient feature of, and a well-recognised pathological factor for, diverse pathologies. One common mechanism for oxidative stress damage is via the disruption of intracellular ion homeostasis to induce cell death. TRPM2 is a non-selective Ca2+-permeable cation channel with a wide distribution throughout the body and is highly sensitive to activation by oxidative stress. Recent studies have collected abundant evidence to show its important role in mediating cell death induced by miscellaneous oxidative stress-inducing pathological factors, both endogenous and exogenous, including ischemia/reperfusion and the neurotoxicants amyloid-β peptides and MPTP/MPP+ that cause neuronal demise in the brain, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, proinflammatory mediators that disrupt endothelial function, diabetogenic agent streptozotocin and diabetes risk factor free fatty acids that induce loss of pancreatic β-cells, bile acids that damage pancreatic acinar cells, renal ischemia/reperfusion and albuminuria that are detrimental to kidney cells, acetaminophen that triggers hepatocyte death, and nanoparticles that injure pericytes. Studies have also shed light on the signalling mechanisms by which these pathological factors activate the TRPM2 channel to alter intracellular ion homeostasis leading to aberrant initiation of various cell death pathways. TRPM2-mediated cell death thus emerges as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of conditions including ischemic stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, pancreatitis, chronic kidney disease, liver damage and neurovascular injury. These findings raise the exciting perspective of targeting the TRPM2 channel as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat such oxidative stress-associated diseases.<sep>Microglial cells are crucial in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and mediating CNS disease pathogenesis. Increasing evidence supports that alterations in the mechanical properties of CNS microenvironments influence glial cell phenotypes, but the mechanisms regulating microglial cell function remain elusive. Here, we examined the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel in microglial cells, particularly, how Piezo1 channel activation regulates pro-inflammatory activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, using BV2 and primary microglial cells. Piezo1 expression in microglial cells was detected both at mRNA and protein levels. Application of Piezo1 channel activator Yoda1 induced Ca2+ flux to increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration that was reduced by treatment with ruthenium red, a Piezo1 inhibitor, or Piezo1-specific siRNA, supporting that Piezo1 functions as a cell surface Ca2+ -permeable channel. Priming with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced microglial cell activation and production of TNF-α and IL-6, which were inhibited by treatment with Yoda1. Furthermore, LPS priming induced the activation of ERK, p38 MAPKs, and NF-κB. LPS-induced activation of NF-κB, but not ERK and p38, was inhibited by treatment with Yoda1. Yoda1-induced inhibition was blunted by siRNA-mediated depletion of Piezo1 expression and, furthermore, treatment with BAPTA-AM to prevent intracellular Ca2+ increase. Collectively, our results support that Piezo1 channel activation downregulates the pro-inflammatory function of microglial cells, especially production of TNF-α and IL-6, by initiating intracellular Ca2+ signaling to inhibit the NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway. These findings reveal Piezo1 channel activation as a previously unrecognized mechanism regulating microglial cell function, raising an interesting perspective on targeting this molecular mechanism to alleviate neuroinflammation and associated CNS pathologies.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/192863/postdoctoral-research-fellow-in-molecular-genetics/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5087590824", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5013010742", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in molecular genetics and cell biology, with a focus on innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and their role in cancer and immune responses, aligning well with the research focus on insect odorant receptor function using Drosophila melanogaster.

The computational models used nonlinear finite element method involving large deformations (strains) of both vessel and offshore platform, dynamic effects of material (e.g., strain rate and dynamic fracture strain), and the influence of surrounding waters. The applicability of the modelling techniques was demonstrated with an applied example to collisions between an OSV and a jacket-type offshore platform, where a sensitivity analysis was carried out for different collision parameters (e.g., collision velocities and impact locations). It is concluded that the computational models can ultimately be employed for quantitative risk assessment of fixed-type offshore structures collided with an OSV, which requires to perform the structural crashworthiness analysis.<sep>The dynamic response of ships following grounding and collision accidents may be influenced by structural topology as well as operational and environmental conditions. Traditionally, the consequences of such events may be assessed by crude empirical methods or laborious experiments. Computational methods offer a useful alternative in terms of accurately capturing crushing mechanisms also accounting the influence of surrounding water. This paper presents a benchmark study that compares the structural dynamic response by explicit nonlinear FEA approaches and the semi-numerical super-element method. Simulations for typical accident scenarios involving passenger ships confirm that implementing the influence of hydrodynamic restoring forces in way of contact may be useful for either collision or grounding. Yet, for grounding scenarios, the damaged area resulting from analytical simulations appears to be sensitive to the failure strain values adopted to model the rupture of the ship bottom floors.<sep>Development of damage stability as a scientific subject, specifically in damage ship hydrodynamics and, generally, flooding risk assessment, has evolved primarily by inquisitive academics with support by people with vision and passion towards maritime safety enhancement from industry and Government, the latter in the wake of serious accidents. Notwithstanding this, the subject has seen remarkable development in a short period of time in terms of understanding process, and developing methods and tools for practical implementation of such developments. The stage has now been reached where large-scale EC and industry-funded projects are bringing all requisite knowledge and experience together towards implementation by end users with the view to institutionalizing such developments. The paper critically traces and presents key developments starting from basic concepts to a complete framework for performing numerical simulations of ship survivability in operational conditions in the seaway, leading to flooding risk assessment with application potential for new and existing ships with focus on the design phase but with operation potential in ship operation, the latter involving emergencies.<sep>The paper provides a full description and explanation of the probabilistic method for ship damage stability assessment from its conception to date with focus on the probability of survival (s-factor), explaining pertinent assumptions and limitations and describing its evolution for specific application to passenger ships, using contemporary numerical and experimental tools and data. It also provides comparisons in results between statistical and direct approaches and makes recommendations on how these can be reconciled with better understanding of the implicit assumptions in the approach for use in ship design and operation. Evolution over the latter years to support pertinent regulatory developments relating to flooding risk (safety level) assessment as well as research in this direction with a focus on passenger ships, have created a new focus that combines all flooding hazards (collision, bottom and side groundings) to assess potential loss of life as a means of guiding further research and developments on damage stability for this ship type. The paper concludes by providing recommendations on the way forward for ship damage stability and flooding risk assessment.<sep>Offshore supply vessel (OSV) collisions have been identified as the most frequent type of collision accidents in the offshore oil/gas or wind turbine industries. Quantitative risk assessment (QRA) is an efficient method for evaluating the collision risk to an offshore installation. In-depth information on collision load parameters, such as incoming ship velocity and impact location, is considered prerequisite for determining the consequences of collisions with accuracy. Thus, the aim of this study is to provide a new probabilistic method for determining collision design loads. Each input parameter is treated by a probability density function, and a set of 50 prospective collision scenarios is generated using Latin hyper cube sampling (LHS) technique. Numerical computations of ship motions are performed to obtain collision load parameters. The probabilistic characteristics of the parameters using a goodness of fit test and an interval study are carried out, and best-fit probability density functions and the exceedance curves are established. A case study of the proposed method is demonstrated using a hypothetical OSV and an offshore jacket structure located in a hypothetical oceanic region. The details of the computations are documented, and the findings of the study are discussed.<sep>The paper complements an earlier publication by the authors addressing the probability of survival in the IMO framework for damage stability assessment, the s-factor. The focus here is on the probability of occurrence of a certain damage scenario (breach), conditional on its dimensions and location (centre and port or starboard side), the p-factor. Pertinent assumptions and limitations are explained, following its evolution for specific application to passenger ships. Attempts to provide analytical descriptions of the damage breach distributions as tetrahedra shapes positioned along the ship length whilst accounting for changes in ship geometry, structural arrangements, and subdivision for consumption by the wider profession has led to misconceptions and misunderstandings of what exactly the p-factor is in the context of probabilistic damage stability calculations. This is evidenced by the fact that the same original damage breach distributions, derived in Project HARDER, based on largely cargo ships with the age spread over the last three decades of the previous century, are still being used today for all ship types, including modern passenger ships. Filling this gap, a new database for passenger ships developed in the EC-funded Project FLARE, is briefly presented, leading to new damage breach distributions specifically for passenger ships. It is believed that this paper will throw considerable light in enhancing understanding on the p-factor, which has been cluttered with unnecessary complexity from the outset.<sep>The concept and design of ammonia as a marine fuel are still in the embryonic stage which requires an in-depth investigation of its applicability in terms of its safety and potential risks, both in the design and operational phases of a ship's lifecycle. The paper examines and compares the state-of-the-art safety regulations, rules, standards and guidelines relevant to ammonia-fuelled ships available in various classification societies reports and international regulations such as the IGF codes and summarises their gaps and limitations. The paper critically analyses three major hazards namely toxicity, chemical corrosion, fire and explosion and their potential impact on the human, environment and ship in the event of ammonia leakage. Various hazardous areas considered include ammonia leakage at the bunkering station, fuel preparation room, engine room and storage room and its impact on the ship's general arrangement. In addition, this study reviews and discusses various qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods employed in ships using low-flashpoint fuels and their relevance and potential suitability for ships powered by ammonia. The paper concludes with important findings and recommendations to aid designers, operators, safety experts, and policymakers in the further development of safety within the framework of risk assessment and management. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the safety considerations of using ammonia as a marine fuel and highlights the need for further research and development in this area.<sep>Offshore installations are designed to withstand against potential collisions from offshore supply vessels (OSV). Quantitative risk assessment (QRA) provides an overall picture of expected collision frequencies and consequences for the design life of a platform and subsequently estimates the damage repair cost. However, the main challenge of the QRA study is how well various uncertainties are implemented into the model. This study aimed to introduce and demonstrate an advanced and efficient QRA model for the collision between an OSV and a jacket type offshore platform. A set of fifty collision scenarios were selected using probabilistic sampling techniques, and vessel motion analyses were performed to determine collision load characteristics. Extensive nonlinear structural crashworthiness analyses were conducted using advanced computational modelling techniques, and the repair cost of the damaged brace and column members were calculated. Probability exceedance diagrams were established for different consequence parameters, and asset risks were calculated. A comparison study of the design values of damage parameters and repair costs were carried out in association with the NORSOK and HSE risk acceptance criteria. A sensitivity study was carried out to study the effects of various collision load parameters on the structural consequences. The methods and insights developed in this study could be applied to both new and existing offshore platforms and practically useful for the platform owners to aid in their decision-making process towards the risk-based safety analysis of offshore platforms.<sep>An offshore mooring system stations a ship-shaped offshore installation in place while withstanding incoming loads from the marine environment with short-term and long-term uncertainties. This study aims to develop a novel framework for analysing the loads on floating systems, namely mooring line tension, mooring line fatigue damage, and hull bending moment, as a function of the mooring layout design variables and environmental random variables. The nonlinear influence of those variables is assessed by means of advanced techniques using response charts, response divergence charts, and Sobol's total-effect sensitivity indexes. The developed procedure includes a probabilistic selection of mooring scenarios, station-keeping numerical analyses, and metamodel selection to define input loads. An example of a hypothetical floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit with taut legs in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the procedure. The details of the computations are documented, and the findings show that the mooring line top-tension has a high total-effect index for the wave-induced bending moment and the total mooring line tension, whereas the fatigue damage is mostly affected by the chain diameter. The results of this research offer useful insights to designers and propose the use of a surrogate model to be used in the reliability-based design of mooring systems. • A novel framework to assess the effect of design variables on the mooring lines loads of floating systems. • Nonlinear behaviour of input loads described using response and divergence charts. • High total-effect indexes for most influencing parameters. • Loads predicted by ANN and Kriging models. • The applied example includes a hypothetical FPSO with taut mooring legs operating in the Gulf of Mexico region.<sep>The aim of this study is to establish an innovative method for predicting wave-induced hull girder loads acting on ship-shaped offshore installations. Unlike in trading ships, the determination of hull girder loads of ship-shaped offshore installations must consider site-specific environmental conditions. However, the accurate determination of wave-induced loads is not straightforward owing to uncertainties in the ocean environmental conditions and location-dependent complexities, among other factors. This study proposes a probabilistic approach to determine the site-specific design values of wave-induced loads acting on ship-shaped offshore installations that also accounts for the effects of mooring system type. Six target regions – the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, western coast of Africa, the eastern coast of South America, southeastern coast of Asia and northwestern coast of Australia – were studied to compare the results corresponding to various sea states. A set of wave scenarios representing all possible wave events for each target region were selected using the Latin hypercube sampling technique. To demonstrate this method, the design values of the wave-induced vertical bending moments were determined for a very large crude oil carrier (VLCC)-class structure with a hypothetical floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit. The effects of the mooring system type (e.g., single-point mooring versus spread mooring) on the wave-induced hull girder loads of the ship-shaped offshore installations were also evaluated. The validation of the developed method was made by comparison with existing results in the literature, its novelty is associated with a new methodology that can accurately determine wave-induced hull girder loads of ship-shaped offshore installations taking into account the effects of site-specific ocean environmental conditions and mooring system type, and its main contribution to the industry is to provide core technology for the safe and economical design of ship-shaped offshore hull structures.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Graphical user interface<sep>Mass flow<sep>Hull<sep>Dimension (graph theory)<sep>Turbine<sep>Frame (networking)<sep>Permanent magnet synchronous generator<sep>Fuzzy logic<sep>Control (management)<sep>Coal<sep>Global Positioning System<sep>Remotely operated underwater vehicle<sep>Visual servoing<sep>Control system<sep>Tracking (education)<sep>Fault (geology)<sep>European union<sep>Inertial measurement unit<sep>The Internet<sep>Core (optical fiber)<sep>Jacobian matrix and determinant<sep>Interface (matter)<sep>Inverse<sep>Controller (irrigation)<sep>Software<sep>USB<sep>Submarine pipeline<sep>Wind power<sep>Network packet<sep>Pulverized coal-fired boiler<sep>Cement<sep>User interface<sep>Fuzzy control system<sep>Modal<sep>Kinematics<sep>Troubleshooting<sep>Power optimizer<sep>Upload<sep>Seabed<sep>Robotics<sep>Latency (audio)<sep>Robot<sep>Field-programmable gate array<sep>Photovoltaic system<sep>Underwater<sep>Fault tolerance<sep>Control theory (sociology)<sep>Docking (animal)<sep>Offshore wind power<sep>Machine vision<sep>Remotely operated vehicle<sep>Inertial navigation system<sep>Advanced Encryption Standard<sep>Automation<sep>Kalman filter<sep>Subsea<sep>Remote control<sep>Agile software development<sep>Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system<sep>Encryption<sep>Inverse kinematics<sep>Visualization<sep>Tracking system<sep>Internet of Things</keyword><title>Autonomous Tracking System of a Moving Target for Underwater Operations of Work-class ROVs<sep>A Monocular Hybrid Visual Servoing Controller for Underwater Inspection on Work-class ROVs<sep>Vision based autonomous docking for work class ROVs<sep>Robotic Ship Hull Inspection For Damage Repair<sep>LabVIEW-FPGA based implementation of an Authenticated Encryption core<sep>Independent Tether Management Nodes for Subsea Vehicles in Complex Fields<sep>Multi-Modal Supervision Interface Concept for Marine Systems<sep>Preliminary Study of a Novel Magnetic Sensor for Safety in Industrial Robotics<sep>A New Control Algorithm for Directly Interconnected Offshore Wind Turbine Generators<sep>Neuro-Fuzzy Dynamic Position Prediction for Autonomous Work-Class ROV Docking<sep>Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Network Enhanced Automatic Visual Servoing Algorithm for ROV Manipulators<sep>Vision-Based Localization System Suited to Resident Underwater Vehicles<sep>Identification and Control of Precalciner in the Cement Plant<sep>Application of Thruster Fault-Tolerant Control System based on the Hybrid Method for Control Allocation in Real-World Environment<sep>Control Algorithm for Parallel Connected Offshore Wind Turbine Generators<sep>Inverse kinematics of a subsea constrained manipulator based on FABRIK-R<sep>A Low-Cost Remote Solar Energy Monitoring System for a Buoyed IoT Ocean Observation Platform<sep>Geometric Insight into the Control Allocation Problem for Open-Frame ROVs and Visualisation of Solution<sep>A Practical Comparison of GEO and LEO Satellite Communication Systems for Remote Presence Control of an ROV<sep>Fully Automatic Visual Servoing Control for Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems Based on a Heuristic Inverse Kinematics<sep>Real-Time Secure/Unsecure Video Latency Measurement/Analysis with FPGA-Based Bump-in-the-Wire Security</title><abstract>This paper presents an autonomous tracking system of a moving target Underwater Operations of Work-class ROVs using a single camera. A computer vision system is developed to detect fiducial markers attached to the target and estimate its position in the global frame, representing it in the latitude and longitude coordinates for the global positioning controller of the ROV. Real-world environmental tests consisting of using a workclass ROV to autonomously tracking a smaller ROV is presented and results demonstrate the feasibility of the developed system.<sep>This paper presents research and development for autonomous ROV manipulation systems with vision servoing in dynamic underwater conditions. Underwater inspection operations are performed by work-class ROVs equipped with robotic manipulators. The ROV generally travel at pre-planned paths extracting features from the environment, usually detected by a visual sensor. A monocular hybrid position based visual servoing (PBVS) system for underwater inspection on Work-class ROVs with a camera mounted on the manipulator and other on the top of the ROV is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified through experiments carried out on real-world environmental tests consisting on using a work-class ROV to autonomously inspect a wall with 10 fiducial markers.<sep>This paper presents autonomous docking of an industry standard work-class ROV to both static and dynamic docking station (Tether Management System — TMS) using visual based pose estimation techniques. This is the first time autonomous docking to a dynamic docking station has been presented. Furthermore, the presented system does not require a specially designed docking station but uses a conventional cage type TMS. The paper presents and discusses real-world environmental tests successfully completed during January 2019 in the North Atlantic Ocean. To validate the performance of the system, a commercial state of the art underwater navigation system has been used. The results demonstrate a significant advancement in resident ROV automation and capabilities, and represents a system which can be retrofitted to the current ROV fleet.<sep>In this paper, we investigate the methods to be used in the inspection of damaged ship hulls in water at sea, as part of the European Union (EU) Robotic Survey, Repair and Agile Manufacture (RESURGAM) Project. Employing underwater robotics equipped with camera or laser sensors, along with robust control and positioning systems, 3D models of the damaged section(s) can be produced with a goal of providing sufficient information for the subsequent design of repair patch(es), and ultimately the application of this repair to the ship. This work will allow damaged ships at sea to seek repair without the need for access to a dry dock. Preliminary results from recent field operations are included in this paper, with further field research to be carried out later this year.<sep>The IoT makes communication possible between anything and adds the dimension “Any THING communication” to the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), which has already provided the “Any TIME” and the “Any PLACE” communication. With the impressive growth forecasts, the IoT is raising many challenges including information security and privacy issues, these need to be resolved to get maximum potential benefits from it. Observers see the IoT as a revolutionary fully interconnected `smart' world of progress, but other thinking about the IoT is that it represents a darker world of surveillance, privacy and security violations, because in the IoT environment `Everything' will be accessible through the Internet. This work presents a LabVIEW-FPGA based implementation of authenticated encryption, which can be used in an IoT environment using BITW technique.<sep>This paper presents a Tether Multipoint Management System (TMMS) for a Resident Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in offshore operations. Operating close to structure or seabed. Boulders etc tether management is critical to ensure the safety and effectiveness of operations without tether entanglement. The proposed TMMS is composed of one or more Independent Tether Management Nodes (ITMN) enabling the ROV to move freely and autonomously around offshore structures while minimizing the risk of tether entanglement. The ITMN can use a combination of active thrusters (axial, lateral, and vertical) and passive (buoyancy and fin) control to achieve the necessary degrees of freedom and an onboard battery for power. The proposed system expands the operational capability of the ROV, allowing it to perform tasks not possible beforehand, saving time and increasing efficiency.<sep>With increased orientation towards fleet operations, new technologies to improve autonomy and connectivity are needed. Most vehicles already come with mission planning and execution capabilities, and all state data is available remotely. With more autonomy, operators take on the supervision role for multiple vehicles. However, managing multiple vehicles in real-time requires supervisory interfaces that will reduce sensory overload. This presents a concept of an immersive user interface for supervision of marine systems. The augmented virtuality system provides a remote telepresence for operators with real-time interaction capabilities. The system focuses on providing situation awareness while maintaining operator capabilities. Data are streamed into the Unity3D interface through dedicated plugins, allowing two-way communication with LabView. Data is distilled into visual clues, while sound and speech recognition are employed to lessen the visual strain and improve interaction.<sep>In this paper a novel magnetic sensor for industrial robotics is presented. The main aim of the sensor is to detect the presence of human beings in order to avoid the collision between workers and the robot. The sensor consists in such an artificial skin to conform at the robot shape, made by several turns of a wire covered by a dielectric. The sensor made in this way has no exposed metal parts, so it is safe from an electrical point of view and has no tips that could be caught up by surrounding objects. This sensor in mainly based to the magnetic field variation due to the presence of the target. At first, a laboratory prototype of this sensor was built to perform a preliminary set of measurements. Furtherly a prototype implementation was realized and tested in a realistic scenario.<sep>A new control algorithm for Directly Interconnected offshore Wind Turbines with permanent magnet synchronous Generators (DIWTG) is presented. In the DΓWTG offshore wind park configuration, Wind Turbines with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (WTPMSG) are directly connected to the offshore AC collection grid without using a power converter. The offshore AC collection grid is then connected, via a transformer, to the offshore AC transmission grid. In order to achieve maximum power point tracking, the (collective) speed of DΓWTGs is controlled by an onshore back to back converter. By measuring the active power and speed of the permanent magnet generators, wind speed at each turbine is estimated and used for calculation of the reference speed of WTPMSGs. Voltage control at the power converter side is performed in a way which allow the DΓWTGs to be operated at a constant V/f where the maximum resultant frequency at nominal wind speed is 16.67 Hz.<sep>This paper presents a docking station heave motion prediction method for dynamic remotely operated vehicle (ROV) docking, based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Due to the limited power onboard the subsea vehicle, high hydrodynamic drag forces, and inertia, work-class ROVs are often unable to match the heave motion of a docking station suspended from a surface vessel. Therefore, the docking relies entirely on the experience of the ROV pilot to estimate heave motion, and on human-in-the-loop ROV control. However, such an approach is not available for autonomous docking. To address this problem, an ANFIS-based method for prediction of a docking station heave motion is proposed and presented. The performance of the network was evaluated on real-world reference trajectories recorded during offshore trials in the North Atlantic Ocean during January 2019. The hardware used during the trials included a work-class ROV with a cage type TMS, deployed using an A-frame launch and recovery system.<sep>This paper presents research and development for achieving advanced ROV manipulation systems with vision based servo control capable of being operated by pilots with auto assist in the dynamic subsea conditions. Underwater inspection and intervention operations are performed by work-class ROVs equipped with robotic manipulators. A standard offshore oil and gas setup includes a human pilot utilising telemanipulation technology to operate both vehicle and manipulators based on the work-site visual feedback provided by camera and sonar systems. For challenging applications in waves or currents where target devices are in motion a new approach is required. A position based visual servoing (PBVS) algorithm designed to follow a moving target with an underwater manipulator is proposed. The developed algorithm integrates Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) network framework for target motion prediction. The effectiveness of the developed software is verified through a series of experiments carried out with an off-the-shelf industrial hydraulic subsea manipulator in the laboratory conditions.<sep>In recent years, we have seen significant interest in the use of permanently deployed resident robotic vehicles for commercial inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) activities. This paper presents a concept and demonstration, through offshore trials, of a low-cost, low-maintenance, navigational marker that can eliminate drift in vehicle INS solution when the vehicle is close to the IMR target. The subsea localisation marker system is fixed on location on the resident field asset and is used in on-vehicle machine vision algorithms for pose estimation and facilitation of a high-resolution world coordinate frame registration with a high refresh rate. This paper presents evaluation of the system during trials in the North Atlantic Ocean during January 2019. System performances and propagation of position error is inspected and estimated, and the effect of intermittent visual based position update to Kalman filter and onboard INS solution is discussed. The paper presents experimental results of the commercial state-of-the-art inertial navigation system operating in the pure inertial mode for comparison.<sep>Identification and control of precalciner in the cement production process with the increased use of alternative fuels is presented in this paper. The model of the system consists of the precalciner model as well as of pulverized coal transport model and alternative fuel transport model. The manipulated variable in the precalciner system is pulverized coal, while the alternative fuel calorific value change and the alternative fuel mass flow change are the main disturbances. Outputs of the precalciner model are the precalciner output gas temperature, as a controlled variable, and concentration of CO as measured variable. During the identification process, raw meal mass flow and primary secondary and tertiary air flows are considered to be constant. Based on identified model of the precalciner and the fuel transport model, the mixed logical dynamical controller is designed and implemented at Cement Factory Lukavac (Bosnia and Herzegovina). The mixed logical dynamical controller is realized on the cRIO 9014 real-time controller using LabVIEW (G) programming language. The real-time responses indicate improvements in precalciner temperature control while keeping reasonable low frequency and intensity of CO peaks.<sep>Fault-tolerant control system for marine robots, developed by researchers at Centre for Robotics & Intelligent Systems (CRIS), University of Limerick, utilises the hybrid method for control allocation, based on the integration of the pseudoinverse and the fixed-point iteration method. The algorithm is implemented as a two-step process. In the first step, the pseudoinverse solution is found, and the feasibility of the solution is examined analysing its components. If violation of actuator constraint(s) is detected, the fixed-point iteration method is activated in the second step. In this way, the hybrid method for control allocation can allocate the exact solution, optimal in the l2 sense, inside the entire attainable command set. This solution minimises a control energy cost function, the most suitable criteria for underwater applications. The performance of the thruster fault-tolerant control system has been validated during the research cruise CE19001, where the work-class ROV Étaín, deployed from support vessel Celtic Explorer via Tether Management System (TMS), successfully performed several complex subsea tasks with a faulty horizontal thruster. This paper describes the algorithm, provides geometric interpretation and presents the results from field trials.<sep>A control algorithm for Parallel Connected Offshore Wind Turbines with permanent magnet synchronous Generators (PCOWTG) is presented in this paper. The algorithm estimates the optimal collective speed of turbines based on the estimated mechanical power of wind turbines without direct measurement of wind speed. In the proposed topology of the wind farm, direct-drive Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) is connected to variable low-frequency AC Collection Grids (ACCG) without the use of individual power converters. The ACCG is connected to a variable low-frequency offshore AC transmission grid using a step-up transformer. In order to achieve optimum wind power extraction, the collective speed of the WTGs is controlled by a single onshore Back to Back converter (B2B). The voltage control system of the B2B converter adjusts voltage by keeping a constant Volt/Hz ratio, ensuring constant magnetic flux of electromagnetic devices regardless of changing system frequency. With the use of PI pitch compensators, wind power extraction for each wind turbine is limited within rated WTG power limits. Lack of load damping in offshore wind parks can result in oscillatory instability of PCOWTG. In this paper, damping torque is increased using P pitch controllers at each WTG that work in parallel with PI pitch compensators.<sep>Although underwater manipulators are considered the most suitable tools for executing many subsea intervention operations, they are an example of robots not designed for autonomous tasks. The subsea manipulator Schilling Titan 2, for instance, is composed of a sequence of constrained joints that makes impossible finding a closed-form analytical solution for its inverse kinematics. For this reason, numerical methods have normally been used. Nevertheless, these methods typically result in high computational load and may need many iterations to find a solution. FABRIK is an inverse kinematics approach which has as main advantages a fast convergence and a low computational cost, avoiding matrix inversion and being robust to singularities. However, the constraints imposed by the joints of the Titan 2 manipulator also makes impossible solving its inverse kinematics using FABRIK. A recent extension of FABRIK, named FABRIK-R, presents a solution for this problem. Therefore, this paper proposes to overcome the mentioned issues by solving the inverse kinematics of a high constrained subsea manipulator based on FABRIK-R and presents a comparison between this solution and a classical approach based on a second-order pseudo-inverse Jacobian. The advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated in simulation experiments, and its feasibility is demonstrated in real experiments in manipulation tasks performed in dry lab conditions.<sep>This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a low-cost Energy Monitoring System used to remotely monitor the condition of autonomous power generators (i.e. solar panels) for Marine IoT applications. The purpose of the device is to expedite remote troubleshooting, highlight potential problems and identify the need for service/recovery. It consists of a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera, an 8 megapixel video/stills camera, Raspberry pi Mini-PC, two VE.Direct® to USB interfaces, UHF transceiver, GPS and a power supply. Its method of non-invasive testing involves the transmission of GPS position and time stamped images, as well as infrared images of the Photovoltaic (PV) panels ashore by Slow Scan TV (SSTV). The image is modulated on a UHF carrier wave and received at an internet gateway using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver on a parent buoy. It is then transmitted ashore for demodulation via TCP link across a subsea Ethernet cable. Invasive monitoring is carried out by attaching a USB interface to the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Solar Charge Controllers on the buoy. A Linux shell script run on the Mini-PC logs values such as PV Voltage, Battery Voltage, Charge State and Daily Energy Yield from the PV panels. The device aims to reduce costs and downtime, enabling remote decisions to be made, working towards achieving energy continuum.<sep>The overall control system for an open-frame Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is typically built from three subsystems: guidance, navigation and control (GNC). The control allocation plays a vital role in the control subsystem. Typically, open-frame underwater vehicles have p actuators (thrusters) for the motion in the horizontal plane, and the control allocation problem, in this case, is very complex and hard to visualise, because the normalised constrained control subset is a p-dimensional unit cube. The aim of this paper is to give a clear picture and a geometric interpretation of the problem and to introduce a hybrid method, based on the integration of a weighted pseudoinverse and the fixed-point method. The main idea of the hybrid method is visualised, and the deep geometric insight is provided using a “virtual” ROV in low-dimensional control spaces, including visualisation of the attainable command set, solution lines, control energy spheres and the role of pseudoinverse and fixed-point iterations. The same concepts are then extended to higher-dimensional cases, for open-frame ROV with four X-shaped (vectored) horizontal thrusters, which is one of the most common thruster configurations for commercial ROVs. The proposed hybrid method has been developed, integrated into a generic fault-tolerant ROV control system and evaluated in virtual and real-world environments off the west coast of Ireland using observation-class ROV Latis and work-class ROV Étaín.<sep>This paper describes an ROV remote presence control exercise conducted over both Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellite Communications links. Its purpose was to investigate and compare the reliability, latency and available bandwidth provided by both systems for the chosen application. The ROV used is operated by the Centre for Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CRIS), University of Limerick, Ireland. It was deployed in December 2022 from the Irish Marine Institute’s Research Vessel (RV) 'Tom Crean', off the south coast of Ireland and was controlled by a PC running OceanRINGS smart software control system. The GEO Satellite Communications link used was the vessel’s VSAT system, and the electronic phased array antenna, router and mobile phone hotspot provided the link to the Starlink LEO constellation. A remote operator located in Co. Sligo, Ireland, accessed the OceanRINGS control PC across a TeamViewer link. Upload and Download connection speeds and Latencies between the OceanRINGS PC and onshore servers were recorded. A series of exercises were then performed, remotely altering the heading and depth of the ROV. Wireshark network protocol analyser was used to capture packet data from the network interfaces throughout the exercises. On analysis, it was found that the use of the LEO satellite link significantly reduced latency when compared to the GEO link, while transfer speeds increased by a factor of 13.78 (download) and 7.71 (upload). The exercise demonstrated that both satellite connections could facilitate high-level remote presence control of the ROV.<sep>Abstract The use of underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) equipped with cameras has gained significant attention due to their capacity to perform underwater tasks autonomously. However, controlling both the manipulator and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) based on the vision system information is not an easy task, especially in situations where the vehicle cannot be parked/held stationary. Most of the existing approaches work based on complex matrix calculations for the inverse kinematics (IK), which can lead to high computational costs and the need to deal with singularity problems. A problem arises when the amount of time needed to calculate the UVMS configuration can result in reduced frequency of target pose estimation, beyond the point where the target has moved out of the camera field of view. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous visual servoing approach for UVMS, including an extension of a heuristic technique named M-FABRIK (Mobile - Forward and Backward Reaching IK) to calculate the UVMS inverse kinematics in a simple and fast way. This approach aims to control both the configuration of the manipulator and ROV position in order to allow underwater intervention in situations where the ROV cannot be parked/held stationary. This solution allows the vehicle to be positioned according to additional criteria, besides avoiding matrix inversion and being robust to singularities. Trials have been performed with a manipulator mounted on a work-class ROV for an autonomous underwater monitoring task and results demonstrate a simple and fast approach, which is able to set the configuration of the manipulator as well as the ROV for visual servoing applications in real-time, such as for monitoring, tracking and intervention tasks underwater.<sep>With the growth of the internet of things (IoT), many challenges like information security and privacy, interoperability/standard, and regulatory and legal issues are arising. This work focused on the information security issue, which is one of the primary challenges faced by connected systems that needs to be resolved without impairing system behaviour. Information, which is made available on the Internet by the things, varies from insensitive information (e.g., readings from outdoor temperature sensors) to extremely sensitive information (e.g., video stream from a camera) and needs to be secured over the Internet. Things which utilise cameras as a source of information pertain to a subclass of the IoT called IoVT (internet of video things). This paper presents secured and unsecured video latency measurement results over the Internet for a marine ROV (remotely operated vehicle). A LabVIEW field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-based bump-in-the-wire (BITW) secure core is used to provide an AES (advanced encryption standard)-enabled security feature on the video stream of an IoVT node (ROV equipped with a live-feed camera). The designed LabVIEW-based software architecture provides an option to enable/disable the AES encryption for the video transmission. The latency effects of embedding encryption on the stream with real-time constraints are measured and presented. It is found that the encryption mechanism used does not greatly influence the video feedback performance of the observed IoVT node, which is critical for real-time secure video communication for ROV remote control and piloting. The video latency measurement results are taken using 128, 256 and 512 bytes block lengths of AES for both H.264 and MJPEG encoding schemes transmitted over both TCP and UDP transmission protocols. The latency measurement is performed in two scenarios (i.e., with matching equipment and different equipment on either end of the transmission).</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/72540/professorship-in-water-and-environmental-engineering-hydroinformatics/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5010477889", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5047662350", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description, particularly in hydroinformatics, water and wastewater systems, and large-scale research projects, while Candidate B's expertise is more focused on robotics, control systems, and underwater operations, which are less relevant to the professorship in hydroinformatics.\nPreferred: A\nConfidence score: 100", "created": 1737539547, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 69, "prompt_tokens": 9420, "total_tokens": 9489, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 9356}, "comparison": "Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description, particularly in hydroinformatics, water and wastewater systems, and large-scale research projects, while Candidate B's expertise is more focused on robotics, control systems, and underwater operations, which are less relevant to the professorship in hydroinformatics.", "preferred": "A", "confidence_score": 100, "passage_rank1": 15, "passage_rank2": 66}

Business owners, though, might be reluctant to make investments in process innovation unless they serve a pure profit motive. While not guided by altruistic intentions, the owners might nonetheless see a strategic benefit in providing their managers with remuneration incentives supported by public commitments to increase innovation effort for more efficient, lean and sustainable operations. We model such a possibility amongst producers controlling the supply of essential complementary components that go into the assembly of competitively produced composite finished goods. We demonstrate the ruinous effect of independent strategic delegation to managers of powerful complementary producers. Instead, collaboration amongst the owners of the complementary producers to establish common managerial incentives can increase innovative effort to raise efficiency that benefits the whole industry supply chain, end consumers, and social welfare. Government-backed voluntary agreements with sector-wide commitments may be helpful in encouraging process innovation to support lean supply chains and sustainability.<sep>In recent years, coproduction technology has been developed and adopted by many third-party coproduct manufacturers (CMs). Coproducts made of leftover materials from traditional manufacturing are strongly attractive to green consumers who are willing to pay a price premium for environmental protection. However, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) might hesitate to adopt coproduction technology because the coproduct cannibalizes the sales of their traditional products. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretical model to investigate the economic and environmental implications of coproduction that can be leveraged by one OEM or one CM. We find that, from the OEM’s perspective, the dominant strategy can be OEM coproduction, CM coproduction, or No coproduction, which is contingent on the demand from green consumers and the supply of raw materials. We also find that the size of green consumers and the unit cost of raw materials have non-monotone impacts on the CM’s profit. Interestingly, an enlarging size of green consumers might hurt the CM, while an increasing cost of raw materials might benefit the CM. Although coproduction recovers the value of leftover materials, the adoption of coproduction technology increases the total material consumption and the total material waste when the unit cost of raw materials is sufficiently high, making the environment worse off.<sep>Emerging economies, e.g. India, China and Brazil etc., face challenges to adopt food safety (FS) practices in their food supply chains. Considering food industry’s operations and processes, this study identifies 25 challenges to the FS initiatives involving the opinions of practitioners from six major Indian food producers and academic experts. The challenges are grouped into five categories, viz. organisational, government and policy, global, knowledge and financial. We identify the best and worst challenges to the FS initiatives along with causality among them using combined Best Worst Method (BWM) and ‘Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory’ (DEMATEL) approaches. BWM prioritises these challenges, while DEMATEL identifies causal relationship maps for the prioritised challenges. The BWM results demonstrate that the government and policy related challenges are the key challenges followed by the organisational, global, knowledge and financial related challenges. The DEMATEL results exhibit the organisational, government and policy, and global related challenges as the cause group challenges. The knowledge and financial related challenges represent the effect group challenges. Mitigation of these challenges inherently necessitates stakeholders’ involvement in the food supply chains. We identify constructs for food safety initiatives policy in the emerging economies to raise public awareness while encouraging greater collaboration and efficiency in food supply chains to help achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for securing food for everyone. The results of the study offer guidance and deeper insights to supply chain managers about synergy requirements between the government policymakers and key players of the industry in the emerging economies.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Capital cost<sep>Fossil fuel<sep>Oil field<sep>Upstream (networking)<sep>Energy intensity<sep>Return on investment<sep>Enhanced oil recovery<sep>Energy (signal processing)<sep>Submarine pipeline<sep>Drilling<sep>Well control<sep>Range (aeronautics)<sep>Consolidation (business)<sep>Dispose pattern<sep>Barrel (horology)<sep>Electric potential energy<sep>Workover<sep>Investment (military)<sep>Production (economics)</keyword><title>Practical Applications of Net Energy Analysis of Upstream Oil and Gas Processes<sep>Detailed Energy Accounting of Electrical Submersible Pumping Systems<sep>Chemical Sand Consolidation Design in Jasmine Field: Lessons Learned and Critical Success Factors from an Operator Point of View<sep>Lifecycle Energy Accounting of Three Small Offshore Oil Fields<sep>Application of Techno-Economic Energy Intensity Ratios in the Oil and Gas Industry</title><abstract>Abstract Net energy analysis (NEA) has traditionally been utilized by nonindustry actors, such as academics, economists, and regulators. It has not been widely accepted as a beneficial method within the oil and gas industry with regard to oil extraction systems. This research describes several NEA metrics, such at the energy return on energy investment (EROI), and the energy intensity ratio (EIR), and suggests several practical benefits to oil and gas owner/operators of applying them. The benefits are primarily realized by integrating NEA into economic analysis at the field level, facility level, and well level. The high level impact of energy on both capital and operational (OPEX and CAPEX) expenditures is explored. The case is made that NEA can be used to illuminate the drivers behind energy intensive oil and gas extraction processes, and thus can be used to reveal important economic risks and opportunities.<sep>The concept of energy return on investment (EROI) is applied to a set of electrical submersible pumps (ESPs) installed on a small offshore platform by conducting a detailed energy accounting of each ESP. This information is used to quantify the energy losses and efficiencies of each ESP system as well as the EROI of the lifting process (EROILifting), which is derived by dividing the energy out of each well, which is the chemical energy of the crude oil produced, by the energy consumed by each ESP system and by the surface equipment used to dispose of the well’s produced water. The resulting EROILifting values range from 93 to 565, with a corresponding energy intensity range of 18.3 to 3.0 kWh/barrel of crude. The energy consumed by each well is also is used to calculate the lifting costs, which is the incremental cost of producing an additional barrel of crude oil, which range from 0.64 to 3.90 USD/barrel of crude. The lifting costs are entirely comprised of procured diesel fuel, since there is no natural gas available on the platform to be used as fuel. Electrical efficiencies range from 0.60 to 0.80, while Hydraulic efficiencies range from 0.12 to 0.56. The overall ESP efficiencies range from 0.09 to 0.39, with the largest losses occurring in the hydraulic system, particularly within the ESP pump itself. Improvement of pump efficiencies is the only practical option to improve the overall ESP system efficiencies. Other losses within the electrical and hydraulic systems present few opportunities for improvement.<sep>Abstract The Jasmine oil field, in the Gulf of Thailand, has several pools of unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs. Multi-zone completion is usually deployed in these reservoirs, however, sand control in this completion type could be a challenge. Several sand control techniques were evaluated and the most promising strategy was found to be chemical sand consolidation treatment. In the design phase, the most critical challenge was to determine the optimal and safe chemical recipe and placement technique. A single chemical recipe optimized for all of the reservoirs was achieved, yielding an unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of at least 500 psi while retaining a permeability of 40%. Bullheading was selected as the placement technique. To minimize contamination of the chemical with annulus fluid, we designed to shorten the distance between the packers of each completion zone. Cut-to-release packers were used instead of pull-to-release packers to mitigate the concern of unwittingly unsettling the packers. A risk assessment was conducted to cover all aspects of the job. High risk activity like pumping flammable fluids at high pressure was specifically singled out and special mitigation was put in place to ensure a safe execution of the activity. Some other mitigations such as minimizing nearby hot surface areas, real-time monitoring of oxygen levels, and purging the mixing system with CO2 were also considered. This paper provides a case study for chemical sand consolidation treatment from the view of an oil company and covers the full lifecycle of the application from concept selection to the finalized procedure, taking into account both technical and operational considerations. This research contributes to the public body of knowledge within the oil and gas industry with regards to an emerging technique for sand consolidation.<sep>Small oil fields are expected to play an increasingly prominent role in the delivery of global crude oil production. As such, the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) parameter for three small offshore fields are investigated following a well-documented methodology, which is comprised of a “bottom-up” estimate for lifting and drilling energy and a “top-down” estimate for construction energy. EROI is the useable energy output divided by the applied energy input, and in this research, subscripts for “lifting”, “drilling”, and “construction” are used to differentiate the types of input energies accounted for in the EROI ratio. The EROILifting time series data for all three fields exhibits a decreasing trend with values that range from more than 300 during early life to less than 50 during latter years. The EROILifting parameter appears to follow an exponentially decreasing trend, rather than a linear trend, which is aligned with an exponential decline of production. EROILifting is also found to be inversely proportional to the lifting costs, as calculated in USD/barrel of crude oil. Lifting costs are found to range from 0.5 dollars per barrel to 4.5 dollars per barrel. The impact of utilizing produced gas is clearly beneficial and can lead to a reduction of lifting costs by as much as 50% when dual fuel generators are employed, and more than 90% when gas driven generators are utilized. Drilling energy is found to decrease as the field ages, due to a reduction in drilling intensity after the initial production wells are drilled. The drilling energy as a percentage of the yearly energy applied is found to range from 3% to 8%. As such, the EROILifting+Drilling value for all three fields approaches EROILifting as the field life progresses and the drilling intensity decreases. The construction energy is found to range from 25% to 63% of the total applied energy over the life of the field.<sep>Abstract Net Energy Analysis (NEA) provides essential information and insight that can be used to support field level decision making by oil and gas owner/operators. It contains important information that compliments traditional field level analytical methods that take into account operational and capital expense (OPEX and CAPEX) estimates, discounted cash flows, production volumes and recoverable reserves. The objective of this research is to describe practical methods of conducting field-level NEA and demonstrate the benefits via thought-provoking hypothetical case studies. One way to integrate NEA and economics is through the use of Energy Intensity Ratios (EIR) at the field level, which focuses on the ratio of the energy costs to the energy intensity of a field, two critical factors affecting both a field's economics and environmental impact. To begin with, this ratio is developed for a number of diverse hypothetical fields and provides an insightful comparison of the underlying economic drivers of different production schemes. Sensitivities on the underlying energetic drivers of a field are explored, taking into account the following recovery methods: (1) water flooding with downhole pumps for production; (2) water flooding with gas lift for production; and (3) steam injection with downhole pumps for production. Additionally, the EIR concept is applied to three small oil fields located in the Gulf of Thailand, with differing energy intensities and fuel sources. The three actual fields all employ water flooding, or water disposal, with downhole pumps for production, which makes for an interesting comparison with the first hypothetical case. The field level EIR provides an interesting perspective on the economic drivers of the field and clearly differentiates between a production scheme in which the fuel is inexpensive, e.g. from unmarketable production fluids, and the energy intensity of production is low, to a field with higher fuel costs, e.g. imported power or liquid fuels, and a corresponding high energy intensity of production.

An Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model of the test machine is first used to analyse the effects of rotor fault on the torque signal, and characterise the fault induced UMP effects. An experimental study is then performed on a purpose-built laboratory test rig for different demagnetisation fault severities in a number of operating points in the nominal operating range.

However, the nature of the electromagnetic field environment inside HVDC valve halls presents a challenge for the operation of traditional off-shelf inspection robots. High electrostatic interference to inspection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been studied in Part A of this paper. In Part B, the impact of the external magnetic field on the operation of an inspection quadcopter‘s propulsion motors is assessed. An experimental method is proposed to identify the maximum magnetic field tolerable by off-the-shelf quadcopter motors. The reported method can be used to test commercial off-the-shelf quadcopter motors to identify their suitability for use in HVDC valve halls inspection robots.

A range of PM uniform and local demagnetisation fault scenarios at different severity conditions are examined. The aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which different modes of PM demagnetisation could be distinguished by inspecting the spectral signature patterns these generate in the stator current signal. To this end, a generalised mathematical characterisation of PM fault spectral signature in the stator current is examined and a 2D FEA software used to establish a model of the studied PM machine design. The FEA model was employed to predict the current signal spectral signature patterns of a range of different PM demagnetisation faults.

Within an optimisation process this is further compounded by the high degrees of freedom to define the geometry and the requirement for 3D computations at both design and off-design conditions.

The current paper describes wind tunnel experiments studying how incoming Mach number and engine mass-flow rate influence the aerodynamics governing external fan cowl flow separation in both these windmilling scenarios. A transonic region may form on the forebody surface if the engine becomes inoperative during take-off climb out, with peak Mach number up to 1.2.

In order to achieve these goals, the next generation of Ultra-High Bypass Ratio engines are expected to increase propulsive efficiency through operating at reduced specific thrust. Consequently, there is an expected increase in fan diameter and the associated potential penalties of nacelle drag and weight.

There is, however, limited experimental data of flows of this type to reveal the dominant flow physics and to guide the development of vortex models. To this end, the evolution of wing-tip vortices inside a range of streamtube contractions has been measured using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. A semi-empirical model has been applied to provide new insight on the role of vorticity diffusion during the intensification process. The analysis demonstrates that for mild flow contractions, vorticity diffusion<sep>Future civil aero-engines are likely to operate with higher bypass-ratios (BPR) than current power-plants to improve propulsive efficiency and reduce specific thrust. This will probably be accompanied by an increase of fan diameter and size of the power plant. Consequently, future configurations are likely to require more close-coupled installations with the airframe due to structural and ground clearance requirements. This tendency may lead to an increase in the adverse installation effects which could be mitigated with non-axisymmetric exhausts. However, due to the prohibitive computational cost, limited regions of the design space have been studied. For this reason, a relatively low-cost design approach for the integrated system is required. The aim<sep>To reduce specific fuel consumption, it is expected that the next generation of aero-engines will operate with higher bypass-ratios, and therefore fan diameters, than current in-service architectures. These new propulsion systems will increase the nacelle size and incur in an additional overall weight and drag contribution to the aircraft. In addition, they will be installed more closely-coupled with the airframe, which may lead to an increase in adverse installation effects. As such, it is required to develop compact nacelles which will not counteract the benefits obtained from the new engine cycles. A comprehensive investigation of the effects of nacelle design on the overall aircraft aerodynamic performance is required for a<sep>In crosswind operating conditions, an aero-engine intake can be affected by notable unsteady flow distortions at the fan face. These distortions are typically associated with the ingestion of the ground vortex as well as with flow separation within the intake and can have a detrimental effect on the intake performance and therefore on the operability of the downstream compression system. Measurements of the unsteady velocity field within a model-scale intake under crosswind conditions were conducted using Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (S-PIV) to characterize the velocity field and hence the intake flow distortion across the Aerodynamic Interface Plane (AIP) inside the duct. The intake distortion metrics were calculated for three operating<sep>It is envisaged that future civil aero-engines will operate with greater bypass ratios compared to contemporary configurations to lower specific thrust and improve propulsive efficiency. This trend is likely to be accompanied with the implementation of a shorter nacelle and bypass duct for larger engines. However, a short bypass duct may result in an aerodynamic coupling between the exit flow conditions of the fan Outlet Guide Vanes (OGVs) and the exhaust system. Thus, it is imperative that the design of the exhaust is carried out in combination with the fan exit profile.

This chapter focuses on physical limitations of electricity generation, specifically around the timing and scale of retiring and/or replacing coal-fired power generation capacity to meet the International Energy Agency's (IEAs) two-degree scenario. It explores the aspects of the challenges involved with rapidly transforming global power production. The chapter describes the important elements to the transformation of the global energy supply system using the IEA forecasts as a guide. If the current boom in coal power plant construction continues more rapidly than allowed for in the IEA forecasts, then the overall scale (and rate) of coal-plant decommissioning in future years would necessarily be larger. Understanding achievable rates of energy system transitions is fundamental to developing meaningful energy and climate-change policy.<sep>Decarbonation of the energy system is required at an unprecedented scale to prevent global temperatures rising more than 2°C. A suite of low carbon technologies will be required for this transition. Two of these technologies, wind turbines and electric vehicles, utilise rare earth elements that are sourced from a monopolised supply chain. This could pose a risk to attaining global climate targets. Using demand forecasting, this study shows that 2-degree targets are indeed vulnerable to the rare earth element supply chain. It was found that the consumption of rare earth elements in the electric vehicle industry is unsustainable under current market conditions, while wind turbines are relatively invulnerable to the supply risk of rare earth elements. The stark contrast in risk exposure of these technologies is clearly at odds with the economically optimal deployment projections given in the IEA 2DS scenario. Failure to incorporate these risks in future models will likely impair climate change mitigation efforts.<sep>Electric vehicles are poised to play a large role in the decarbonisation of the transportation sector. World governments have pledged to bring 13 million plug-in electric vehicles on the road by 2020 and 100 million by 2030. The rapid expansion required to meet these targets, from a global stock of 5 million electric vehicles in 2018, has the potential to be constrained by material supply chains. This study has identified 7 key elements which are significant supply risks to the electric vehicle industry: battery grade natural graphite, lithium and cobalt for electric vehicle batteries, and the rare earth elements dysprosium, terbium, praseodymium and neodymium for electric vehicle motors. None of these elements are able to be substituted without (i) increasing the supply risk of the other constrained elements, or (ii) altering industry wide manufacturing processes. The inability to fully mitigate material supply risks at the required market expansion rates is a key issue for minimising carbon emissions from the transportation sector.<sep>The formulation and use of scenarios is now a fundamental part of national and global efforts to assess and plan for climate change. While scenario development initially focused on the technical dimensions of energy, emissions and climate response, in recent years parallel sets of shared socio-economic pathways have been developed to portray the values, motivations, and sociopolitical and institutional dimensions of these systems. However, integrating the technical and social aspects of evolving energy systems is difficult, with transitions dependent on highly uncertain technological advances, social preferences, political governance, climate urgency, and the interaction of these elements to maintain or overcome systemic inertia. A broad range of interdisciplinary knowledge is needed to structure and evaluate these processes, many of which involve a mix of qualitative and quantitative factors. To structure and facilitate the necessary linkages this paper presents an approach for generating a plausible range of scenarios for an emerging energy technology. The method considers influences among technical and social factors that can encourage or impede necessary improvements in the performance and cost of the technology, as well the processes affecting public acceptance and the establishment of governance structures necessary to support effective planning and implementation. A Bayesian network is used to capture relationships among the technological and socioeconomic factors likely to affect the probability that the technology will achieve significant penetration and adoption. The method is demonstrated for carbon capture and storage (CCS): a potential technology on the pathway to deep decarbonization. A preliminary set of expert elicitations is conducted to illustrate how relationships between these factors can be estimated. This establishes a prior or baseline network that can be subsequently analyzed by choosing either optimistic or pessimistic assumptions for respective groups of technical and social variables, identifying sets of key factors that limit or encourage successful deployment.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Audit<sep>Total harmonic distortion<sep>Grid<sep>Exploratory research<sep>Transmitter<sep>Matching (statistics)<sep>Maximum power transfer theorem<sep>Genetic algorithm<sep>Fault (geology)<sep>Capacitive sensing<sep>Battery (electricity)<sep>HVAC<sep>Cost of electricity by source<sep>Voltage<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Distribution (mathematics)<sep>Usability<sep>Scheduling (production processes)<sep>Electric vehicle<sep>Current (fluid)<sep>Energy management<sep>Ant colony optimization algorithms<sep>Photovoltaic system<sep>Wireless power transfer<sep>Sorting<sep>Network topology<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Installation<sep>Net present value<sep>Efficient energy use<sep>Compensation (psychology)</keyword><title>A Comprehensive Overview on the Development of Compensation Topologies for Capacitive Power Transfer System<sep>Multi-objective Optimization of a Capacitive Power Transfer System for Electric Vehicle Charging<sep>An automated transmitter positioning system for misalignment compensation of capacitive-coupled electric vehicles<sep>Locating Faults with Ease- A Fault Current Matching Method for Distribution Feeders<sep>Energy management practices, barriers, and drivers in Bangladesh: An exploratory insight from pulp and paper industry<sep>Assessment of Grid-connected Residential PV-Battery Systems in Sweden - A Techno-economic Perspective<sep>Bi-level planning and scheduling of electric vehicle charging stations for peak shaving and congestion management in low voltage distribution networks</title><abstract>Wireless power transfer (WPT) is becoming an attractive concept as an effective and convenient method of delivering power without direct metal-to-metal contact. Among WPT technologies; capacitive power transfer (CPT) system encounters less power losses compared to inductive power transfer (IPT) system around metal objects. This advantage makes CPT technology a prospective alternative to other prevailing technologies for high power and high efficiency wireless power transfer. To achieve considerable transfer distance, increased efficiency and high-power transfer level; proper designing of the compensation circuit is of utmost importance. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the body of research on different compensation circuit topologies including the advantages as well as disadvantages of each compensation topology are presented in order to summarize the current advancements in this field.<sep>In this paper, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed for the optimization of a capacitive power transfer (CPT) system for electric vehicle (EV) charging, employing non-dominated sorting technique along with a hybrid algorithm integrating ant colony algorithm (extended to continuous domain) and genetic algorithm (ACO <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</inf> -GA). The operating frequency, input voltage, and load resistance are taken as decision variables whereas efficiency and total harmonic distortion (THD) are considered as the objective functions for this study. Optimal solution sets have been chosen from the Pareto-front considering all practical constraints and a simulation model is constructed in Matlab/Simulink based on the optimization results. An efficiency of 77.17% is achieved with a THD of only 0.91% in the simulation which coincides with the optimization result, thus verifying the proposed algorithm.<sep>&lt;span&gt;Misalignments are one of the most unfavorable aspects of the capacitive power transfer (CPT) system, which is inevitable in most of the applications. Misalignments affect the overall resonances in the circuit and decrease the power transfer capability and efficiency. In this paper, an automated electro-mechanical transmitter positioning system is proposed for capacitive wireless charging to withstand both axial and rotational misalignments. The system can align the transmitter based on an adaptive algorithm, with respect to the position of the receiver to mitigate the misalignments. The overall system is designed using SolidWorks and the algorithm is verified using Processing. Then, a hardware prototype is constructed in the laboratory. The accuracy of the proposed system is calculated and compared with the simulation results. The system can achieve an accuracy of 99.5%, in case of axial misalignment and an average accuracy of 98.6%, in case of both axial and rotational misalignments, which validate the simulation results.&lt;/span&gt;<sep>Locating faults in large distribution networks presents a major challenge due to limited measurement data. Deploying smart sensors in the network could improve network observability, but they pose significant techno-economic challenges. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes a cost-effective fault current-matching technique that estimates fault location using network data and fault resistance. First, the method finds the possible fault line sections between adjacent protective devices and calculates the theoretical fault current for each line. Then, the calculated fault currents are compared with measured values using a fault expectancy index, resulting in a compilation of prospective fault locations with corresponding possibilities. To validate the proposed method, two recent fault events in two different feeders recorded from actual distribution grids in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, are used. The method classifies the fault accurately and detects faulted line sections with more than 90 percent fault expectancy based on the test cases. The proposed approach offers an efficient solution to techno-economic challenges, potentially enhancing fault detection and service restoration efforts.<sep>Industrial energy management is critical to ensuring efficient energy usage, market viability, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. In this study, the aim is to investigate energy management practices in paper and pulp industries (PPI) of Bangladesh. The study identifies several barriers to adopt energy management practices; “Lack of governmental attention”, “Inadequate staff awareness” and “limited access to capital” are identified as the major constraints. In addition, HVAC systems and compressed air systems present higher barriers compared to electrical motor and pump systems while looking at the barriers by technology areas. On the other hand, “Owner's demand”, “Commitment from the top management” and “Pressure from the customers and different non-Governmental organization” are found to be the dominant drivers of energy management in the studied PPI. Energy management practices can enhance the energy efficiency approximately by 4–5 % according to the study. Furthermore, this study reveals that the majority of PPIs are unaware of the energy service companies (ESCO) with the lack of a standardized system for energy audit, as well as a lack of trust and information, appearing to be the obstacles behind this.<sep>Ensuring a secure supply of electricity without harming climate is a key challenge for future power system and many renewables-based cutting-edge technologies are introduced to overcome this challenge. This paper aims to study the grid-connected residential PV-battery system at behind-the-meter scenarios in Sweden from a technical and economic perspective. The system is designed with PV arrays, inverters, Lithium-ion or lead-acid batteries. The optimal PV, lithium-ion and lead-acid battery size are determined at two locations (Arlanda and Karlstad) in Sweden based on the highest value of Net Present Value (NPV), Profitability Index (PI), the lowest value of Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and payback period considering system losses, electricity market price, cost and PV incentives and a comparison is performed between these two locations against some techno-economic performance metrics for two combinations of PV-battery systems. Then, the best-case energy profile, bill savings, battery performance are also investigated. Finally, the system is simulated using System Advisory Model (SAM), a renewable analysis software from NREL, USA, and is found that the grid-connected PV with lithium-ion battery system is feasible and more economical considering available PV incentives in Sweden.<sep>Most existing algorithms for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) planning and scheduling of electric vehicles (EVs) do not consider the uncertain behavior of EVs and distribution networks, including the EV arrival and departure times, user driving needs, and realistic residential load and generation profiles. This paper proposes a bi-level planning and operation framework that determines the optimal locations of EVCS and scheduling of EVs to reduce peak load and network congestion in low voltage distribution networks by considering uncertain EV and distribution network behavior. Planning of EVCS is performed to minimize voltage deviations and distribution network losses. The priority-based scheduling algorithm uses the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) technology to charge the EVs during high priority periods to meet the user requirements and discharge during low or medium priority periods to reduce the peak load and thermal overloading in distribution feeders. Based on an Australian scenario, the proposed method has been tested on the IEEE low voltage test feeder. Uncoordinated scheduling of EVs is also implemented and compared with the proposed strategy. The results show that installing EVCS at the optimal locations can reduce the network losses and voltage deviations by 39.38 per cent and 15.32 per cent, respectively. It is also shown that the proposed scheduling of EVs can reduce the peak load of distribution substations and lower the network congestion without affecting the EV charging requirements. With a 55 percent penetration of EVs, the peak load and thermal overload in distribution lines are reduced by 20.53 per cent and 5.88 per cent, respectively.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/119839/lecturer-senior-lecturer-in-accounting/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5073894044", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5038630479", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong focus on energy systems, corporate governance, and sociotechnical systems, aligning well with the job's emphasis on accounting information systems and business processes.

To achieve this goal, chemists traditionally choose the correct starting materials and reaction conditions, but it often lacks selectivity and efficiency. A promising alternative is to design laser control schemes and apply them to guide and control chemical reactions. This mini-review attempts to provide theoretical insight into the laser-induced control of chemical reactions by highlighting some recent achievements, discussing the present challenges, and shedding some light on future prospects.<sep>The creation and dynamical fate of a coherent superposition of electronic states generated in a polyatomic molecule by broadband ionization with extreme ultraviolet pulses is studied using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method together with an ionization continuum model Hamiltonian. The electronic coherence between the hole states usually lasts until the nuclear dynamics leads to decoherence. A key goal of attosecond science is to control the electronic motion and design laser control schemes to retain this coherence for longer timescales. Here, we investigate this possibility using time-delayed pulses and show how this opens up the prospect of coherent control of charge migration phenomenon.<sep>Photochemistry induced by phase-coherent laser light is an intriguing topic. The possibility of weak-field (one-photon) phase-only control of photoisomerization is controversial. Experimental studies on the weak-field coherent control of cis–trans isomerization have led to conflicting results. Here we address this issue by quantum dynamical calculations, focusing on a mechanism where different “phase-shaped” wave packets are quickly stabilized (“dumped”) in the trans configuration because of prompt energy dissipation. We systematically investigate different relaxation rates with the system–bath dynamics described within the time-dependent Hartree approximation leading to a friction-type force. We find evidence for phase control of trans-isomer yields (about 5%) in this model with pure energy dissipation given sufficiently strong dampening.<sep>A theoretical study on the ionization dynamics of carbon atom irradiated with a few-cycle, intense laser field is performed within a quasiclassical model to get mechanistic insights into an earlier reported carrier-envelope phase dependency of ionization probabilities of an atom [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 2013, 110, 083602]. The carrier-envelope phase of the laser pulse is found to govern the overall dynamics, reflecting its importance in controlling electronic motion. To understand the origin of this effect, individual trajectories were analyzed at a particular laser intensity. We found that a variation in the carrier-envelope phase affects the angle of ejection of the electrons and subsequently the attainment of the desired final state.<sep>A theoretical study on the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics of HD+ molecular ions under ultrashort, intense laser pulses is performed by employing a well-established quasi-classical model. The influence of the laser carrier-envelope phase on various channel (H + D+, D + H+, and H+ + D+) probabilities is investigated at different laser field intensities. The carrier-envelope phase is found to govern the dissociation (H + D+ and D + H+) and Coulomb explosion (H+ + D+) channel probabilities. The kinetic energy release distributions of the fragments are also found to be sensitive to the carrier-envelope phase of the laser pulse. Our results are in agreement with the previously reported quantum dynamics studies and experiments.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Solvation<sep>Diabatic<sep>Asymmetry<sep>Atomic orbital<sep>Oscillator strength<sep>Absorption spectroscopy<sep>Photoionization<sep>Quantum decoherence<sep>Isomerization<sep>Relaxation (psychology)<sep>Wave function<sep>Photoemission spectroscopy<sep>Spectral line<sep>Truncation (statistics)<sep>Time-dependent density functional theory<sep>Surface hopping<sep>Potential energy surface<sep>Molecular orbital<sep>Quantum<sep>Excitation<sep>Acetylacetone<sep>Internal conversion<sep>Conical intersection<sep>Pyrazine<sep>Photoexcitation<sep>Computation<sep>Function (biology)<sep>Range (aeronautics)<sep>Pericyclic reaction<sep>DNA<sep>Excited state<sep>Valence (chemistry)<sep>Conical surface<sep>Fortran<sep>Electron<sep>Factorization<sep>Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)<sep>Gaussian<sep>Adiabatic process<sep>Spectroscopy<sep>Hamiltonian (control theory)<sep>Quantum dynamics<sep>Rydberg formula<sep>Maxima and minima<sep>Fluorescence<sep>Aqueous solution<sep>Ring (chemistry)<sep>Fragmentation (computing)</keyword><title>Photoionization of pyrrole from the $$B_2$$ state: a computational study on the effects of Rydberg–valence mixing<sep>Mixed-quantum-classical or fully-quantized dynamics?

Here, benchmark calculations of photoionization cross sections, asymmetry parameters and molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs) have been performed with the aim of discerning between the two types of transitions. In particular, we show that MFPADs are very sensitive probes of the electronic wave function and that accurate experimental MFPADs could be used to identify the electronic character of the $$B_2$$ state.<sep>Three methods for non-adiabatic dynamics are compared to highlight their capabilities. Multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree is a full grid-based solution to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, variational multi-configurational Gaussian (vMCG) uses a less flexible but unrestricted Gaussian wavepacket basis, and trajectory surface hopping (TSH) replaces the nuclear wavepacket with a swarm of classical trajectories. Calculations with all methods using a model Hamiltonian were performed. The vMCG and TSH were also then run in a direct dynamics mode, with the potential energy surfaces calculated on-the-fly using quantum chemistry calculations. All dynamics calculations used the Quantics package, with the TSH calculations using a new interface to a surface hopping code. A novel approach to calculate adiabatic populations from grid-based quantum dynamics using a time-dependent discrete variable representation is presented, allowing a proper comparison of methods. This article is part of the theme issue 'Chemistry without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation'.<sep>The photochemically induced ring-opening isomerization reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to 1,3,5-hexatriene is a textbook example of a pericyclic reaction and has been amply investigated with advanced spectroscopic techniques. The main open question has been the identification of the single reactive state which drives the process. The generally accepted description of the isomerization pathway starts with a valence excitation to the lowest lying bright state, followed by a passage through a conical intersection to the lowest lying doubly excited state, and finally a branching between either the return to the ground state of the cyclic molecule or the actual ring-opening reaction leading to the open-chain isomer. Here, in a joint experimental and computational effort, we demonstrate that the evolution of the excitation-deexcitation process is much more complex than that usually described. In particular, we show that an initially high-lying electronic state smoothly decreasing in energy along the reaction path plays a key role in the ring-opening reaction.<sep>A computational protocol for simulating time-resolved photoelectron signals of medium-sized molecules is presented. The procedure is based on a trajectory surface-hopping description of the excited-state dynamics and a combined Dyson orbital and multicenter B-spline approach for the computation of cross sections and asymmetry parameters. The accuracy of the procedure has been illustrated for the case of ultrafast internal conversion of gas-phase pyrazine excited to the 1B2u(ππ*) state. The simulated spectra and the asymmetry map are compared to the experimental data, and a very good agreement was obtained without applying any energy-dependent rescaling or broadening. An interesting side result of this work is the finding that the signature of the 1Au(nπ*) state is indistinguishable from that of the 1B3u(nπ*) state in the time-resolved photoelectron spectrum. By locating four symmetrically equivalent minima on the lowest-excited (S1) adiabatic potential energy surface of pyrazine, we revealed the strong vibronic coupling of the 1Au(nπ*) and 1B3u(nπ*) states near the S1 ← S0 band origin.<sep>Two algorithms for calculating overlaps between CIS (or TDDFT) type excited state wave functions are presented, one based on an expansion of overlap determinants into level 2 minors (OL2M) and the other based on an expansion of the wave functions into natural transition orbitals (ONTO). Both algorithms are significantly faster than previously available algorithms, with the ONTO algorithm reducing the cost of a single overlap element calculation by a factor of the square of the number of occupied orbitals in the system. The algorithm exhibits orders of magnitude faster calculations for large systems and significantly increases the size of systems for which TDDFT based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations can be performed. The OL2M algorithm is substantially slower for a single overlap matrix element but becomes preferred when overlaps between large numbers of states are required. Additionally, we test the accuracy of approximate overlaps calculated using truncated wave functions and show that truncation can lead to large errors in the overlaps. Lastly, we provide examples of applications for wave function overlaps outside the context of nonadiabatic dynamics.<sep>Amyloids have unique structural, chemical, and optical properties. Although much theoretical effort has been directed toward understanding amyloid nucleation, the understanding of their optical properties has remained rather limited. In particular, the photophysical mechanisms leading to near-UV excitation and characteristic blue-green luminescence in amyloid systems devoid of aromatic amino acids have not been resolved. We use ab initio static calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations to study the excited electronic states of model amyloid-like peptides. We show that their photophysics is essentially governed by the multitude of nπ* states with excitation localized on the amide groups. The strong stabilization of the nπ* states with respect to the amide group deplanarization and the concomitant increase of the oscillator strength make excitation in the near-UV possible. With respect to emission, our dynamics simulations revealed that the amyloid cross β arrangement effectively hinders the nonradiative relaxation channels usually operative in proteins. Finally, we show that after relaxation of the photoexcited peptides toward the minimum of the different nπ* states, fluorescence takes place in the visible (green) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<sep>Electronic quantum coherence is a prerequisite for charge migration in molecules and emerging molecular quantum technologies. It also underlies new forms of spectroscopy and can enhance molecular function. Whether conical intersections can create electronic coherence and for how long electronic coherence can survive in aqueous environments has remained elusive and controversial, respectively. Here, we use X-ray spectroscopy to realize a breakthrough on both of these topics. We find that electronic relaxation from the $^1$B$_{2\\rm{u}}$($\\pi\\pi^*$) state of pyrazine through conical intersections (CIs) induces previously unobserved electronic and vibrational quantum coherences between the $^1$B$_{3\\rm{u}}$(n$\\pi^*$) and $^1$A$_{\\rm{u}}$(n$\\pi^*$) states in the gas phase, which correspond to an electronic ring current. These coherences are entirely suppressed when pyrazine is dissolved in water. These observations, supported by the latest advances in multiconfigurational electronic-structure calculations and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, confirm that CIs can create electronic coherences and that aqueous solvation can decohere them in less than 40 fs. This study opens the door to the investigation of the broad class of electronic coherences created during light-induced molecular dynamics and to quantify their susceptibility to aqueous solvation.<sep>The theoretical assignment of electronic spectra of polyatomic molecules is a challenging problem that requires the specification of the character of a large number of electronic states. We propose a procedure for automatically determining the character of electronic transitions and apply it to the study of UV spectra of DNA bases in the gas phase and in the aqueous environment. The procedure is based on the computation of electronic wave function overlaps and accounts for an extensive sampling of nuclear geometries. Novelties of this work are the theoretical assignment of the electronic spectra of DNA bases up to 190 nm and a state specific analysis of solvation effects. By accounting for different effects contributing to the total solvent shift we obtained a good agreement between the computed and experimental spectra. Effects of vibrational averaging, temperature and solvent-induced structural changes shift excitation energies to lower values. Solvent-solute electrostatic interactions are state specific and strongly destabilize nRyd states, and to lesser extent nπ* and πRyd states. Altogether, this results in the stabilization of ππ* states and destabilization of nπ*, πRyd and nRyd states in solution.<sep>Photoelectron angular distribution (PAD) in the laboratory frame for randomly oriented molecules is typically described by a single anisotropy parameter, the so-called asymmetry parameter. However, especially from a theoretical perspective, it is more natural to consider molecular photoionization by using a molecular frame. The molecular frame PADs (MFPADs) may be used to extract information about the electronic structure of the system studied. In the last decade, significant experimental efforts have been directed to MFPAD measurements. MFPADs are highly characterizing signatures of the final ionic states. In particular, they are very sensitive to the nature of the final state, which is embodied in the corresponding Dyson orbital. In our previous work on acetylacetone, a prototype system for studying intra-molecular hydrogen bond interactions, we followed the dynamics of the excited states involved in the photoexcitation-deexcitation process of this molecule. It remains to be explored the possibility of discriminating between different excited states through the MFPAD profiles. The calculation of MFPADs to differentiate excited states can pave the way to the possibility of a clear discrimination for all the cases where the recognition of excited states is otherwise intricate.<sep>C4F7N is a promising candidate for the replacement of sulfur hexafluoride as an insulating medium, and it is important to understand the chemical changes initiated in the molecule by collision with free electrons, specifically the formation of neutral fragments. The first step of neutral fragmentation is electronic excitation, yet neither the absorption spectrum in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region nor the electron energy loss spectrum have previously been reported. Here, we experimentally probed the excited states by VUV photoabsorption spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). We found that the distribution of states populated upon electron impact with low-energy electrons is significantly different from that following photoabsorption. This difference was confirmed and interpreted with ab initio modeling of both VUV and EELS spectra. We propose here a new computational protocol for the simulation of EELS spectra combining the Born approximation with approximate forms of correlated wave functions, which allows us to calculate the (usually very expensive) scattering cross sections at a cost similar to the calculation of oscillator strengths. Finally, we perform semi-classical non-adiabatic dynamics simulations to investigate the possible neutral fragments of the molecule formed through electron-induced neutral dissociation. We show that the product distribution is highly non-statistical.<sep>Trajectory surface hopping (TSH) methods have been widely used to study photoinduced nonadiabatic processes. In the present study, nonadiabatic dynamics simulations with the widely used Tully's fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm and a Landau-Zener-type TSH (LZSH) algorithm have been performed for the internal conversion dynamics of pyrazine. The accuracy of the two TSH algorithms has been critically evaluated by a direct comparison with exact quantum dynamics calculations for a model of pyrazine. The model comprises the three lowest excited electronic states (B3u(nπ*), A1u(nπ*), and B2u(ππ*)) and the nine most relevant vibrational degrees of freedom. Considering photoexcitation to the diabatic B2u(ππ*) state, we examined the time-dependent diabatic and adiabatic electronic population dynamics. It is found that the diabatic populations obtained with both TSH methods are in good agreement with the exact quantum results. Fast population oscillations between the B3u(nπ*) and A1u(nπ*) states, which reflect nonadiabatic electronic transitions driven by coherent dynamics in the normal mode Q8a, are qualitatively reproduced by both TSH methods. In addition to the model study, the TSH methods have been interfaced with the second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction ab initio electronic-structure method to perform full-dimensional on-the-fly nonadiabatic dynamics simulations for pyrazine. It is found that the electronic population dynamics obtained with the LZSH method is in excellent agreement with that obtained by the FSSH method using a local diabatization algorithm. Moreover, the electronic populations of the full-dimensional on-the-fly calculations are in excellent agreement with the populations of the three-state nine-mode model, which confirms that the internal conversion dynamics of pyrazine is accurately represented by this reduced-dimensional model on the time scale under consideration (200 fs). The original FSSH method, in which the electronic wave function is propagated in the adiabatic representation, yields less accurate results. The oscillations in the populations of the diabatic B3u(nπ*) and A1u(nπ*) states driven by the mode Q8a are also observed in the full-dimensional dynamics simulations.<sep>The calculation of overlaps between many-electron wave functions at different nuclear geometries during nonadiabatic dynamics simulations requires the evaluation of a large number of determinants of matrices that differ only in a few rows/columns. While this calculation is fast for small systems, its cost grows faster than the alternative electronic structure calculation used to obtain the wave functions. For wave functions that can be written as a CIS expansion, all determinants can be computed using the set of level-2 minors of the reference matrix. However, this is still a costly computation for large systems. In this paper, we provide an algorithm for efficiently calculating all level-2 minors of a matrix by re-utilizing and updating the LU factorization for the determinants of the minors. This approach results in a parallel version of the algorithm that is up to an order of magnitude faster then the current best parallel implementation. The algorithm thus allows the computation of exact wave function overlaps for relatively large systems, with a high density of states, at virtually no cost compared with the electronic structure calculations. Furthermore, the new algorithm opens the path to further investigations in efficient computing of the exact wave function overlaps for complex wave functions such as MR-CIS and MR-CISD. Program Title: CIS Overlap Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: FORTRAN 2008, C Nature of problem: Calculation of overlaps between CIS type wave functions at different nuclear geometries during nonadiabatic dynamics simulation requires calculating a large number of connected determinants and scales with the seventh power of the size of the system being studied. Without additional approximations, for large systems this computation becomes more costly than the electronic structure calculation used to obtain the wave functions. Solution method: All of the determinants required for a CIS wave function overlap calculation can be derived from the set of all level-2 minors of the matrix of overlaps between the reference Slater determinants. We developed an algorithm for efficiently computing all level-2 minors of a matrix. This part of the computational process was the bottleneck in previous solutions to the problem and is now an order of magnitude faster resulting in significantly faster overall calculation of the wave function overlaps.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/70014/postdoctoral-research-fellow-in-chemistry-/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5055776196", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5071759433", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in photophysical characterisation and laser control of chemical reactions, which aligns well with the job's focus on spectroscopy and organic materials.

However, due to data deficiencies, this shortage thesis has been challenged. This paper develops a new methodological approach to estimating the supply and demand for officers. It analyses and triangulates different sets of data released by national maritime authorities. The analysis shows that in fact there is an oversupply of officers. Nevertheless, the supply of chief officers and second engineers may be tight. This insight can help maritime authorities and the industry make informed decisions regarding maritime human resource development. Furthermore, the new approach provides a useful tool for national maritime authorities to work out and monitor the supply and demand balance of their seafarer officers.<sep>This paper examines technology introduction on ships guided by three questions: (1) what drives technology introduction; (2) how seafarers are involved in the process; (3) what the consequences are in shipping. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews with ship managers and senior seafarer officers as well as a questionnaire study with seafarer officers. They reveal a discrepancy between the regulatory intention of technology introduction and the actual implementation process on ships. While the former is spurred by safety concerns, the latter is driven by economic rationality. This discrepancy makes technology a double edged sword in shipping. On the one hand, it plays an important role in improving safety, and on the other, it brings about work intensification and increased surveillance at workplace.<sep>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the ways in which workers employ rule breaking, rule bending and deviations from management defined norms in the workplace and the impact this has on their occupational health and safety (OHS) experiences. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted with 37 seafarers working on board four vessels engaged in international trade. The data were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed using NVivo software. Findings The findings indicate that seafarers utilised workplace fiddles – which included rule breaking, rule bending and deviating from management defined norms – in order to engender a workable system in which they could remain safe but also profitable to those who controlled their labour. Moreover, the findings suggest that shore-side management deflected the responsibility for rule violations by deferring many of the decisions regarding features of life on board – such as the scheduling of work hours – to the senior officers on board. Originality/value The paper sheds light on where, in practice, responsibility for OHS lies in the international shipping industry, an industry in which workers experience relatively high rates of work-related fatalities, injuries and mental health conditions.<sep>Container terminals are purpose built or substantially adapted ports virtually exclusively involved with the transport of containerised goods. They now exist everywhere and have redesigned dock-work to increase productivity and efficiencies in the handling of goods, making physical handling by dock-workers increasingly redundant. Conventional wisdom suggests that arrangements for the safety and health of those who remain in employment are generally improved in comparison with past conditions. Yet, reliable evidence of the effects of work on the occupational safety and health (OSH) of these workers is scarce. This paper is based on research which examined the OSH experiences of workers involved with operational tasks in terminals operated by global network terminal (GNT) companies in four countries situated in Asia-Pacific and Europe. It explored these experiences along with the respondents’ perceptions concerning the effectiveness of arrangements made to manage their OSH risks, and compared findings between countries. The research demonstrated a significant gap between managers’ understandings of the operation of arrangements for OSH and the perceptions and experiences of workers, both in relation to OSH outcomes and the effectiveness of the OSH arrangements. This was especially evident for work-related ill-health, workers’ representation and consultation on OSH, and in the differences in the experience of all these between directly employed workers and those employed by contractors. The paper discusses the implications for improved OSH arrangements and outcomes.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Fault detection and isolation<sep>Turbine<sep>Junction temperature<sep>Salient<sep>Electromagnetic coil<sep>Failure rate<sep>Wake<sep>Fault (geology)<sep>Electric machine<sep>Scalability<sep>Emulation<sep>Electronic circuit<sep>Wound rotor motor<sep>Voltage source<sep>Scale (ratio)<sep>Torque<sep>Insulated-gate bipolar transistor<sep>Energy (signal processing)<sep>Induction generator<sep>Digital signal processing<sep>Cost of electricity by source<sep>Wind power<sep>Harmonics<sep>Convolutional neural network<sep>Voltage<sep>Converters<sep>Data processing<sep>Timeline<sep>Rotor (electric)<sep>Power optimizer<sep>Maintenance actions<sep>Pulse-width modulation<sep>Transient (computer programming)<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Structural health monitoring<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Reliability (semiconductor)<sep>Wireless sensor network<sep>Interpretability<sep>Downtime<sep>Transient response<sep>Electrical network<sep>Rotation (mathematics)<sep>Vibration<sep>Skew<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Wind speed<sep>Ringing<sep>Metre<sep>Stall torque<sep>Signal processing<sep>Instrumentation (computer programming)<sep>SIGNAL (programming language)<sep>Offshore wind power</keyword><title>Appendix C.

Modern techniques and methods have been shown and the next chapters show how the signals from these have been applied to provide CM information. The following chapters will therefore describe the major temperature, chemical, mechanical and electrical techniques available for monitoring.<sep>Studies demonstrate that the power converter has one of the highest failure rates in a wind turbine, with a key failure driver being the power module junction temperature (Tj). This paper details an experimental setup for simplified emulation of wind turbine conditions on a power converter with infra-red sensing of IGBT Tj. Results are compared to previous simulation work for a PMSG wind turbine, with the same trend of increasing mean Tj with wind speed found, and the need to use an equivalent generator reactance in highlighted. A commercial-scale prototype for more accurate wind turbine converter emulation is also detailed.<sep>This chapter could be subtitled &apos;the way rotating electrical machines fail in service&apos;. These machines convert electrical to mechanical energy, or vice versa, and achieve this by magnetically coupling electrical circuits across an air-gap that permits rotational freedom of one of these circuits. Mechanical energy is transmitted into, or out of, the machine via a drive train that is mechanically connected to one of the electric circuits. The purpose of this chapter is to explain their constructional principles and the main causes of failure. The chapter is illustrated with a number of photographs to demonstrate to the reader the salient features of electrical machines.<sep>In-service turbine monitoring is essential for maximizing the wind energy contribution to the global energy budget. Measurement of turbine shaft torque under transient wind conditions is fundamental to develop reliable condition monitoring techniques. Contact based measurements bring their own disadvantages and non-contactless measurements have many potential advantages. However, their performance needs to be validated against standard methods. This paper focuses on the development of an enhanced transient Feature Selective Validation (FSV) techniques to undertake this analysis with an emphasis on transient data processing. The nature of FSV makes it a natural technique to consider for this problem space. Open questions have existed as to how transients should be dealt with in FSV. This paper overcomes the limitations of previous approaches for step-function transient comparison and presents analytical methods to ensure the transient feature itself is considered, irrespective of how much pre- and post- transient data happens to be included.<sep>Abstract The reliability of wind turbine power converters is crucial for analyzing wind energy project costs, and for estimating maintenance and downtime. The published literature in this field relies on evaluating the reliability effect of wind speed to estimate the converter lifetime. However, this paper demonstrates that wind turbulence intensity, which has not been widely considered in similar reliability analyses, shows a significant impact on converter lifetime. This paper uses 821 10‐min wind speed time series sampled at 1 Hz on the two most commonly deployed wind turbine converter topologies: the two‐level voltage source and the three‐level neutral point clamped. Electromechanical and thermal modelling, combined with statistical analysis shows that mean wind speed and turbulence intensity both impact the lifetime of both converter topologies. However, the paper estimates that the three‐level converter can operate 2.4 to 4.0 times longer than the two‐level converter depending on the operating wind speed and turbulence intensity.<sep>The wind industry is showing increasing awareness about the importance of long-term direct shaft mechanical torque measurements to fully understand wind turbine (WT) dynamics, adopt proactive solutions for extreme load mitigation and enhance condition monitoring (CM) capabilities. Although torsional effects are important, torque measurement on such large, inaccessible machines is practically and logistically difficult, mainly because of the costly and intrusive specialised equipment currently available. This study details an experimental set-up for the investigation of shaft dynamic transient load and speed measurements through a contactless, low-cost torque meter. Results are obtained over a range of applied loads and compared with reference measurements from an in-line, invasive torque transducer. Average torque and speed root-mean-square error values of 0.53 Nm and 0.35 rpm, respectively, indicate good accuracy of the proposed contactless torque meter. Its implementation in the field would allow direct, cheap, real-time measurements of WT drive train loads for performance monitoring, control and CM purposes.<sep>Abstract Effective and timely health monitoring of wind turbine gearboxes and generators is essential to reduce the costs of operations and maintenance activities, especially offshore. This paper presents a scalable and lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) framework using high‐dimensional raw condition monitoring data for the automatic detection of multiple wind turbine electromechanical faults. The proposed approach leverages the potential of combining information from a variety of signals to learn features and to discriminate the types of fault and their severity. As a result of the CNN layers used to extract features from the signals, this architecture works in the time domain and can digest high‐resolution multi‐sensor data streams in real‐time. To overcome the inherent black‐box nature of AI models, this research proposes two interpretability techniques, multidimensional scaling and layer‐wise relevance propagation, to analyse the proposed model's inner‐working and identify the signal features relevant for fault classification. Experimental results show high performance and classification accuracies above 99.9% for all fault cases tested, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed fault‐detection system.<sep>Abstract Maintenance is essential in keeping wind energy assets operating efficiently. With the development of advanced condition monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics, condition‐based maintenance has attracted much attention in the offshore wind industry in recent years. This paper models various maintenance activities and their impacts on the degradation and performance of offshore wind turbine components. An integrated maintenance strategy of corrective maintenance, imperfect time‐based preventive maintenance and condition‐based maintenance is proposed and compared with other traditional maintenance strategies. A maintenance simulation programme is developed to simulate the degradation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines and estimate their performance. A case study on a 10‐MW offshore wind turbine (OWT) is presented to analyse the performance of different maintenance strategies. The simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy not only reduces the total maintenance cost but also improves the energy generation by reducing the total downtime and expected energy not supplied. Furthermore, the proposed maintenance strategy is optimised to find the best degradation threshold and balance the trade‐off between the use of condition‐based maintenance and other maintenance activities.<sep>Converter reliability has a high impact on wind turbine reliability and therefore cost of wind energy. The wind turbine industry is adopting two control strategies for power converters, Direct Torque Control (DTC) and Field Oriented Control (FOC). Both control methods show high performance in megawatt-scale, variable speed wind turbines. They have similarities and differences in their way of operating and controlling the power converter. This paper investigates whether or not differences between DTC and FOC are impacting wind turbine power converter reliability. It assesses and compares converter reliability between two identical wind turbine systems, one with DTC and the other with FOC. The comparison is based on simulating a range of constant wind speeds on two wind turbine models and analysing the converter lifetime of each based on the semiconductors&apos; thermal cycling. The results show how the operation of each control strategy affects converter reliability with the interaction of varying wind speeds. The modelled wind turbine converter IGBT lifetime drops by 26% and diode lifetime drops by 15%when the converter is controlled with DTC rather than FOC at the rated wind speed.<sep>Electrical machines in VSDs have been reported to be less reliable than those fed direct -on-line from the grid mains, see Montanan. This is because the voltage supply imposes extra stresses when synthesised by a power electronic converter. Our focus here is on drive systems using voltage source converters (VSC) where the DC link is capacitively smoothed. Two-level pulse-width-modulation (PWM) is usually used in low-voltage drives for machine voltages up to 690 V,line-line. Multi-level converters may be used in MV drives for motors up to 11 kV, see Stone et al. (2014). In addition to voltage source converters, there are also current source converters with an inductively smoothed DC link for large motors rated at tens of MW. Harmonics and inter-harmonics in the inverter output and machine windings also increase machine stresses through electrical, thermal and mechanical effects. we will outline some major and common issues of electrical machines in VSDs or generator systems and describe the available techniques for monitoring the major fault mechanisms which are new to VSDs. The working principles of these techniques will be analysed to understand their capabilities and limitations.<sep>This paper outlines a methodology for assessing the reliability and cost of operating multi-terminal High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission interconnectors with a comparison being drawn on the benefits of using modular multilevel converters (MMC). The MMCs random failure/repair processes are modelled as either a two-state or three-state Markov processes. A time-sequential Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate the operation of the modified IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) with the MMC-HVDC interconnectors, over a one-year period. The RTS accommodates variable wind generation, and the results confirm the use of HVDC as tie lines provide geographical aggregation, allowing for much greater penetration of variable generation in the connected systems. The three-state MMC model, in addition to the binary up and down states, consists of a derated state in which the converter voltage is reduced to 57.7% of its nominal voltage. The additional state was found to reduce the downtime of the link by 89.6%, increasing the available flow capacity by 458 GWh/year. The increase flow capacity leads to an increase in arbitrage revenue of €3.17m per year and a reduction in project payback time of 1.5 years.<sep>A star type wireless sensor network based on nine-axis micro-electromechanical inertial motion sensors with the potential to include up to 254 sensor nodes is presented, and an investigation into the mechanical and structural effects of bell ringing on bell towers is presented as a possible application. This low-power and low-cost system facilitates the continual monitoring of mechanical forces exerted by swinging bells on their support and thus helps avoid structural degradation and damage. Each sensor measures bell rotation, and a novel method utilising only the instantaneous rotational angle is implemented to calculate the force caused by bell ringing. In addition, a commonly used, however, previously experimentally unconfirmed assumption that allows great simplification of force calculations was also proven to be valid by correlating predicted theoretical values with measurement data. Forces produced by ringing a 1425 kg bell in Durham Cathedral were characterised and found to agree with literature. The sensor network will form the basis of a toolkit that provides a scalable turnkey method to determine the exact mechanisms that cause excessive vibration in mechanical and architectural structures, and has the potential to find further applications in low-frequency distributed structural health monitoring.<sep>Abstract Levelised cost of energy is an important measure to evaluate the success of a wind energy project. It includes all the capital and operational expenditures of a wind turbine over its lifetime based on the expected power generated. In the literature, wind turbine reliability is largely neglected in levelised cost of energy estimation. This paper presents a model to evaluate levelised cost of energy while considering the reliability and maintenance of wind turbine subassemblies. The key concept behind this model is that the failure rate of a wind turbine subassembly depends on the preventive maintenance spending. The proposed model makes it possible to relate reliability data, such as failure rate and downtime of wind turbine subassemblies, to the operation and maintenance expenditure, as well as the annual energy production. The model is analysed using a sample set of recently published reliability data and it is observed that both the operation and maintenance expenditure and levelised cost of energy are convex functions of the subassembly’s failure rate and the preventive maintenance spending. This study can help wind turbine manufacturers and operators identify the level of reliability improvement and maintenance investment required to minimise the levelised cost of energy.<sep>Abstract Nowadays, the increasing demand of electricity and environmental hazards of the greenhouse gas lead to the requirement of renewable energies. The wind energy has been proved as one of the most successful sustainable energies. Recently, the development trend of the wind energy is to build large offshore wind farms (OWFs) with hundreds of wind turbines, which could generates more power in one wind farm. In the large OWF, the wake effect is a very important impact factor to the wind farms, especially for those with close spacing. Therefore, the wind farm layout, the location of the wind turbines (WTs) is very essential to the performance of the whole wind farm, especially for large OWFs. In this research, we focus on the optimization of the large OWF layout by considering performance of the OWF, such as the total output energy. Firstly, the model for wind farm performance evaluation is established by incorporating historical wind speed data and the wake effect which can affect the total wind farm output. Then, by using the metaheuristic algorithms, the genetic algorithm (GA), the OWF layout is optimized. This study can offer useful information to the wind farm manufactures in the large OWF design phase.<sep>In MW-sized wind turbines, the most widely-used generator is the wound rotor induction machine, with a partially-rated voltage source converter connected to the rotor. This generator is a significant cause of wind turbine fault modes. In this paper, a harmonic time-stepped generator model is applied to derive wound rotor induction generator electrical & mechanical signals for fault measurement, and propose simple closed-form analytical expressions to describe them. Predictions are then validated with tests on a 30 kW induction generator test rig. Results show that generator rotor unbalance produces substantial increases in the side-bands of supply frequency and slotting harmonic frequencies in the spectra of current, power, speed, mechanical torque and vibration measurements. It is believed that this is the first occasion in which such comprehensive approach has been presented for this type of machine, with healthy & faulty conditions at varying loads and rotor faults. Clear recommendations of the relative merits of various electrical & mechanical signals for detecting rotor faults are given, and reliable fault indicators are identified for incorporation into wind turbine condition monitoring systems. Finally, the paper proposes that fault detectability and reliability could be improved by data fusion of some of these electrical & mechanical signals.<sep>Abstract Reliability is critical to the design, operation, maintenance, and performance assessment and improvement of wind turbines (WTs). This paper systematically reviews publicly available reliability data for both onshore and offshore WTs and investigates the impacts of reliability on the cost of energy. WT failure rates and downtimes, broken down by subassembly, are collated from 18 publicly available databases including over 18 000 WTs, corresponding to over 90 000 turbine‐years. The data are classified based on the types of data collected (failure rate and stop rate) and by onshore and offshore populations. A comprehensive analysis is performed to investigate WT subassembly reliability data variations, identify critical subassemblies, compare onshore and offshore WT reliability, and understand possible sources of uncertainty. Large variations in both failure rates and downtimes are observed, and the skew in failure rate distribution implies that large databases with low failure rates, despite their diverse populations, are less uncertain than more targeted surveys, which are easily skewed by WT type failures. A model is presented to evaluate the levelised cost of energy as a function of WT failure rates and downtimes. A numerical study proves a strong and nonlinear relationship between WT reliability and operation and maintenance expenditure as well as annual energy production. Together with the cost analysis model, the findings can help WT operators identify the optimal degree of reliability improvement to minimise the levelised cost of energy.<sep>Abstract This paper presents a simplified automated fault detection scheme for wind turbine induction generators with rotor electrical asymmetries. Fault indicators developed in previous works have made use of the presence of significant spectral peaks in the upper sidebands of the supply frequency harmonics; however, the specific location of these peaks may shift depending on the wind turbine speed. As wind turbines tend to operate under variable speed conditions, it may be difficult to predict where these fault‐related peaks will occur. To accommodate for variable speeds and resulting shifting frequency peak locations, previous works have introduced methods to identify or track the relevant frequencies, which necessitates an additional set of processing algorithms to locate these fault‐related peaks prior to any fault analysis. In this work, a simplified method is proposed to instead bypass the issue of variable speed (and shifting frequency peaks) by introducing a set of bandpass filters that encompass the ranges in which the peaks are expected to occur. These filters are designed to capture the fault‐related spectral information to train a classifier for automatic fault detection, regardless of the specific location of the peaks. Initial experimental results show that this approach is robust against variable speeds and further shows good generalizability in being able to detect faults at speeds and conditions that were not presented during training. After training and tuning the proposed fault detection system, the system was tested on “unseen” data and yielded a high classification accuracy of 97.4%, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.<sep>Abstract The fast‐growing offshore wind energy sector brings opportunities to provide a sustainable energy resource but also challenges in offshore wind turbine (OWT) operation and maintenance management. Existing operational simulation models assume deterministic input reliability and failure cost data, whereas OWT reliability and failure costs vary depending on several factors, and it is often not possible to specify them with certainty. This paper focuses on modelling reliability and failure cost uncertainties and their impacts on OWT operational and economic performance. First, we present a probabilistic method for modelling reliability data uncertainty with a quantitative parameter estimation from available reliability data resources. Then, failure cost uncertainty is modelled using fuzzy logic that relates a component's failure cost to its capital cost and downtime. A time‐sequential Monte Carlo simulation is presented to simulate operational sequences of OWT components. This operation profile is later fed into a fuzzy cost assessment and coupled with a wind power curve model to evaluate OWT availability, energy production, operational expenditures and levelised cost of energy. A case study with different sets of reliability data is presented, and the results show that impacts of uncertainty on OWT performance are magnified in databases with low components' reliability. In addition, both reliability and cost uncertainties can contribute to more than 10% of the cost of energy variation. This research can provide practitioners with methods to handle data uncertainties in reliability and operational simulation of OWTs and help them to quantify the variability and dependence of wind power performance on data uncertainties.<sep>Abstract Wind energy is growing at a fast pace around the world. According to a report published by WindEurope, 55% of total power capacity installations in the EU came from wind in 2017. In this context, offshore wind plays a decisive role, with countries such as the UK leading the development of large-scale offshore wind projects within Europe and around the world. It is essential that the cost of energy from offshore wind remains competitive with other sources of energy to encourage further investment in offshore wind developments. One way to maintain and further reduce the cost of offshore wind energy is to take advantage of economies of scale by increasing the megawatt ratings of offshore wind turbines. On the other hand, the operational expenditure of the turbines could also be reduced significantly. In this paper, we present a new integrated operation simulation framework for performance evaluation of multi-megawatt direct drive wind turbines suitable for use in far offshore wind farms. The operation simulation considers several essential wind turbine data such as component reliability, i.e. failure rates and downtimes per failure, historical wind speed, turbine information, and repair cost per failure to estimate the operational and economic performance of the wind turbine in its entire lifetime. In the proposed operation simulation, component reliability models and a wind power model are coupled together to simulate wind turbine operation over its entire lifetime using a time-sequential Monte Carlo simulation. Since the reliability data for large-scale offshore wind turbines are scarce and/or restricted to only direct stakeholders, a range of operational profiles for the turbines based on different level of reliability are simulated. In addition, the economic performance of the turbine is measured by defining an index for levelised cost of energy as a function of component reliability. In this way, the wind turbine reliability, power output, failure cost and levelised cost of energy are estimated under the variation of input reliability data. The results of this paper can inform wind turbine performance depending on the reliability of its components, and provide useful information for critical components identification and economic assessment of future far offshore wind turbines.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/290180/lecturer-in-natural-area-sustainable-tourism-management/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5056357093", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5031545729", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong focus on maritime industry and occupational safety, which aligns partially with the job's emphasis on sustainable tourism and natural area management, whereas Candidate B's expertise in wind energy and renewable resources is less relevant to the specific requirements of the role in tourism management.\nPreferred: A\nConfidence score: 70", "created": 1737539564, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 66, "prompt_tokens": 6916, "total_tokens": 6982, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 6852}, "comparison": "Candidate A demonstrates a strong focus on maritime industry and occupational safety, which aligns partially with the job's emphasis on sustainable tourism and natural area management, whereas Candidate B's expertise in wind energy and renewable resources is less relevant to the specific requirements of the role in tourism management.", "preferred": "A", "confidence_score": 70, "passage_rank1": 41, "passage_rank2": 78}

Such system must cope with varying load and evolving usage reflecting societies interaction and dependency on automated computing systems whilst satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Enabling these systems are a cohort of conceptual technologies, synthesized to meet demand of evolving computing applications. In order to understand current and future challenges of such system, there is a need to identify key technologies enabling future applications. In this study, we aim to explore how three emerging paradigms (Blockchain, IoT and Artificial Intelligence) will influence future cloud computing systems. Further, we identify several technologies driving these paradigms and invite international experts to discuss the current status and future directions of cloud computing. Finally, we proposed a conceptual model for cloud futurology to explore the influence of emerging paradigms and technologies on evolution of cloud computing.<sep>Born from a need for a pure “pay-per-use” model and highly scalable platform, the “Serverless” paradigm emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications. Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage, for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms, and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering Edge computing.<sep>Auto-scaling of Web applications is an extensively investigated issue in cloud computing. To evaluate auto-scaling mechanisms, the cloud community is facing considerable challenges on either real cloud platforms or custom test-beds. Challenges include – but not limited to – deployment impediments, the complexity of setting parameters, and most importantly, the cost of hosting and testing Web applications on a massive scale. Hence, simulation is presently one of the most popular evaluation solutions to overcome these obstacles. Existing simulators, however, fail to provide support for hosting, deploying and subsequently auto-scaling of Web applications. In this paper, we introduce AutoScaleSim, which extends the existing CloudSim simulator, to support auto-scaling of Web applications in cloud environments in a customizable, extendable and scalable manner. Using AutoScaleSim, the cloud community can freely implement/evaluate policies for all four phases of auto-scaling mechanisms, that is, Monitoring, Analysis, Planning and Execution. AutoScaleSim can also be used for evaluating load balancing algorithms similarly. We conducted a set of experiments to validate and carefully evaluate the performance of AutoScaleSim in a real cloud platform, with a wide range of performance metrics.<sep>Mechanisms for dynamically adding and removing Virtual Machines (VMs) to reduce cost while minimizing the latency are called auto-scaling. Latency improvements are mainly fulfilled through minimizing the \"average\" response times while unpredictabilities and fluctuations of the Web applications, aka flash crowds, can result in very high latencies for users' requests. Requests influenced by flash crowd suffer from long latencies, known as outliers. Such outliers are inevitable to a large extent as auto-scaling solutions continue to improve the average, not the \"tail\" of latencies. In this paper, we study possible sources of tail latency in auto-scaling mechanisms for Web applications. Based on our extensive evaluations in a real cloud platform, we discovered sources of a tail latency as 1) large requests, i.e. those data-intensive; 2) long-term scaling intervals; 3) instant analysis of scaling parameters; 4) conservative, i.e. tight, threshold tuning; 5) load-unaware surplus VM selection policies used for executing a scale-down decision; 6) cooldown feature, although cost-effective; and 7) VM start-up delay. We also discovered that after improving the average latency by auto-scaling mechanisms, the tail may behave differently, demanding dedicated tail-aware solutions for auto-scaling mechanisms.<sep>Summary Nowadays, with the development of communication systems, massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) have become very popular. In these games, the players all over the world dynamically interact with each other by sending play actions such as shootings, movements, or chatting in the form of MMOG sessions in real time through a large‐scale distributed environment. Leveraging affordable cloud computing to host such services is a widely investigated issue. It is because the arrival rate of players to the game environment has to make fluctuations, and the players expect services to be always available with an acceptable quality of service (QoS), especially in terms of the response time. Therefore, the dynamic provisioning of resources in order to deal with fluctuating demands due to variability in the arrival rate of players of the MMOG services is highly recommended. In this paper, we propose a learning‐based resource provisioning approach for MMOG services that is based on the combination of the autonomic computing paradigm and learning automata (LA). The remarkable performance of the proposed approach in terms of response time, cost, and allocated virtual machines (VMs) is assessed through simulation and comparison with the existing approaches.<sep>Serverless edge computing is a specialized system design tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It leverages serverless computing to minimize operational management and enhance resource efficiency, and utilizes the concept of edge computing to allow code execution near the data sources. However, edge devices powered by renewable energy face challenges due to energy input variability, resulting in imbalances in their operational availability. As a result, high-powered nodes may waste excess energy, while lowpowered nodes may frequently experience unavailability, impacting system sustainability. Addressing this issue requires energy-aware resource schedulers, but existing cloud-native serverless frameworks are energy-agnostic. To overcome this, we propose an energyaware scheduler for sustainable serverless edge systems. We introduce a reference architecture for such systems and formally model energy-aware resource scheduling, treating the function-to-node assignment as an imbalanced energy-minimizing assignment problem. We then design an optimal offline algorithm and propose faasHouse, an online energy-aware scheduling algorithm that utilizes resource sharing through computation offloading. Lastly, we evaluate faasHouse against benchmark algorithms using real-world renewable energy traces and a practical cluster of single-board computers managed by Kubernetes. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in balanced operational availability (by 46%) and throughput (by 44%) compared to the Kubernetes scheduler.<sep>In this paper, we present energy-aware scheduling for Serverless edge computing. Energy awareness is critical since edge nodes, in many Internet of Things (IoT) domains, are meant to be powered by renewable energy sources that are variable, making low-powered and/or overloaded (bottleneck) nodes unavailable and not operating their services. This awareness is also required since energy challenges have not been previously addressed by Serverless, largely due to its origin in cloud computing. To achieve this, we formally model an energy-aware resource scheduling problem in Serverless edge computing, given a cluster of battery-operated and renewable-energy powered nodes. Then, we devise zone-oriented and priority-based algorithms to improve the operational availability of bottleneck nodes. As assets, our algorithm coins terms “sticky offloading” and “warm scheduling” in the interest of the Quality of Service (QoS). We evaluate our proposal against well-known benchmarks using real-world implementations on a cluster of Raspberry Pis enabled with container orchestration, Kubernetes, and Serverless computing, OpenFaaS, where edge nodes are powered by real-world solar irradiation. Experimental results achieve significant improvements, up to 33%, in helping bottleneck node's operational availability while preserving the QoS. With energy awareness, now Serverless can unconditionally offer its resource efficiency and portability at the edge.<sep>Of the main challenges to keep the edge computing dream alive is to efficiently manage the energy consumption of highly resource-limited nodes. Past studies have limited or often simplistic focus on energy consumption factors considering computation or communication-only solutions, questioned by either costly hardware instrumentation or inaccurate software-specific limitations. With this gap in mind and the wide adoption of single-board computers (SBCs) such as Raspberry Pis in edge, in this paper, we propose a novel holistic and accurate energy measurement approach in edge computing. Exploring a Test and Learn strategy, (1) we firstly perform a comprehensive analysis of identifying factors affecting energy consumption of edge nodes; (2) we develop and utilize WattEdge, a standard framework to evaluate the identified factors; (3) we conduct extensive empirical experiments on Raspberry Pis to thoroughly and uniformly assess the significance of each factor, thereby proposing an all-inclusive energy model. Wattedge is able to measure energy consumption factors such as CPU, memory, storage, a combination of them, connectivity, bandwidth usage, and communication protocols, as well as energy sources such as batteries. The results specifically warn us of the necessity of considering previously underestimated factors such as connectivity. A Smart Agriculture use case is implemented to validate the performance of the energy model, demonstrating a 95% accuracy.<sep>Serverless edge systems simplify the deployment of real-time AI-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications at the edge. However, the heterogeneity of edge computing nodes – in terms of both hardware and software – makes load balancing challenging in these systems. In this paper, we propose a performance-driven, empirical weight-tuning approach to achieve effective load balancing based on the characteristics and capabilities of the nodes. By extensively profiling the nodes, we gather knowledge on performance metrics such as throughput, energy efficiency, response time, AI accuracy, and cost. Using this acquired knowledge, we introduce a weighted round-robin strategy to optimize the performance metrics according to their observed significance. To address multiple objectives, we introduce a multi-objective method that aims to strike a balance between any arbitrary set of performance objectives simultaneously. Additionally, we explore a coordinated distributed approach to overcome the limitations of centralized load balancing. Next, we introduce Hedgi, a heterogeneous serverless edge architecture designed to efficiently configure and utilize the derived load balancing policies, validated empirically. To demonstrate the practicality of Hedgi, we containerize and serverlessize a real-time object detection application. Extensive empirical studies are conducted using Hedgi to evaluate the performance of the proposed load balancing approach. The results provide valuable insights into the design trade-offs of various load balancing policies and system designs in the heterogeneous serverless edge.<sep>Resource management in computing is a very challenging problem that involves making sequential decisions. Resource limitations, resource heterogeneity, dynamic and diverse nature of workload, and the unpredictability of fog/edge computing environments have made resource management even more challenging to be considered in the fog landscape. Recently Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based solutions are adopted to solve this problem. AI/ML methods with the capability to make sequential decisions like reinforcement learning seem most promising for these type of problems. But these algorithms come with their own challenges such as high variance, explainability, and online training. The continuously changing fog/edge environment dynamics require solutions that learn online, adopting changing computing environment. In this paper, we used standard review methodology to conduct this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to analyze the role of AI/ML algorithms and the challenges in the applicability of these algorithms for resource management in fog/edge computing environments. Further, various machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques for edge AI management have been discussed. Furthermore, we have presented the background and current status of AI/ML-based Fog/Edge Computing. Moreover, a taxonomy of AI/ML-based resource management techniques for fog/edge computing has been proposed and compared the existing techniques based on the proposed taxonomy. Finally, open challenges and promising future research directions have been identified and discussed in the area of AI/ML-based fog/edge computing.<sep>Resource management in computing is a very challenging problem that involves making sequential decisions.

This provides its own opportunity to decrease latency and address data privacy concerns along with the ability to reduce public cloud costs. The serverless computing model provides a potential solution with its event-driven architecture to reduce the need for ever-running servers and convert the backend services to an as-used model. This model is an attractive prospect in edge computing environments with varying workloads and limited resources. Furthermore, its setup on the edge of the network promises reduced latency to the edge devices communicating with it and eliminates the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. In this book chapter, first, we introduce the novel concept of serverless edge computing, then, we analyze the performance of multiple serverless platforms, namely, OpenFaaS, AWS Greengrass, Apache OpenWhisk, when set up on the single-board computers (SBCs) on the edge and compare it with public cloud serverless offerings, namely, AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, to deduce the suitability of serverless architectures on the network edge. These serverless platforms are set up on a cluster of Raspberry Pis, and we evaluate their performance by simulating different types of edge workloads. The evaluation results show that OpenFaaS achieves the lowest response time on the SBC edge computing infrastructure, while serverless cloud offerings are the most reliable with the highest success rate.<sep>Optimization is an inseparable part of Cloud computing, particularly with the emergence of Fog and Edge paradigms. Not only these emerging paradigms demand reevaluating cloud-native optimizations and exploring Fog and Edge-based solutions, but also the objectives require significant shift from considering only latency to energy, security, reliability and cost. Hence, it is apparent that optimization objectives have become diverse and lately Internet of Things (IoT)-specific born objectives must come into play. This is critical as incorrect selection of metrics can mislead the developer about the real performance. For instance, a latency-aware auto-scaler must be evaluated through latency-related metrics as response time or tail latency; otherwise the resource manager is not carefully evaluated even if it can reduce the cost. Given such challenges, researchers and developers are struggling to explore and utilize the right metrics to evaluate the performance of optimization techniques such as task scheduling, resource provisioning, resource allocation, resource scheduling and resource execution. This is challenging due to (1) novel and multi-layered computing paradigm, e.g., Cloud, Fog and Edge, (2) IoT applications with different requirements, e.g., latency or privacy, and (3) not having a benchmark and standard for the evaluation metrics. In this paper, by exploring the literature, (1) we present a taxonomy of the various real-world metrics to evaluate the performance of cloud, fog, and edge computing; (2) we survey the literature to recognize common metrics and their applications; and (3) outline open issues for future research. This comprehensive benchmark study can significantly assist developers and researchers to evaluate performance under realistic metrics and standards to ensure their objectives will be achieved in the production environments.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Distortion (music)<sep>In situ<sep>Slicing<sep>Electronics<sep>Quality assurance<sep>Digital image processing<sep>Software<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Benchmark (surveying)<sep>Flexibility (engineering)<sep>Beam (structure)<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Image resolution<sep>Aerospace<sep>Benchmarking<sep>Cathode ray</keyword><title>Pilot Attempt to Benchmark Spatial Resolution of an Electronic Imaging System Prototype for In-Process Electron Beam Melting Monitoring<sep>Benchmarking spatial resolution in electronic imaging for potential in-situ Electron Beam Melting monitoring<sep>Image Generation from STL Models and its Potential Role in Layer-Quality Evaluation for the Electron Beam Melting Process<sep>Pilot investigation of feedback electronic image generation in electron beam melting and its potential for in-process monitoring<sep>Pilot feedback electronic imaging at elevated temperatures and its potential for in-process electron beam melting monitoring</title><abstract>Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is an increasingly used Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique employed by many industrial sectors, including the medical device and aerospace industries.

In-situ EBM monitoring for quality assurance purposes has been a popular research area. Electronic imaging has recently been investigated as one of the in-situ EBM data collection methods, alongside thermal / optical imaging techniques. So far, the disseminations focus on the design of an electronic imaging system and the ability to generate electronic images in-situ, experiments are yet to be carried out to benchmark one of the most important features of any imaging systems – spatial resolution. This article addresses this knowledge gap by: (1) proposing an indicator for the estimation of spatial resolution which includes the Backscattered Electrons (BSE) information depth, (2) estimating the achievable spatial resolution when electronic imaging is carried out inside an Arcam A1 EBM machine, and (3) presenting an experimental method to conduct a knife edge test with the EBM machine. Analyses of experimental results indicated that the spatial resolution was of the order of 0.3 to 0.4 mm when electronic imaging was carried out at room temperature.

In EBM process monitoring, data analysis for processed layer quality evaluation is currently focused on the extraction of information from the raw data collected in-EBM process, i.e. thermal/ optical / electronic images, and the comparison between the collected data and the Computed Tomography (CT)/ microscopy images generated post-EBM process. This article postulates that a stack of bitmaps could be generated from the 3D model at a range of Z heights during file preparation of the EBM process, and serve as a reference image set. In-EBM process comparison between that and the workpiece images collected during the EBM process could then be used for quality assessment purposes. In addition, despite the extensive literature on 3D model slicing and contour generation for AM process preparation, no methods regarding image generation from cross sections of the 3D models have been disseminated in details. This article aims to address this by presenting a piece of 3D model-image generation software. The software is capable of generating binary 3D model reference images with user-defined Region-of-Interest (ROI) of the processing area, and Z heights of the model. It is envisaged that this 3D model-reference image generation ability opens up new opportunities in quality assessment for the in-process monitoring of the EBM process.<sep>Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is an additive manufacturing technique increasingly used by many industrial sectors, including the medical and aerospace industries. The application of this technology is, however, challenged by the lack of process monitoring and control systems to monitor process repeatability and component quality reproducibility. Various monitoring systems, mainly involving thermal and optical cameras, have been employed in previous attempts to study the quality of the EBM process. However, these systems have limitations, which include: (1) images generated unavoidably include monitoring-irrelevant regions beyond the processing area and (2) images are subject to keystone distortion. In this paper, a digital electronic imaging system prototype is described for the Arcam A1 EBM machine. This paper aims to: (1) disseminate the prototype design, (2) demonstrate the prototype ability to overcome limitations of the existing thermal and optical imaging systems, (3) showcase the potential for the prototype to serve as an alternative EBM monitoring technique, and (4) serve as a pilot study for future in-process EBM monitoring research with electronic imaging. Digital electronic images were generated by detecting both secondary electrons and backscattered electrons originating from interactions between the machine electron beam and the processing area using specially designed hardware. Prototype capability experiments at room temperature and approximately 320°C were conducted with digital images being generated and analysed from a Ti-6-Al-4V (as demonstrator material) test build. Results suggest that this prototype has significant potential to be used for in-process monitoring of EBM in many manufacturing sectors.<sep>Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is an increasingly used Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique employed by many industrial sectors, including the medical device and aerospace industries. The application of this technology is, however, challenged by the lack of process monitoring and control system that underpins process repeatability and part quality reproducibility. An electronic imaging system prototype has been developed to serve as an EBM monitoring equipment, the capabilities of which have been verified at room temperature and at 320 ± 10 °C. Nevertheless, in order to fully assess the applicability of this technique, electronic imaging needs to be conducted at a range of elevated temperatures to fully understand the influence of temperature on electronic image quality. Building on top of the previous electronic imaging trials at room temperature, this paper disseminates the essential step changes to allow high temperature electronic imaging: (1) modification of a signal amplifier to deal with high electron beam current during electron beam heating, and (2) design of an open-source electron beam heating algorithm to maximise flexibility for user-defined heating strategy. In this paper, electronic imaging pilot trials at elevated temperatures, ranging from room temperature to 650°C, were carried out. Image quality measure Q of the digital electron images was evaluated, and the influence of temperature was investigated. In this study, raw electronic images generated at higher temperatures had greater Q values, i.e. better global image quality. It has been demonstrated that, for temperatures between 30°C-650°C, the influence of temperature on electronic image quality was not adversely affecting the visual clarity of image features. It is thus envisaged that the prototype has a potential to contribute to in-process EBM monitoring, and this paper has served as a crucial precursor to the ultimate goal of carrying out electronic imaging under real EBM building condition.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/155789/lecturer-senior-lecturer-in-applied-immersive-game-design/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5005009912", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5068718168", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description, particularly in areas of computer graphics, 3D modeling, and game design, with extensive research in cloud computing, AI, and IoT, which are relevant to immersive game design.

We carry out a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen in metabolically engineered HAP1 cells that are auxotrophic for formaldehyde to find this cellular source. We identify histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) as a regulator of cellular formaldehyde production. HDAC3 regulation requires deacetylase activity, and a secondary genetic screen identifies several components of mitochondrial complex I as mediators of this regulation. Metabolic profiling indicates that this unexpected mitochondrial requirement for formaldehyde detoxification is separate from energy generation. HDAC3 and complex I therefore control the abundance of a ubiquitous genotoxic metabolite.<sep>Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) have recently entered the clinic for the treatment of homologous recombination–deficient cancers. Despite the success of this approach, resistance to PARP inhibitors (PARPis) is a clinical hurdle, and it is poorly understood how cancer cells escape the deadly effects of PARPis without restoring BRCA1/2 function. By synergizing the advantages of next-generation sequencing with functional genetic screens in tractable model systems, novel mechanisms providing useful insights into DNA damage response (DDR) have been identified. BRCA1/2 models not only are tools to explore therapy escape mechanisms but also yield basic knowledge about DDR pathways and PARPis’ mechanism of action. Moreover, alterations that render cells resistant to targeted therapies may cause new synthetic dependencies that can be exploited to combat resistant disease.<sep>SUMMARY MDC1 is a key protein in DNA damage signaling. When DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, MDC1 localizes to sites of damage to promote the recruitment of other factors, including the 53BP1-mediated DSB repair pathway. By studying mechanisms of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in BRCA2;p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors, we identified a thus far unknown role of MDC1 in replication fork biology. MDC1 localizes at active replication forks during normal fork replication and its loss reduces fork speed. We show that MDC1 contributes to the restart of replication forks and thereby promotes sensitivity to PARPi and cisplatin. Loss of MDC1 causes MRE11-mediated resection, resulting in delayed fork restart. This improves DNA damage tolerance and causes chemoresistance in BRCA1/2-deficient cells. Hence, our results show a role for MDC1 in replication fork progression that mediates PARPi- and cisplatin-induced DNA damage, in addition to its role in DSB repair.<sep>Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase (PARPi) have entered the clinic for the treatment of homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cancers. Despite the success of this approach, preclinical and clinical research with PARPi has revealed multiple resistance mechanisms, highlighting the need for identification of novel functional biomarkers and combination treatment strategies. Functional genetic screens performed in cells and organoids that acquired resistance to PARPi by loss of 53BP1 identified loss of LIG3 as an enhancer of PARPi toxicity in BRCA1-deficient cells. Enhancement of PARPi toxicity by LIG3 depletion is dependent on BRCA1 deficiency but independent of the loss of 53BP1 pathway. Mechanistically, we show that LIG3 loss promotes formation of MRE11-mediated post-replicative ssDNA gaps in BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1/53BP1 double-deficient cells exposed to PARPi, leading to an accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities. LIG3 depletion also enhances efficacy of PARPi against BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors in mice, suggesting LIG3 as a potential therapeutic target.<sep>BRCA1 and BRCA2 both function in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR). Due to their HR defect, BRCA1/2-deficient cancers are sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis), but they eventually acquire resistance. Preclinical studies yielded several PARPi resistance mechanisms that do not involve BRCA1/2 reactivation, but their relevance in the clinic remains elusive. To investigate which BRCA1/2-independent mechanisms drive spontaneous resistance in vivo, we combine molecular profiling with functional analysis of HR of matched PARPi-naive and PARPi-resistant mouse mammary tumors harboring large intragenic deletions that prevent reactivation of BRCA1/2. We observe restoration of HR in 62% of PARPi-resistant BRCA1-deficient tumors but none in the PARPi-resistant BRCA2-deficient tumors. Moreover, we find that 53BP1 loss is the prevalent resistance mechanism in HR-proficient BRCA1-deficient tumors, whereas resistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors is mainly induced by PARG loss. Furthermore, combined multi-omics analysis identifies additional genes and pathways potentially involved in modulating PARPi response.<sep>(Cancer Cell 33, 1078–1093.e1–e12; June 11, 2018) In the originally published version of this article, the red section (>20%) of the pie chart “Triple-negative breast cancers” in Figure 6D was incorrectly labeled; however, the related numbers stated in the Results section are correct.

Functional genetic screens performed in cells and organoids that acquired resistance to PARPi by loss of 53BP1, identified loss of LIG3 as an enhancer of PARPi toxicity in BRCA1-deficient cells. Enhancement of PARPi toxicity by LIG3 depletion is dependent on BRCA1 deficiency but independent of the loss of 53BP1 pathway. Mechanistically, we show that LIG3 is required for PARPi-induced fork acceleration in BRCA1-deficient cells and that LIG3 loss increases fork asymmetry. Furthermore, LIG3 depletion in BRCA1-deficient cells results in an increase in ssDNA gaps behind the replication forks, resulting in accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities. We also report that high expression of LIG3 in patients with invasive breast cancer correlates in with poorer overall survival, rendering LIG3 as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing PARPi sensitivity.<sep>Inactivating mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes predispose to several types of cancer. Owing to their roles in maintaining genomic stability, lack of BRCA1/2 results in DNA damage repair defects, a vulnerability that can be exploited therapeutically by the inhibition of poly(ADPribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Unfortunately, clinical benefit of PARPi therapy is often limited by emerging drug resistance. Identification of PARPi resistance mechanisms is therefore crucial to improve the clinical outcome and design strategies that would ultimately prevent or target resistant tumors. The use of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer in this work has allowed us to model PARPi resistance in vivo in well-defined genetic contexts. By combining high-throughput genetic screens, multiple omics analyses and functional assays, we identified several factors of PARPi resistance and explained their role in therapy failure. Moreover, we established a new tumor-derived organoid system that enables robust in vivo validation of putative drug resistance factors. Finally, work described in this thesis has advanced our understanding of basic biological processes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair.<sep>Abstract Targeting poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is currently explored as a therapeutic approach to treat various cancer types, but we have a poor understanding of the specific genetic vulnerabilities that would make cancer cells susceptible to such a tailored therapy. Moreover, the identification of such vulnerabilities is of interest for targeting BRCA2;p53-deficient tumors that have acquired resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) through loss of PARG expression. Here, by performing whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens, we identify various genes involved in DNA repair to be essential for the survival of PARG;BRCA2;p53-deficient cells. In particular, our findings reveal EXO1 and FEN1 as major synthetic lethal interactors of PARG loss. We provide evidence for compromised replication fork progression, DNA single-strand break repair, and Okazaki fragment processing in PARG;BRCA2;p53-deficient cells, alterations that exacerbate the effects of EXO1/FEN1 inhibition and become lethal in this context. Since this sensitivity is dependent on BRCA2 defects, we propose to target EXO1/FEN1 in PARPi-resistant tumors that have lost PARG activity. Moreover, EXO1/FEN1 targeting may be a useful strategy for enhancing the effect of PARG inhibitors in homologous recombination-deficient tumors.<sep>Histone H2AX plays a key role in DNA damage signalling in the surrounding regions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1,2 . In response to DNA damage, H2AX becomes phosphorylated on serine residue 139 (known as γH2AX), resulting in the recruitment of the DNA repair effectors 53BP1 and BRCA1 3–6 . Here, by studying resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in BRCA1/2-deficient mammary tumours 7,8 , we identify a novel function for γH2AX in orchestrating drug-induced replication fork degradation. Mechanistically, γH2AX-dependent replication fork degradation is elicited by the inhibition of CtIP-mediated fork protection. As a result, H2AX loss restores replication fork stability and increases chemoresistance in BRCA1/2-deficient tumour cells without restoring homology-directed DNA repair, as highlighted by the lack of DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci. Furthermore, in the attempt to discover acquired genetic vulnerabilities, we find that ATM inhibition overcomes PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in H2AX-deficient tumours by interfering with CtIP-mediated fork protection of stalled forks. In summary, our results demonstrate a novel role for H2AX in replication fork biology in BRCA-deficient tumours and establish a function of H2AX separable from its classical role in DNA damage signalling and DSB repair.<sep>Abstract Somatic hotspot mutations and structural amplifications and fusions that affect fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (encoded by FGFR2 ) occur in multiple types of cancer 1 . However, clinical responses to FGFR inhibitors have remained variable 1–9 , emphasizing the need to better understand which FGFR2 alterations are oncogenic and therapeutically targetable. Here we apply transposon-based screening 10,11 and tumour modelling in mice 12,13 , and find that the truncation of exon 18 (E18) of Fgfr2 is a potent driver mutation. Human oncogenomic datasets revealed a diverse set of FGFR2 alterations, including rearrangements, E1–E17 partial amplifications, and E18 nonsense and frameshift mutations, each causing the transcription of E18-truncated FGFR2 ( FGFR2 ΔE18 ). Functional in vitro and in vivo examination of a compendium of FGFR2 ΔE18 and full-length variants pinpointed FGFR2 -E18 truncation as single-driver alteration in cancer. By contrast, the oncogenic competence of FGFR2 full-length amplifications depended on a distinct landscape of cooperating driver genes. This suggests that genomic alterations that generate stable FGFR2 ΔE18 variants are actionable therapeutic targets, which we confirmed in preclinical mouse and human tumour models, and in a clinical trial. We propose that cancers containing any FGFR2 variant with a truncated E18 should be considered for FGFR-targeted therapies.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Disease<sep>Plasmacytoid dendritic cell<sep>Follicular phase<sep>Transmission (telecommunications)<sep>Vaccination<sep>Homing (biology)<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Asymptomatic<sep>Chemokine receptor<sep>Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cell<sep>Monocyte<sep>T cell<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>Interleukin 12<sep>CXCR3<sep>Interleukin 21<sep>Janus kinase 3<sep>Titer<sep>Antibody<sep>Immune system<sep>Viral shedding<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Airway<sep>Lung<sep>Bronchoalveolar lavage<sep>Convalescence<sep>Immunopathology<sep>CD14<sep>Influenza A virus<sep>Chemokine<sep>Virus<sep>Cytotoxic T cell<sep>Neutralizing antibody<sep>CD8<sep>Myeloid<sep>Medical microbiology<sep>2019-20 coronavirus outbreak</keyword><title>Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from airways in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to serum antibody responses<sep>Delayed generation of functional virus-specific circulating T follicular helper cells correlates with severe COVID-19<sep>Functional myeloid-derived suppressor cells expand in blood but not airways of COVID-19 patients and predict disease severity<sep>Functional monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells increase in blood but not airways and predict COVID-19 severity<sep>Airway antibodies emerge according to COVID-19 severity and wane rapidly but reappear after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination<sep>TOX is expressed by exhausted and polyfunctional human effector memory CD8 <sup>+</sup> T cells<sep>Comparison of Lung-Homing Receptor Expression and Activation Profiles on NK Cell and T Cell Subsets in COVID-19 and Influenza<sep>Influenza A Virus Infection Induces Hyperresponsiveness in Human Lung Tissue-Resident and Peripheral Blood NK Cells<sep>Human influenza virus infection elicits distinct patterns of monocyte and dendritic cell mobilization in blood and the nasopharynx<sep>Respiratory and systemic monocytes, dendritic cells, and myeloid‐derived suppressor cells in COVID‐19: Implications for disease severity<sep>Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 by hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to serum antibody responses<sep>Distinct lung-homing receptor expression and activation profiles on NK cell and T cell subsets in COVID-19 and influenza</title><abstract>Abstract To understand the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients we simultaneously assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, live infectious virus in the airways, and virus-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in sera in 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 could be cultured from four patients, all with low or undetectable antibody response. Our data suggests that the level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may correlate to risk for shedding live SARS-CoV-2 virus in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.<sep>Effective humoral immune responses require well-orchestrated B and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell interactions. Whether these interactions are impaired and associated with COVID-19 disease severity is unclear. Here, longitudinal blood samples across COVID-19 disease severity are analysed. We find that during acute infection SARS-CoV-2-specific circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells expand with disease severity. SARS-CoV-2-specific cTfh cell frequencies correlate with plasmablast frequencies and SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers, avidity and neutralization. Furthermore, cTfh cells but not other memory CD4 T cells, from severe patients better induce plasmablast differentiation and antibody production compared to cTfh cells from mild patients. However, virus-specific cTfh cell development is delayed in patients that display or later develop severe disease compared to those with mild disease, which correlates with delayed induction of high-avidity neutralizing antibodies. Our study suggests that impaired generation of functional virus-specific cTfh cells delays high-quality antibody production at an early stage, potentially enabling progression to severe disease.<sep>Abstract The immunopathology of COVID-19 remains enigmatic, exhibiting immunodysregulation and T cell lymphopenia. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) are T cell suppressors that expand in inflammatory conditions, but their role in acute respiratory infections remains unclear. We studied blood and airways of COVID-19 patients across disease severity at multiple timepoints. M-MDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. M-MDSCs isolated from COVID-19 patients suppressed T cell proliferation and IFNγ production partly via an arginase-1 (Arg-1) dependent mechanism. Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. COVID-19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3ζ chain. Ordinal regression showed that early M-MDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity. In conclusion, M-MDSCs expand in blood of COVID-19 patients, suppress T cells and strongly associate with disease severity, suggesting a role for M-MDSCs in the dysregulated COVID-19 immune response.<sep>The immunopathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains enigmatic, causing immunodysregulation and T cell lymphopenia. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) are T cell suppressors that expand in inflammatory conditions, but their role in acute respiratory infections remains unclear. We studied the blood and airways of patients with COVID-19 across disease severities at multiple time points. M-MDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls. M-MDSCs isolated from patients with COVID-19 suppressed T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production partly via an arginase 1–dependent (Arg-1–dependent) mechanism. Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. Patients with COVID-19 had fewer T cells and downregulated expression of the CD3ζ chain. Ordinal regression showed that early M-MDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity. In conclusion, M-MDSCs expanded in the blood of patients with COVID-19, suppressed T cells, and were strongly associated with disease severity, indicating a role for M-MDSCs in the dysregulated COVID-19 immune response.<sep>Understanding the presence and durability of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the airways is required to provide insights into the ability of individuals to neutralize the virus locally and prevent viral spread. Here, we longitudinally assessed both systemic and airway immune responses upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in a clinically well-characterized cohort of 147 infected individuals representing the full spectrum of COVID-19 severity, from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. In addition, we evaluated how SARS-CoV-2 vaccination influenced the antibody responses in a subset of these individuals during convalescence as compared with naive individuals. Not only systemic but also airway antibody responses correlated with the degree of COVID-19 disease severity. However, although systemic IgG levels were durable for up to 8 months, airway IgG and IgA declined significantly within 3 months. After vaccination, there was an increase in both systemic and airway antibodies, in particular IgG, often exceeding the levels found during acute disease. In contrast, naive individuals showed low airway antibodies after vaccination. In the former COVID-19 patients, airway antibody levels were significantly elevated after the boost vaccination, highlighting the importance of prime and boost vaccinations for previously infected individuals to obtain optimal mucosal protection.<sep>CD8+ T cell exhaustion is a hallmark of many cancers and chronic infections. In mice, T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) maintains exhausted CD8+ T cell responses, whereas thymocyte selection-associated HMG box (TOX) is required for the epigenetic remodeling and survival of exhausted CD8+ T cells. However, it has remained unclear to what extent these transcription factors play analogous roles in humans. In this study, we mapped the expression of TOX and TCF-1 as a function of differentiation and specificity in the human CD8+ T cell landscape. Here, we demonstrate that circulating TOX+ CD8+ T cells exist in most humans, but that TOX is not exclusively associated with exhaustion. Effector memory CD8+ T cells generally expressed TOX, whereas naive and early-differentiated memory CD8+ T cells generally expressed TCF-1. Cytolytic gene and protein expression signatures were also defined by the expression of TOX. In the context of a relentless immune challenge, exhausted HIV-specific CD8+ T cells commonly expressed TOX, often in clusters with various activation markers and inhibitory receptors, and expressed less TCF-1. However, polyfunctional memory CD8+ T cells specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) also expressed TOX, either with or without TCF-1. A similar phenotype was observed among HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from individuals who maintained exceptional immune control of viral replication. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TOX is expressed by most circulating effector memory CD8+ T cell subsets and not exclusively linked to exhaustion.<sep>Respiratory viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses commonly induce a strong infiltration of immune cells into the human lung, with potential detrimental effects on the integrity of the lung tissue. Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, rather little is known about how peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cell and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Here, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus, focusing on the protein and gene expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in recruitment to the lung. For this, we used 28-colour flow cytometry as well as re-analysis of a publicly available single-cell RNA-seq dataset from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Frequencies of NK cells and T cells expressing CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 were altered in peripheral blood of COVID-19 and influenza patients, in line with increased transcript expression of CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 and their respective ligands in BAL fluid. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate a role for CXCR3+, CXCR6+, and/or CCR5+ NK cells and T cells that potentially migrate to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections.<sep>NK cells in the human lung respond to influenza A virus- (IAV-) infected target cells. However, the detailed functional capacity of human lung and peripheral blood NK cells remains to be determined in IAV and other respiratory viral infections. Here, we investigated the effects of IAV infection on human lung and peripheral blood NK cells in vitro and ex vivo following clinical infection. IAV infection of lung- and peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells in vitro induced NK cell hyperresponsiveness to K562 target cells, including increased degranulation and cytokine production particularly in the CD56brightCD16- subset of NK cells. Furthermore, lung CD16- NK cells showed increased IAV-mediated but target cell-independent activation compared to CD16+ lung NK cells or total NK cells in peripheral blood. IAV infection rendered peripheral blood NK cells responsive towards the normally NK cell-resistant lung epithelial cell line A549, indicating that NK cell activation during IAV infection could contribute to killing of surrounding non-infected epithelial cells. In vivo, peripheral blood CD56dimCD16+ and CD56brightCD16- NK cells were primed during acute IAV infection, and a small subset of CD16-CD49a+CXCR3+ NK cells could be identified, with CD49a and CXCR3 potentially promoting homing to and tissue-retention in the lung during acute infection. Together, we show that IAV respiratory viral infections prime otherwise hyporesponsive lung NK cells, indicating that both CD16+ and CD16- NK cells including CD16-CD49a+ tissue-resident NK cells could contribute to host immunity but possibly also tissue damage in clinical IAV infection.<sep>During respiratory viral infections, the precise roles of monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) in the nasopharynx in limiting infection and influencing disease severity are incompletely described. We studied circulating and nasopharyngeal monocytes and DCs in healthy controls (HCs) and in patients with mild to moderate infections (primarily influenza A virus [IAV]). As compared to HCs, patients with acute IAV infection displayed reduced DC but increased intermediate monocytes frequencies in blood, and an accumulation of most monocyte and DC subsets in the nasopharynx. IAV patients had more mature monocytes and DCs in the nasopharynx, and higher levels of TNFα, IL-6, and IFNα in plasma and the nasopharynx than HCs. In blood, monocytes were the most frequent cellular source of TNFα during IAV infection and remained responsive to additional stimulation with TLR7/8L. Immune responses in older patients skewed towards increased monocyte frequencies rather than DCs, suggesting a contributory role for monocytes in disease severity. In patients with other respiratory virus infections, we observed changes in monocyte and DC frequencies in the nasopharynx distinct from IAV patients, while differences in blood were more similar across infection groups. Using SomaScan, a high-throughput aptamer-based assay to study proteomic changes between patients and HCs, we found differential expression of innate immunity-related proteins in plasma and nasopharyngeal secretions of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 patients. Together, our findings demonstrate tissue-specific and pathogen-specific patterns of monocyte and DC function during human respiratory viral infections and highlight the importance of comparative investigations in blood and the nasopharynx.<sep>Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, researchers worldwide have made efforts to understand the mechanisms behind the varying range of COVID-19 disease severity. Since the respiratory tract is the site of infection, and immune cells differ depending on their anatomical location, studying blood is not sufficient to understand the full immunopathogenesis in patients with COVID-19. It is becoming increasingly clear that monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) are involved in the immunopathology of COVID-19 and may play important roles in determining disease severity. Patients with mild COVID-19 display an early antiviral (interferon) response in the nasopharynx, expansion of activated intermediate monocytes, and low levels of M-MDSCs in blood. In contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 seem to lack an early efficient induction of interferons, and skew towards a more suppressive response in blood. This is characterized by downregulation of activation markers and decreased functional capacity of blood monocytes and DCs, reduced circulating DCs, and increased levels of HLA-DRlo CD14+ M-MDSCs. These suppressive characteristics could potentially contribute to delayed T-cell responses in severe COVID-19 cases. In contrast, airways of patients with severe COVID-19 display hyperinflammation with elevated levels of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, and reduced levels of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. These monocyte-derived cells contribute to excess inflammation by producing cytokines and chemokines. Here, we review the current knowledge on the role of monocytes, DCs, and M-MDSCs in COVID-19 and how alterations and the anatomical distribution of these cell populations may relate to disease severity.<sep>Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic. The understanding of the transmission and the duration of viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still limited. Objectives To assess the timeframe and potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to antibody response. Method We performed a cross-sectional study of 36 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Karolinska University Hospital. Patients with more than 8 days of symptom duration were sampled from airways, for PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and in vitro culture of replicating virus. Serum SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies titers were assessed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and microneutralization assay. Results SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in airway samples in 23 patients (symptom duration median 15 days, range 9–53 days), whereas 13 patients were SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative (symptom duration median 21 days, range 10–37 days). Replicating virus was detected in samples from 4 patients at 9–16 days. All but two patients had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in serum, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in 33 out of 36 patients. Total SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated. High levels of both total IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in patients sampled later after symptom onset and in patients where replicating virus could not be detected. Conclusions Our data suggest that the presence of SARS-Cov-2 specific antibodies in serum may indicate a lower risk of shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2 by hospitalized COVID-19 patients.<sep>Abstract Respiratory viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses commonly induce a strong infiltration of immune cells into the lung, with potential detrimental effects on the integrity of the lung tissue. Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, little is known about how blood natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The results reveal a predominant role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in COVID-19 and influenza patients, mirrored by scRNA-seq signatures in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage from publicly available datasets. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation as compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza as compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate migration of functionally competent CXCR3 + , CXCR6 + , and/or CCR5 + NK cells and T cells to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying potential common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections. Author summary The composition of in particular CXCR3 + and/or CXCR6 + NK cells and T cells is altered in peripheral blood upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus in patients with moderate disease. Lung-homing receptor-expression is biased towards phenotypically activated NK cells and T cells, suggesting a functional role for these cells co-expressing in particular CXCR3 and/or CXCR6 upon homing towards the lung.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/166119/postdoctoral-studies-in-translational-microbiome-research/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5049085505", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5051046193", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in tumor biology, DNA damage response, and microbiota-related research, aligning well with the job's focus on microbiota in cancer development and phage therapy.

{"query": "Job description\nAt the department of Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis at the University of Utrecht, a Post-Doc position (initially for twelve months) is available for research towards understanding the physicochemical interactions between phosphate and the active sites within zeolite ZSM-5 with the aim to boost the propylene production in fluid catalytic cracking.\nPropylene is an important raw material for high-performance synthetic polymers. The worldwide demand for propylene is steadily rising, and the present production methods (naphtha steam cracking, and Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC)) cannot keep up with the demand growth. Naphtha crackers in the USA are shifting to shale gas as their main feedstock, which means they make less propylene. This drives the need for more propylene-selectivity in FCC. Propylene-specific FCC catalysts typically contain ZSM-5 zeolites, which have narrower pores than the standard zeolite Y commonly used in FCC. The environment in FCC units is harsh. Catalysts cycle between 550°C and 750°C, in the presence of steam, hydrocarbons, and various poisons. The catalysts thus degrade rapidly. ZSM-5 in propylene additives is therefore often stabilized with phosphorous. The role of this stabilization has been the subject of recent extensive research (see, e.g., H.H. van der Bij, L.R. Aramburo, B Arstad, J.J. Dynes, J. Wang, and B.M. Weckhuysen, ChemPhysChem, 2014, 15, 283-292), but many fundamental questions remain open.\nThe main goal of the research project is to obtain a detailed structural and theoretical understanding of the local structure of phosphate species within the zeolite pore structure with a variety of X-Ray diffraction, X-Ray spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The postdoc’s work will be in acquisition as well as analysis of the data. This detailed analysis will improve our understanding of the mechanism of phosphorus stabilization, and will also allow us to design more efficient routes towards stabilization, and thus more effective use of scarce raw materials. The role of pore blockage and confinement versus changes in acidity will be weighed in establishing the main causes for the increased stability of FCC-based ZSM-5 catalysts.\nQualifications\nThe candidate should have:\nA Ph.D in Inorganic Chemistry and/or Heterogeneous Catalysis or equivalent;\nProven experience and affinity with X-ray diffraction (structure solution) and absorption techniques, affinity with theoretical chemistry;\nA good publication record;\nGood writing and communication skills;\nGood command of written and oral English;\nThe ability to operate in multi-sidciplinary teams;\nBe able to convey enthusiasm to collegues and students.\nOffer\nThe candidate is offered a full-time position for one year, with a possibility to extend to 18-24 months depending on experience.\nThe salary is supplemented with a holiday bonus of 8% and an end-of-year bonus of 8,3% per year. In addition we offer: a pension scheme, a partially paid parental leave, flexible employment conditions. Conditions are based on the Collective Labour Agreement Dutch Universities. The research group will provide the candidate with necessary support on all aspects of the project. The gross salary, depending on the candidate’s qualifications, is in the range between € 2.532,- (scale 10) and maximum € 4.654,- (scale 11) per month.

The role of MOFs as catalyst precursors and the crucial impact of metal coordination on the catalyst activity and leaching are elucidated by comparing MOFs constructed from different clusters and linkers. The stronger the coordination bond of organic linkers to the Ni center, the lower the catalytic activity of the MOF, as shown for CPO-27(Ni). The highest activity and stability were obtained with the [Ni3(ndc)3(DMF)2((CH3)2NH)2]n catalyst.<sep>A chiral zirconium-based catalyst, DUT-67-Pro containing 8-connected Zr6-clusters is obtained by post synthetic functionalization of Zr6O6(OH)2(TDC)4(HCOO)2 (DUT-67, TDC = 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate) with the chiral monocarboxylic acid, L-proline. 13C and 15N solid state MAS and DNP NMR studies of DUT-67-Pro confirm the integration of L-proline into the porous framework. The chiral MOF catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic activity at low temperature (298 K) with an unprecedented syn-(S,S)-product selectivity in an asymmetric aldol addition reaction of cyclohexanone to 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (yield = 95%, ee = 96%). Comparative catalytic studies using a molecular Zr6-cluster model compound indicate the Zr6-moiety to be responsible for this inverse diastereoselectivity compared to well-established L-proline organocatalysis and a mechanism is proposed to explain the Zr6-cluster-mediated syn-selectivity. Masking residual acidic active sites in the cluster of the framework was found to be a key prerequisite to achieve the high enantioselectivity. The purely heterogeneous catalytic system based on DUT-67-Pro is highly stable and can be recycled several times.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Dopant<sep>Contact resistance<sep>van der Waals force<sep>Doping<sep>Graphene<sep>Spintronics<sep>Insulator (electricity)<sep>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy<sep>Electron paramagnetic resonance<sep>Dangling bond<sep>Interface (matter)<sep>Chemical vapor deposition<sep>Molybdenum disulfide<sep>Photoemission spectroscopy<sep>Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy<sep>Heterojunction<sep>Van Hove singularity<sep>Schottky barrier<sep>Excited state<sep>Monolayer<sep>Valence (chemistry)<sep>Dipole<sep>Trapping<sep>Semiconductor<sep>Zigzag<sep>Transmission electron microscopy<sep>Ferromagnetism<sep>Penning trap</keyword><title>Determination of energy thresholds of electron excitations at semiconductor/insulator interfaces using trap-related displacement currents<sep><i>(Invited) </i>Stoner Ferromagnetism in Two-Dimensional Materials<sep>Contact resistance at graphene/MoS2 lateral heterostructures<sep>Band alignment at interfaces of two-dimensional materials: internal photoemission analysis<sep>Doping-induced ferromagnetism in InSe and SnO monolayers<sep>Impact of CVD chemistry on band alignment at the MoS2/SiO2 interface<sep>Contact resistance at 2D metal/semiconductor heterostructures<sep>First-Principles Study of the Contact Resistance at 2D Metal/2D Semiconductor Heterojunctions<sep>Analysis of Transferred MoS<sub>2</sub> Layers Grown by MOCVD: Evidence of Mo Vacancy Related Defect Formation<sep>(Invited) Stoner Ferromagnetism in Two-Dimensional Materials</title><abstract>Spectral measurements of illumination-induced displacement currents related to trapping of charge carriers optically excited in semiconductor electrodes are shown to deliver information regarding energy onsets of electron transitions at the interface.

We discuss here results from first-principles simulations on the p-type doping induced Stoner ferromagnetism in these 2D materials. Hole doping, induced by intrinsic and extrinsic point defects is considered. Metal vacancies are found to produce shallow spin-polarized gap states near the valence band edge, leading to a p-type behavior. Among the investigated potential extrinsic defects (dopants), As substitution of the oxygen atoms in SnO or Bi substitution of the selenium atoms in InSe appears to be good candidates for the hole doping of these 2D materials.<sep>The contact resistance at two-dimensional graphene/MoS2 lateral heterojunctions is theoretically studied, using first-principles simulations based on density functional theory and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. The computed contact resistance lies in the range of 102 to 104 Ω μm, depending on the contact edge symmetry (armchair or zigzag) and termination (Mo and/or S terminated). This large variation in the contact resistance arises from the variation in the interface barrier height, which is sensitive to the presence of polar C-Mo bonds or sulfur dangling bonds at the interface. These results highlight that the control of the edge symmetry and/or edge termination is crucial to achieve a low contact resistance (in the range of a few hundred ohms micrometer) at graphene/MoS2 lateral heterojunctions for 2D material-based field-effect devices.<sep>The article overviews experimental results obtained by applying internal photoemission (IPE) spectroscopy methods to characterize electron states in single- or few-monolayer thick two-dimensional materials and at their interfaces. Several conducting (graphene) and semiconducting (transitional metal dichalcogenides MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2) films on top of thermal SiO2 have been analyzed by IPE, which reveals significant sensitivity of interface band offsets and barriers to the details of the material and interface fabrication, indicating violation of the Schottky–Mott rule. This variability is associated with charges and dipoles formed at the interfaces with van der Waals bonding as opposed to the chemically bonded interfaces of three-dimensional semiconductors and metals. Chemical modification of the underlying SiO2 surface is shown to be a significant factor, affecting interface barriers due to violation of the interface electroneutrality.<sep>Hole-doping of GaX, InX (X = S or Se) and SnO monolayers is predicted to induce a stable ferromagnetic order in these two-dimensional materials, making them potentially interesting for nanoscaled spintronic devices. Ferromagnetism in these materials arises from their peculiar Mexican-hat valence band edge structure, which leads to a Stoner instability. We discuss here the results from first-principles simulations on the p-type doping-induced ferromagnetism in these 2D materials. Hole-doping, induced by intrinsic and extrinsic point defects, is considered. Metal vacancies are found to produce shallow spin-polarized gap states near the valence band edge, leading to a p-type behavior. Among the investigated potential extrinsic defects (dopants), As substitution of the oxygen atoms in SnO or Bi substitution of the selenium atoms in InSe appears to be good candidates for the hole-doping of these 2D materials.<sep>Reliable knowledge of energy alignment of electronic bands at interfaces of few layered Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2) is crucial for designing MoS2 based electronic devices. In this work, we have applied internal photoemission spectroscopy (IPE) to characterize this band alignment. MoS2 films grown on SiO2(50 nm)/Si using two different methods have been analyzed by IPE to determine the energy position of the semiconductor valence band (VB) relative to the reference level of the insulator conduction band (CB). We found that changing the MoS2 growth method from Vapor Phase Reaction (VPR) of MoO3 and sulfur, to Solid Precursor Film (SPF) of sulfurized AHM-NaOH spin coated MoS2 film, results in significant (≈600 meV) enhancement in the electron barrier. Such effects are ascribed to the interaction of hydroxy groups from NaOH and AHM promoters with the SiO2 surface leading to interface dipole modification.<sep>The contact resistance at metal/two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor heterojunctions is currently a major issue for the integration of 2D materials in new generations of nanoelectronic devices. In this chapter, the contact resistance at graphene/MoS2 and 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructures is computed using first-principles simulations, based on density-functional theory and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. The contact resistance, RcW, is found to strongly depend on the edge contact symmetry/termination at graphene/MoS2 contacts, varying between about 2 × 102 and 2 × 104 Ω μm. This large variation in RcW is correlated to the presence or absence of dangling bond defects and/or polar bonds at the interface. On the other hand, the large computed contact resistance at pristine 1T/2H-MoS2 contacts, in the range of 3–4 × 104 Ω μm, is related to the large electron energy barrier (about 0.8 eV) at the interface. The functionalization of the metallic 1T-MoS2 contact by various adsorbates is predicted to decrease the contact resistance by about two orders of magnitude, being promising for device applications.<sep>The high contact resistance at metal/two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor junctions is a major issue for the integration of 2D materials in nanoelectronic devices. We review here recent theoretical results on the contact resistance at lateral heterojunctions between graphene or 1T-MoS2 with 2H-MoS2 monolayers. The transport properties at these junctions are computed using density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green’s function method. The contact resistance is found to strongly depend on the edge contact symmetry/termination at graphene/2H-MoS2 contacts, varying between about 2 × 102 and 2 × 104 Ω∙μm. This large variation is correlated to the presence or absence of dangling bond defects and/or polar bonds at the interface. On the other hand, the large computed contact resistance at pristine 1T/2H-MoS2 junctions, in the range of 3–4 × 104 Ω.μm, is related to the large electron energy barrier (about 0.8 eV) at the interface. The functionalization of the metallic 1T-MoS2 contact by various adsorbates is predicted to decrease the contact resistance by about two orders of magnitude, being very promising for device applications.<sep>A low-temperature multi-frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) study has been carried out on 1, 3.5, and 6 layer thick MoS 2 films, grown by metal organic vapor deposition (MOCVD) and subsequently transferred on SiO 2 /Si. This reveals the observation of a previously unreported, nearly isotropic signal at g ≈ 1.9998 with corresponding spin center (spin S = ½) densities ranging from ∼6 × 10 8 cm −2 to ∼5 × 10 11 cm −2 . The ESR investigation is closely combined with an in-depth analysis by an assortment of other experimental techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to ultimately result in the assignment of the ESR signal to a defect of intrinsic nature, most likely a Mo vacancy (V Mo ) related defect located at MoS 2 grain edges or boundaries. The oxidation of the 2D material at grain edges and boundaries combined with the applied water-based transfer procedure is demonstrated to play a crucial role in the generation of the newly observed defect, thus advising caution with the currently applied process method. The presented analysis, which combines a variety of experimental techniques, contributes to the fine-tuning of the CVD growth and transfer process of high-quality few-layer MoS 2 intended for next-generation nanoelectronic devices.<sep>Two dimensional (2D) materials are currently attracting considerable interest due to their promising applications in future nanoelectronic devices. Ferromagnetic 2D materials are also gaining attention, for their possible use in novel spintronic devices [1]. Hole-doping in monolayers of GaX, InX (X=S or Se) and SnO has been recently predicted to induce a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in these 2D materials, for typical hole densities in the range of 10 13 -10 14 /cm 2 [2-6]. Ferromagnetism in these materials arises from an exchange splitting of electronic states at the top of the valence band, where the density of states exhibits a sharp van Hove singularity, resulting in a so-called Stoner (magnetic) instability; this behavior is typical of materials with “Mexican-hat” energy band edges, as predicted in GaX, InX and SnO monolayers. In this talk, the results from first-principles simulations of the hole-doping induced Stoner ferromagnetism in various 2D materials will be discussed. The possibility to dope these materials with holes, either by intrinsic or extrinsic defects, will be considered. The possible Stoner ferromagnetism in other 2D metal oxides will also be highlighted.

Cai et al bring up the issue of overlap of study patients in systematic reviews and point out to 2 case series that overlapped in recruitment period and geographic location [3, 4]. Although patient overlap in the same analysis for the same outcome can exaggerate the weight of a particular cohort, it is important to note that these 2 series did not overlap in most of the analyses such as laboratory findings, treatment, and pregnancy-related complications because these outcomes were reported by only 1 of the studies (Tables 4 and 5) [2]. Nevertheless, a third study has in fact been withdrawn [5]. Therefore, we have reanalyzed the main outcome of our review by removing the smaller potentially overlapping study [3]...<sep>Descriptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have focused on the nonpregnant adult population. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnancy.We searched databases from December 2019 to 30 April 2020. Eligible studies reported clinical characteristics, radiological findings, and/or laboratory testing of pregnant women during infection. Data were pooled across studies using a random-effects model.Twenty-four studies (136 women) were included. The most common symptoms were fever (62.9%) and cough (36.8%). Laboratory findings included elevated C-reactive protein (57%) and lymphocytopenia (50%). Ground-glass opacity was the most common radiological finding (81.7%). Preterm birth rate was 37.7% and cesarean delivery rate was 76%. There was 1 maternal death. There were 2 fetal COVID-19 cases.The clinical picture in pregnant women with COVID-19 did not differ from the nonpregnant population; however, the rate of preterm birth and cesarean delivery are considerably higher than international averages.<sep>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a frequently observed complication of pregnancy and is associated with an elevated risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Many women with GDM will go on to have future pregnancies, and these pregnancies may or may not be affected by GDM. We conducted a literature search, and based on data from key studies retrieved during the search, we describe the epidemiology of GDM recurrence. This includes a summary of the observed clinical risk factors of increasing maternal age, weight, ethnicity, and requirement for insulin in the index pregnancy. We then present our data from Mayo Clinic (January 2013-December 2017) which identifies a GDM recurrence rate of 47.6%, and illustrates the relevance of population-based studies to clinical practice. Lastly, we examine the available evidence on strategies to prevent GDM recurrence, and note that more research is needed to evaluate the effect of interventions before, during and after pregnancy.<sep>Monochorionic (MC) twins are hemodynamically connected by vascular anastomoses within the single shared placenta. The transfer of fluid or blood from one fetus to the other may result in development of pathologic complications, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin anemia polycythemia sequence, selective intrauterine growth restriction, and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence. Monoamniotic gestations, which comprise a small fraction of MC pregnancies, can also present with unique challenges, particularly antepartum umbilical cord entanglement. All these complications carry a high risk of fetal morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed in a timely fashion.The purpose of this article is to review evidence-based management of complicated MC twin gestations and propose a standardized approach to surveillance.Monochorionic gestations account for the majority of complications that occur in twin pregnancies; however, there is unclear evidence on the appropriate surveillance for and management of specific complications associated with these pregnancies.This article summarizes management for each specific type of MC complication in a structured and clear manner.Early pregnancy ultrasound, ideally between 10 and 13 weeks' gestation, is critical for the diagnosis and characterization of twin pregnancies. To improve outcomes for MC twins, appropriate fetal surveillance should be initiated at 16 weeks' gestation and continued until delivery.<sep>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) with intact atrial septum (HLHS-IAS) carries a high risk of mortality and affects about 6% of all patients with HLHS. Fetal interventions, postnatal transcatheter interventions, and postnatal surgical resection have all been used, but the mortality risk continues to be high in this subgroup of patients. We describe a novel, sequential approach to manage HLHS-IAS and progressive fetal hydrops. A 28-year-old, gravida 4 para 2 mother was referred to Mayo Clinic for fetal HLHS. Fetal echocardiography at 28 weeks of gestation demonstrated HLHS-IAS with progressive fetal hydrops. The atrial septum was thick and muscular with no interatrial communication. Ultrasound-guided fetal atrial septostomy was performed with successful creation of a small atrial communication. However, fetal echocardiogram at 33 weeks of gestation showed recurrence of a pleural effusion and restriction of the atrial septum. We proceeded with an Ex uteroIntrapartum Treatment (EXIT) delivery and open atrial septectomy. This was performed successfully, and the infant was stabilized in the intensive care unit. The infant required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support on day of life 1. The patient later developed hemorrhagic complications, leading to his demise on day of life 9. This is the first reported case of an EXIT procedure and open atrial septectomy performed without cardiopulmonary bypass for an open-heart operation and provides a promising alternative strategy for the management of HLHS-IAS in select cases.<sep>INTRODUCTION: Recent diabetes research has evaluated use of digital glucose logging and smartphone apps, and suggests improvement in glucose control with the new technology. A quality initiative was implemented in a maternal fetal medicine division at a tertiary care center which transitioned from paper glucose logging to digital glucose logging for diabetic patients. Our objective was to assess patient perspectives of logging methods before and after the change. METHODS: The quality initiative was started in July 2021, when all diabetic patients were instructed on digital glucose logging and communication. The digital log system involved logging glucose values in an app integrated with the electronic medical record and communicating with providers via the electronic medical record. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire both before and after the quality initiative, assessing ease of use, real-time logging, daily compliance, communication quality, and overall satisfaction with paper logging. The scoring system was based on a Likert scale: 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). RESULTS: From July to October 2021, 11 patients transitioned from paper to digital logging and completed both questionnaires. Of those, 88% preferred digital logging. Digital logging had higher scores for ease of use (4 vs. 3.6) and overall satisfaction (3.9 vs. 3.3). Digital logging had lower scores for real-time logging (2.8 vs. 3.1) and effective communication (3.8 vs. 4.1). CONCLUSION: Because of the higher ease of use and satisfaction scores, ultimately digital glucose logging could lead to improved compliance and, thus, better glycemic control during pregnancy.<sep>INTRODUCTION: The influence of concurrent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) on clinical outcomes of patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) remains incompletely characterized, with authors describing harmful and beneficial relationships with regards to maternal mortality or requirement for cardiac transplantation. METHODS: Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL and Scopus were searched for combinations of the following terminology: hypertension, preeclampsia, cardiomyopathy, peripartum, postpartum or puerperium. Eligibility criteria included all articles addressing mortality rates of PPCM with and without HDP using a combination of the European Society of Cardiology 2010 and the National Heart Lung Blood Institute 2000 diagnostic criteria. Two independent reviewers analyzed abstracts and article text to determine eligibility and risk of bias. Risk of bias was determined using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and a Peto fixed effects model was used to combine odds ratios in a meta-analytic fashion due to the relatively rare frequency of these events. RESULTS: 1838 articles were identified using the search strategy; 148 full text articles were reviewed for eligibility, with 10 observational studies meeting criteria. There was substantial agreement between the two raters for selection (K: 0.799) and for risk of bias (K: 0.851). An overall protective effect was identified [0.565 (95% CI 0.327, 0.974)], with a low degree of heterogeneity (I2 17.66%). No significant differences were found between subgroups-chronic hypertension, access to social medicine, high-income countries and post-diagnosis duration of care greater than 12 months. CONCLUSION: Although the strength of association is weak, concurrent HDP appears to be protective against mortality and need for cardiac transplantation in PPCM.<sep>INTRODUCTION: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) and cardiomyopathy secondary to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are considered to represent distinct cardiac entities (i.e. dilated vs hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine if HDP alters the odds of recovery and if baseline left ventricle characteristics are significantly different. METHODS: Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL and Scopus were searched for combinations of the following: hypertension, preeclampsia, cardiomyopathy, peripartum, postpartum or puerperium. Articles describing initial left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), odds of recovery (EF &gt;50%) or end diastolic diameter (EDD) amongst those with PPCM were included. Two raters analyzed abstracts and full text to determine eligibility and risk of bias. Risk of bias was determined using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the DerSimonian-Laird method was used to combine odds ratios. RESULTS: 1838 articles were identified and 148 full text articles were reviewed for eligibility, with 11 observational studies meeting criteria. There was substantial agreement for selection (K: 0.817) and for risk of bias (K: 0.633) between raters. There was no significant difference (mean: 1.837%, 95% CI-4.882, 1.282) in baseline LVEF or EDD (1.837 cm, 95% CI-1.104, 4.778) between patients who developed PPCM +/- HDP. Further, recovery rates between groups were similar with OR of 1.870 (95% CI 0.854, 4.094) and a moderate degree of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Counseling regarding eventual recovery of LVEF after PPCM should not be altered due to the presence of HDP; it is unlikely that a phenotypic difference exists in the cardiomyopathy induced by HDP compared to idiopathic PPCM.<sep>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease affecting multiple joints and can also be a systemic widespread, affecting major organs. Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with greater adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in comparison to the general obstetric population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate the pregnancy outcomes in RA patients in comparison to the general pregnant population.Nine studies involving 11,999 RA patients met the eligibility criteria with 9,921,808 controls. Rheumatoid arthritis patients were compared with their control counterparts according to random-effects model statistical analysis.We searched databases from inception to September 8, 2021. Eligible studies reported maternal outcomes (preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and preterm delivery) and/or neonatal outcomes. Data were pooled across using random-effects model. Subgroup analysis was conducted on RA patients alone. The review was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42021250521).In terms of maternal outcomes, there was an increased rate of cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR], 1.55), preeclampsia (OR, 1.61), and preterm delivery (OR, 1.83) in RA patients compared with their control counterparts. In terms of neonatal outcomes, a higher rate of lower gestational weight (mean difference [MD], -0.19 kg), requirement for neonate intensive care unit admission (OR, 1.34), and stillbirths (OR, 1.99) were observed in RA patients compared with the controls. A subgroup analysis of 4 studies involving only RA patients (n = 3761) was conducted. A total of 33.2% of patients had a cesarean delivery, 7.3% had preeclampsia, 14.8% had a preterm delivery, and 9.5% of neonates had low birth weight.Compared with the general pregnant population, women with RA tend to have a higher risk of maternal and neonatal complications. As a result, this study hopes to increase awareness into the importance of counseling and managing RA patients.<sep>Socioeconomic disparities play an important role in disease epidemiology and outcome. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether pregnant women with Coronavirus infection living in a food desert, as defined by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are at increased risk of having more severe disease reflected as need for hospitalization. In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed electronic medical records of all pregnant patients with coronavirus in our urban 3-hospital system for demographics, potential co-morbidities and outcomes between April-August 2020. Food deserts were defined by the USDA as low income neighborhoods more than half-mile from a supermarket. The patients’ location was mapped on the Food Access Research Atlas to determine whether each patient lived within a food desert. Comparisons between those with Coronavirus requiring hospitalization and those who remained asymptomatic were made using univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The cohort consisted of 81 pregnant patients with coronavirus, 45% asymptomatic and 55% symptomatic. The majority (70.9%) were Hispanic, and obese (BMI>30 70%) with 27.2% living in a food desert. Symptomatic patients were significantly more likely to reside in a food desert (90.9% versus 41.4%, p<.0001, OR 14.167, 95% CI 3.023, 66.388). No other significant differences were identified on univariate analysis for any demographic or potential confounders. Logistic regression modeling confirmed food desert residence to be the only independent predictor of need for hospitalization in those with Coronavirus in our cohort (see Table 1). The results of this study revealed an association between living in a food desert and developing symptomatic coronavirus. However, with such wide confidence intervals, a larger population analysis is indicated to confirm this association, and if confirmed would serve as an opportunity to change a modifiable socioeconomic risk factor for Coronavirus disease severity in pregnancy.<sep>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention ranks diabetes mellitus (DM) as the seventh leading cause of death in the USA. The most prevalent forms of DM include Type 2 DM, Type 1 DM, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). While the acute problem of diabetic hyperglycemia can be clinically managed through dietary control and lifestyle changes or pharmacological intervention with oral medications or insulin, long-term complications of the disease are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These long-term complications involve nearly all organ systems of the body and share common pathologies associated with endothelial cell abnormalities. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying DM as related to future long-term complications following hyperglycemia, we have undertaken a study to determine the frequency that GDM did or did not occur in the second pregnancy of women who experienced GDM in their first pregnancy between 2013 and 2018 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Within the five-year period of the study, the results indicate that 7,330 women received obstetrical care for pregnancy during the study period. Of these, 150 developed GDM in their first pregnancy and of these, 42 (28%) had a second pregnancy. Of these 42 women, 20 again developed GDM and 22 did not develop GDM in their second pregnancy within the study period. Following the occurrence of GDM in the first pregnancy, the study (1) established the number of women with and without GDM in the second pregnancy and (2) confirmed the feasibility to study diabetic metabolic memory using maternal placental tissue from GDM women. These studies represent Phase I of a larger research project whose goal is to analyze epigenetic mechanisms underlying true diabetic metabolic memory using endothelial cells isolated from the maternal placenta of women with and without GDM as described in this article.<sep>ObjectivesThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the landscape of professional activities, emphasizing virtual meetings and social media (SoMe) presence. Whether cardiothoracic programs increased their SoMe presence is unknown. We examined SoMe use and content creation by cardiothoracic surgery programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsWe searched the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to identify all cardiothoracic surgery residency programs (n = 122), including independent (n = 74), integrated (n = 33), and congenital (n = 15) training programs at 78 US cardiothoracic surgery teaching institutions. We then manually searched Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter to identify the associated residency and departmental accounts. The timeline for our search was between 10/2021 and 4/2022. March 2020 was used as the starting point for the COVID-19 pandemic. We also contacted the account managers to identify account content creators. The data are descriptively reported and analyzed.ResultsOf 137 SoMe accounts from 78 US cardiothoracic surgery teaching institutions, 72 of 137 (52.6%) were on Twitter, 34 of 137 (24.8%) on Facebook, and 31 of 137 (22.6%) on Instagram. Most accounts were departmental accounts (105/137 = 76.6%) versus 32 of 137 (23.4%) training program accounts. Most training program-specific SoMe accounts across all platforms were created after the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas departmental accounts were pre-existing (P < .001). The most pronounced SoMe growth was on Instagram at the training program level, with 91.7% of Instagram accounts created after the pandemic. Trainees are the content creators for 94.4% of residency accounts and 33.3% of departmental accounts. Facebook's presence was stagnant. Congenital training programs did not have a specific SoMe presence.ConclusionsSoMe presence by cardiothoracic surgery training programs and departments has increased during the pandemic. Twitter is the most common platform, with a recent increased trend on Instagram. Trainees largely create content. SoMe education and training pathways may be needed for involved trainees to maximize their benefits.<sep>Key Points Women with severe preeclampsia demonstrate abnormal levels of the complement alternative pathway components. Genetic variants in the complement alternative pathway are more prevalent in those with severe phenotype preeclampsia compared with the general population. Future studies should explore the role of medications that block the complement alternative pathway in treatment of preeclampsia. Background Preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome share many clinical and biologic features with thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes caused by complement abnormalities. Our hypothesis was that similar functional and genetic alterations in the complement alternative pathway (CAP) are present in these disorders of pregnancy. Methods We conducted quantitative analysis of proteins involved in CAP using ELISA and nephelometry on prospectively collected blood samples from patients with severe phenotype preeclampsia (defined as delivery ≤34 weeks due to preeclampsia), HELLP syndrome, or eclampsia, and matched normotensive controls ( n =25 in each arm) between 2011 and 2016. Sequencing was performed to interrogate 14 genes encoding CAP components. Results Both groups were similar in age, gravidity, parity, marital status, and race. The study group had a higher BMI (mean±SD, 32±8 versus 25±4 kg/m 2 ; P =0.002) and earlier gestational age at delivery (32.5±3.6 versus 40.3±1 weeks; P &lt;0.001). Serologic studies demonstrated elevated Bb subunit (median [range], 1.2 [0.5–4.3] versus 0.6 [0.5–1] μ g/ml; P&lt;0.001), complement C5 concentration (28 [18–33] versus 24 [15–34] mg/dl; P =0.03), and sMAC (371 [167–761] versus 184 [112–249] ng/ml; P&lt;0.001) concentrations in patients with preeclampsia. Two thirds of patients with preeclampsia had at least one nonsynonymous sequence variant in CAP genes. Conclusion Patients with severe phenotype preeclampsia manifest functional alterations in CAP activation. Genetic variants in the CAP genes were detected in several patients, but a larger population study is necessary to fully evaluate genetic risk. Genetic screening and complement-targeted treatment may be useful in risk stratification and novel therapeutic approaches.<sep>When below the 5th%, PAPP-A, a component of the first trimester aneuploidy screen (FTS), has been correlated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy-related HTN. With cell free DNA testing (NIPT) now recommended for genetic screening rather than FTS, yet HTN remaining a leading cause of adverse outcomes, we sought to evaluate the relevance of PAPP-A as a biomarker for HTN related complications in pregnancy. This was a single-center retrospective cohort study with a primary outcome of interest defined as a composite of pregnancy-related HTN with/without chronic HTN in those with/without low PAPP-A on FTS. The study was powered to detect a 20% difference between groups, with review of 2450 consecutive women who had an FTS and delivered at our tertiary-level facility from 2011-2017. A cohort of 140 patients were identified with low PAPP-A (>5th% serving as controls). Chart review was conducted for multiple maternal and neonatal outcomes. Comparisons between groups were made for multiple outcomes. Analysis performed using SPSS & SAS. Of 2450 women, 267 (10.90%) met criteria for the composite hypertension (CH) outcome. Of these 267 patients, 39 (14.61%) had low PAPP-A. There was a statistically significant (P<0.01) association with low PAPP-A and risk of CH (OR 3.53 95% CI 2.38-5.23). An ROC curve was generated to determine the optimal PAPP-A percentile cut point for discriminating the CH outcome (Figure 1). The optimal cut point for dichotomizing the PAPP-A percentile predictor in order to discriminate the composite hypertension outcome was determined to be 30.00. In a subsequent adjusted analysis this result remained statistically significant (p <0.01, OR 2.65 95% CI 1.67-4.21). In this adjusted analysis, a low PAPP-A level was identified to be an independent risk factor for the defined CH outcome. Our findings highlight that even in the setting of NIPT being used primarily for aneuploidy screening, PAPP-A evaluation should be further studied and considered as an adjunct to NIPT to aid in maternal risk stratification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)<sep>Magnesium sulfate is used for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia and for fetal neuroprotection when delivery is anticipated before 32 weeks of gestation. Existing risk assessment tools for postpartum hemorrhage often identify the use of magnesium sulfate as an intrapartum risk factor. Previous studies examining the association between the use of magnesium sulfate and postpartum hemorrhage have relied largely on qualitative estimates of blood loss rather than quantitative estimates of blood loss.This study aimed to determine whether intrapartum administration of magnesium sulfate is associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage using a quantitative blood loss assessment via the use of graduated drapes and weight differences in surgical supplies.This case-control study was conducted to test the hypothesis that intrapartum parenteral administration of magnesium sulfate is not independently associated with postpartum hemorrhage. All deliveries at our tertiary-level academic medical center between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. Of note, 2 categories of postpartum hemorrhage were defined: the traditional definition (>500 mL for vaginal delivery and >1000 mL for cesarean delivery) and the contemporary definition (>1000 mL regardless of delivery mode). Statistical analyses using the chi-square test, Fisher exact test, t test, or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were performed to compare the patients who did and did not receive magnesium sulfate concerning the rates of postpartum hemorrhage, pre- and postdelivery hemoglobin level, and rates of blood transfusion.A total of 1318 deliveries were included, with postpartum hemorrhage rates of 12.2% (traditional definition) and 6.2% (contemporary definition). Multivariate logistic regression did not find the use of magnesium sulfate as an independent risk factor by either definition (odds ratio, 1.44 [95% confidence interval, 0.87-2.38] and 1.34 [95% confidence interval, 0.71-2.54]). The only significant independent risk factor was cesarean delivery, by both definitions (odds ratio, 2.71 [95% confidence interval, 1.85-3.98] and 19.34 [95% confidence interval, 8.55-43.72]).In our study population, intrapartum administration of magnesium sulfate was not found to be an independent risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage. Cesarean delivery was determined as an independent risk factor, consistent with previous reports.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Programmed cell death<sep>Neurogenesis<sep>Mitochondrial biogenesis<sep>Gene expression profiling<sep>Axon guidance<sep>Hyperoxia<sep>Disease<sep>Phosphatase<sep>Progenitor cell<sep>Alzheimer's disease<sep>Unfolded protein response<sep>Mitochondrial permeability transition pore<sep>PINK1<sep>ATF4<sep>Bioenergetics<sep>E2F<sep>Regulator<sep>Kinase<sep>Neural stem cell<sep>Cyclin-dependent kinase 5<sep>Subgranular zone<sep>RHOA<sep>E2F1<sep>Isolation (microbiology)<sep>Endoplasmic reticulum<sep>Transcription factor<sep>Neurite<sep>Cell fate determination<sep>Protein kinase A<sep>Cyclin-dependent kinase 2<sep>mitochondrial fusion<sep>Population<sep>microRNA<sep>Glycolysis<sep>Axon<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia<sep>Mitochondrial matrix<sep>DNA<sep>Mitosis<sep>Citric acid cycle<sep>Glutathione<sep>Downregulation and upregulation<sep>Stem cell<sep>Biogenesis<sep>Progenitor<sep>Phosphorylation<sep>Gene expression<sep>Protein kinase B<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Gene<sep>Cognitive decline</keyword><title>The Rb/E2F axis is a key regulator of the molecular signatures instructing the quiescent and activated adult neural stem cell state<sep>Mitotic Activity and DNA Maintenance of Adult Neural Stem Cells is Regulated by Beclin1<sep>MCL-1Matrix maintains neuronal survival by enhancing mitochondrial integrity and bioenergetic capacity under stress conditions<sep>Direct FACS Isolation of Neural Stem/Progenitor Lineages from the Adult Brain<sep>The integrated stress response as a key pathway downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction<sep>Neonatal hyperoxia in mice triggers long-term cognitive deficits via impairments in cerebrovascular function and neurogenesis<sep>DJ-1 modulates the unfolded protein response and cell death via upregulation of ATF4 following ER stress<sep>PFTK1 kinase regulates axogenesis during development via RhoA activation<sep>Early postnatal defects in neurogenesis in the 3xTg mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease<sep>Altered mitochondrial fusion drives defensive glutathione synthesis in cells able to switch to glycolytic ATP production<sep>Cdk5-mediated JIP1 phosphorylation regulates axonal outgrowth through Notch1 inhibition<sep>sncRNAP: Prediction and profiling of full sncRNA repertoires from sRNAseq data<sep>Alterations in neural stem cell quiescence and activation in the 3xTG-AD model of Alzheimer’s Disease<sep>Pink1 regulates <scp>FKBP</scp>5 interaction with <scp>AKT</scp>/<scp>PHLPP</scp> and protects neurons from neurotoxin stress induced by <scp>MPP</scp><sup>+</sup><sep>The pro-death role of Cited2 in stroke is regulated by E2F1/4 transcription factors</title><abstract>Long-term maintenance of the adult neurogenic niche depends on proper regulation of entry and exit from quiescence. Neural stem cell (NSC) transition from quiescence to activation is a complex process requiring precise cell-cycle control coordinated with transcriptional and morphological changes. How NSC fate transitions in coordination with the cell-cycle machinery remains poorly understood. Here we show that the Rb/E2F axis functions by linking the cell-cycle machinery to pivotal regulators of NSC fate. Deletion of Rb family proteins results in activation of NSCs, inducing a transcriptomic transition toward activation. Deletion of their target activator E2Fs1/3 results in intractable quiescence and cessation of neurogenesis. We show that the Rb/E2F axis mediates these fate transitions through regulation of factors essential for NSC function, including REST and ASCL1. Thus, the Rb/E2F axis is an important regulator of NSC fate, coordinating cell-cycle control with NSC activation and quiescence fate transitions.<sep>SUMMARY Beclin1 is a tumor suppressor gene that can regulate proliferation under pathological conditions. Whether Beclin1 has a role in regulating proliferation in physiological conditions remains unknown. Here, through the creation of an inducible transgenic mouse that removes Beclin1 from adult neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) and their progeny we uncovered that Beclin1 is required cell-autonomously to sustain proliferating NSCPs in vivo and ex vivo . Flow cytometry analysis and single-cell RNA-sequencing show that Beclin1 is required for mitosis. Additional analysis of the proliferating NSPCs resolved by stage of cell cycle uncovered that Beclin1-null cells have a distinct differential developmental trajectory accompanied by downregulation of genes involved in chromosomal maintenance and upregulation of cell stress genes upon cell cycle exit. These effects align with DNA damage in Beclin1-null cells and ultimately result in less adult-born granular neurons. Together these data identify Beclin1 as a novel regulator of mitosis in adult NSPCs.<sep>Abstract Mitochondria play a crucial role in neuronal survival through efficient energy metabolism. In pathological conditions, mitochondrial stress leads to neuronal death, which is regulated by the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family of proteins. MCL-1 is an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein localized to mitochondria either in the outer membrane (OM) or inner membrane (Matrix), which have distinct roles in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting bioenergetics, respectively. While the anti-apoptotic role for Mcl1 is well characterized, the protective function of MCL-1 Matrix remains poorly understood. Here, we show MCL-1 OM and MCL-1 Matrix prevent neuronal death through distinct mechanisms. We report that MCL-1 Matrix functions to preserve mitochondrial energy transduction and improves respiratory chain capacity by modulating mitochondrial oxygen consumption in response to mitochondrial stress. We show that MCL-1 Matrix protects neurons from stress by enhancing respiratory function, and by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Taken together, our results provide novel insight into how MCL-1 Matrix may confer neuroprotection under stress conditions involving loss of mitochondrial function.<sep>Adult neural stem and progenitor cells reside in the neurogenic niche of the adult brain and have tremendous potential in regenerative medicine. Compelling evidence suggests that adult neurogenesis plays an important role in hippocampal memory formation, plasticity, and mood regulation. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the function of neural stem/progenitor cells within the brain is a critical step for the development of regenerative strategies to maintain or enhance neurological function. A major challenge in studying these cells is the limited cell number of adult neural stem cells, and the significant changes in their properties induced by in vitro culture and expansion. To best understand the regulation of these cells, they must be studied within their niche context. In this chapter, we provide a simplified protocol for the harvest and isolation of neural stem cell lineages directly from the murine brain, to provide input material for single-cell RNA-seq. This approach will elucidate the true transcriptional signatures and activated pathways in neural stem cell lineages, within the context of their niche environment.<sep>Mitochondrial function is fundamental to maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis, energy production, and dynamics are behind many metabolic diseases affecting particularly the muscular and nervous systems. Therefore, synchronized coordination between organelles is required to sustain homeostasis. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a heavily investigated pathway that allows for communication between organelles, including the mitochondria and the nucleus among others. The ISR slows down protein synthesis in the cytoplasm and modifies the transcriptome in the nucleus following mitochondrial stress. With the help of the ATF4 transcription factor, it promotes metabolic rewiring, amino acid, and antioxidant synthesis to counteract cellular stress. Under chronic stress, the ISR leads to apoptotic cell death. However, the mechanisms as to how the ISR can coordinate cell death and survival depending on the type of insult remain unclear. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms of activation of the ISR under different mitochondrial dysfunctions. We propose a few mechanisms and factors that contribute to the cell-specific response. Finally, we discuss the role of the ISR in neurodegenerative diseases given the important implications of the mitochondria in maintaining healthy neurological function.<sep>Preterm birth is the leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age. Premature infants who receive life-saving oxygen therapy often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease. Infants with BPD are at a high risk of abnormal neurodevelopment, including motor and cognitive difficulties. While neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are crucial for proper brain development, it is unclear whether they play a role in BPD-associated neurodevelopmental deficits. Here, we show that hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD in newborn mice led to lifelong impairments in cerebrovascular structure and function as well as impairments in NPC self-renewal and neurogenesis. A neurosphere assay utilizing nonhuman primate preterm baboon NPCs confirmed impairment in NPC function. Moreover, gene expression profiling revealed that genes involved in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular autoregulation, neuronal formation, and neurotransmission were dysregulated following neonatal hyperoxia. These impairments were associated with motor and cognitive decline in aging hyperoxia-exposed mice, reminiscent of deficits observed in patients with BPD. Together, our findings establish a relationship between BPD and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes and identify molecular and cellular players of neonatal brain injury that persist throughout adulthood that may be targeted for early intervention to aid this vulnerable patient population.<sep>The unfolded protein response (UPR) triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a feature of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the vast majority of PD is sporadic, mutations in a number of genes including PARK7 which encodes the protein DJ-1 have been linked to early-onset, familial PD. In this regard, both PD of sporadic and genetic origins exhibit markers of ER stress-induced UPR. However, the relationship between pathogenic mutations in PARK7 and ER stress-induced UPR in PD pathogenesis remains unclear. In most contexts, DJ-1 has been shown to protect against neuronal injury. However, we find that DJ-1 deficiency ameliorates death in the context of acute ER stress in vitro and in vivo. DJ-1 loss decreases protein and transcript levels of ATF4, a transcription factor critical to the ER response and reduces the levels of CHOP and BiP, its downstream effectors. The converse is observed with DJ-1 over-expression. Importantly, we find that over-expression of wild-type and PD-associated mutant form of PARK7L166P, enhances ER stress-induced neuronal death by regulating ATF4 transcription and translation. Our results demonstrate a previously unreported role for wild-type and mutant DJ-1 in the regulation of UPR and provides a potential link to PD pathogenesis.<sep>PFTK1/Eip63E is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) family and plays an important role in normal cell cycle progression. Eip63E expresses primarily in postnatal and adult nervous system in Drosophila melanogaster but its role in CNS development remains unknown. We sought to understand the function of Eip63E in the CNS by studying the fly ventral nerve cord during development.Our results demonstrate that Eip63E regulates axogenesis in neurons and its deficiency leads to neuronal defects. Functional interaction studies performed using the same system identify an interaction between Eip63E and the small GTPase Rho1. Furthermore, deficiency of Eip63E homolog in mice, PFTK1, in a newly generated PFTK1 knockout mice results in increased axonal outgrowth confirming that the developmental defects observed in the fly model are due to defects in axogenesis. Importantly, RhoA phosphorylation and activity are affected by PFTK1 in primary neuronal cultures. We report that GDP-bound inactive RhoA is a substrate of PFTK1 and PFTK1 phosphorylation is required for RhoA activity.In conclusion, our work establishes an unreported neuronal role of PFTK1 in axon development mediated by phosphorylation and activation of GDP-bound RhoA. The results presented add to our understanding of the role of Cdks in the maintenance of RhoA-mediated axon growth and its impact on CNS development and axonal regeneration.<sep>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. The hippocampus, which is one of the sites where neural stem cells reside and new neurons are born, exhibits the most significant neuronal loss in AD. A decline in adult neurogenesis has been described in several animal models of AD. However, the age at which this defect first appears remains unknown. To determine at which stage, from birth to adulthood, the neurogenic deficits are found in AD, we used the triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg). We show that defects in neurogenesis are present as early as postnatal stages, well before the onset of any neuropathology or behavioral deficits. We also show that 3xTg mice have significantly fewer neural stem/progenitor cells, with reduced proliferation and decreased numbers of newborn neurons at postnatal stages, consistent with reduced volumes of hippocampal structures. To determine whether there are early changes in the molecular signatures of neural stem/progenitor cells, we perform bulk RNA-seq on cells sorted directly from the hippocampus. We show significant changes in the gene expression profiles at one month of age, including genes of the Notch and Wnt pathways. These findings reveal impairments in neurogenesis very early in the 3xTg AD model, which provides new opportunities for early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions to prevent neurodegeneration in AD.<sep>Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles. Alterations in mitochondrial dynamics are causal or are linked to numerous neurodegenerative, neuromuscular, and metabolic diseases. It is generally thought that cells with altered mitochondrial structure are prone to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species generation and widespread oxidative damage. The objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and the master cellular antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). We reveal that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the mitochondrial fusion machinery display elevated levels of GSH, which limits oxidative damage. Moreover, targeted metabolomics and 13C isotopic labeling experiments demonstrate that cells lacking the inner membrane fusion GTPase OPA1 undergo widespread metabolic remodeling altering the balance of citric acid cycle intermediates and ultimately favoring GSH synthesis. Interestingly, the GSH precursor and antioxidant n-acetylcysteine did not increase GSH levels in OPA1 KO cells, suggesting that cysteine is not limiting for GSH production in this context. Post-mitotic neurons were unable to increase GSH production in the absence of OPA1. Finally, the ability to use glycolysis for ATP production was a requirement for GSH accumulation following OPA1 deletion. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel role for mitochondrial fusion in the regulation of GSH synthesis, and suggest that cysteine availability is not limiting for GSH synthesis in conditions of mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings provide a possible explanation for the heightened sensitivity of certain cell types to alterations in mitochondrial dynamics.<sep>Activated Cdk5 regulates a number of processes during nervous system formation, including neuronal differentiation, growth cone stabilization, and axonal growth. Cdk5 phosphorylates its downstream substrates located in axonal growth cones, where the highly expressed c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein1 (JIP1) has been implicated as another important regulator of axonal growth. In addition, stringent control of the level of intracellular domain of Notch1 (Notch1-IC) plays a regulatory role in axonal outgrowth during neuronal differentiation. However, whether Cdk5-JIP1-Notch1 cooperate to regulate axonal outgrowth, and the mechanism of such joint contribution to this pathway, is presently unknown, and here we explore their potential interaction.Our interactome screen identified JIP1 as an interactor of p35, a Cdk5 activator, and we sought to explore the relationship between Cdk5 and JIP1 on the regulation of axonal outgrowth. We demonstrate that JIP1 phosphorylated by Cdk5 at Thr205 enhances axonal outgrowth and a phosphomimic JIP1 rescues the axonal outgrowth defects in JIP1-/- and p35-/- neurons. Axonal outgrowth defects caused by the specific increase of Notch1 in JIP1-/- neurons are rescued by Numb-mediated inhibition of Notch1. Finally, we demonstrate that Cdk5 phosphorylation of JIP1 further amplifies the phosphorylation status of yet another Cdk5 substrate E3-ubiquitin ligase Itch, resulting in increased Notch1 ubiquitination.Our findings identify a potentially critical signaling axis involving Cdk5-JIP1-Itch-Notch1, which plays an important role in the regulation of CNS development. Future investigation into the way this pathway integrates with additional pathways regulating axonal growth will further our knowledge of normal central nervous system development and pathological conditions.<sep>Abstract Motivation Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which include long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), have been shown to play essential roles in various biological processes. Over the past few years, a group of sncRNA identification tools have been developed but none has shown the capacity to fully profile and accurately identify those that are differentially expressed in control vs treated samples. Therefore, a tool that fully profiles and identifies differentially expressed sncRNAs in group comparisons is required. Results We developed sncRNAP, a Nextflow pipeline for the profiling and identification of differentially abundant sncRNAs from sRNAseq datasets. sncRNAP primary use case is the comparison of multiple small RNA-seq datasets belonging to two conditions such as the comparison of treatment (T) and control (C) cohorts. sncRNAP can be used to analyze human, mouse, and rat datasets. The pipeline carries out all the steps required to assess raw sequencing data, performs differential gene expression (DE) analysis, profiles sncRNAs in each sample, and outputs TXT, PDF, CSV, and interactive HTML files for the quality score and the top identified sncRNA candidates. We verified sncRNAP on publicly available sRNAseq datasets in chronic hepatitis-infected liver tissue and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) datasets. Our results support the identification of Val[C/A]AC in hepatitis patients and miR135b in PDAC as potential disease biomarkers. Furthermore, we applied sncRNAP on mouse samples from control and Opa1 mouse mutants and identified AspGTC, ValAAC, SerTGA, and AspGTC as the top DE tsRNAs. In addition, sncRNAP identified mmu-miR-136-5p, mmu-miR-10b-5p, mmu-miR-351-5p, and mmu-miR-6390 as the top DE miRNA candidates.<sep>Abstract Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with progressive cognitive deficits and mood disorders (Knopman et al., 2021). Recent studies have associated AD pathology with the impairment of adult neurogenesis, as indicated by impaired neural stem cell (NSCs) homeostasis (Bond et al., 2015). Recent work has further associated AD progression with a decline in the number and maturation of adult-born neurons in the SGZ, distinct from typical age-related decline (Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019). In 3xTG-AD mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, our and other groups have demonstrated impairments to NSC pool and neural progenitor proliferation, as well as adult-born neurons, before the onset of Aβ plaques and NFTs (Hamilton et al., 2010, 2015; Rodríguez et al., 2008, 2009). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the functional impairment of adult NSCs remain to be resolved. Here, we employ single-cell RNA-Seq to establish population-specific defects in the 3xTG-AD mouse model during adult SGZ neurogenesis. Relative to control mice, we observe a dramatic AD-induced decrease in the primed and activated NSC population, which results in a progressive loss of cells committed to neurogenesis. Transcriptome measurements suggest that 3xTG-AD NSCs and their progeny represent enhanced ribosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis, and disturbed Notch signaling pathway. RNA velocity analysis reveals reduced NSC activation as evidenced by a large fraction of Ascl1-postive cells, instead of entering cell cycle, returning to the primed and quiescent state. This is further supported by reduced numbers of Lpar1-expressing cells, a marker of neural progenitor cells, in the SGZ. Our work explores, at a stage-specific resolution, changes in the regulatory networks guiding adult neurogenesis, and identifies niche disturbances in the regulation of NSC quiescence and activation. These NSC deficits underlying impaired neurogenesis identified in AD mice, may be key contributors underlying the compromised hippocampal function in AD.<sep>Loss of function mutations in the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1) gene have been linked with an autosomal recessive familial form of early onset Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for degeneration remains elusive. Presently, using co-immunoprecipitation in HEK (Human embryonic kidney) 293 cells, we show that Pink1 endogenously interacts with FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51 or FKBP5), FKBP5 and directly phosphorylates FKBP5 at Serine in an in vitro kinase assay. Both FKBP5 and Pink1 have been previously associated with protein kinase B (AKT) regulation. We provide evidence using primary cortical cultured neurons from Pink1-deficient mice that Pink1 increases AKT phosphorylation at Serine 473 (Ser473) challenged by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+ ) and that over-expression of FKBP5 using an adeno-associated virus delivery system negatively regulates AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in murine-cultured cortical neurons. Interestingly, FKBP5 over-expression promotes death in response to MPP+ in the absence of Pink1. Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of FKBP5 in cultured cortical neurons is protective and this effect is reversed with inhibition of AKT signaling. In addition, shRNA down-regulation of PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) in Pink1 WT neurons increases neuronal survival, while down-regulation of PHLPP in Pink1 KO rescues neuronal death in response to MPP+ . Finally, using co-immunoprecipitation, we show that FKBP5 interacts with the kinase AKT and phosphatase PHLPP. This interaction is increased in the absence of Pink1, both in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF) and in mouse brain tissue. Expression of kinase dead Pink1 (K219M) enhances FKBP5 interaction with both AKT and PHLPP. Overall, our results suggest a testable model by which Pink1 could regulate AKT through phosphorylation of FKBP5 and interaction of AKT with PHLPP. Our results suggest a potential mechanism by which PINK1-FKBP5 pathway contributes to neuronal death in PD.

However, how this signaling pathway induces cell death is unclear. Previously, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 pathway activates the pro-apoptotic transcriptional co-regulator Cited2 in vitro after DNA damage. In the present study, we report that Cited2 protein expression is also dramatically increased following stroke/ischemic insult. Critically, utilizing conditional knockout mice, we show that Cited2 is required for neuronal cell death, both in culture and in mice after ischemic insult. Importantly, determining the mechanism by which Cited2 levels are regulated, we found that E2F transcription factor (E2F) family members participate in Cited2 regulation. First, E2F1 expression induced Cited2 transcription, and E2F1 deficiency reduced Cited2 expression. Moreover, determining the potential E2F-binding regions on the Cited2 gene regulatory sequence by ChIP analysis, we provide evidence that E2F1/4 proteins bind to this DNA region. A luciferase reporter assay to probe the functional outcomes of this interaction revealed that E2F1 activates and E2F4 inhibits Cited2 transcription. Moreover, we identified the functional binding motif for E2F1 in the Cited2 gene promoter by demonstrating that mutation of this site dramatically reduces E2F1-mediated Cited2 transcription. Finally, E2F1 and E2F4 regulated Cited2 expression in neurons after stroke-related insults. Taken together, these results indicate that the E2F–Cited2 regulatory pathway is critically involved in stroke injury.

Some algae have gone a step beyond photosynthesis and can use light to initiate enzymatic photodecarboxylation of fatty acids, producing long-chain hydrocarbons. To understand this transformation, Sorigué et al. brought to bear an array of structural, computational, and spectroscopic techniques and fully characterized the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. These experiments are consistent with a mechanism starting with electron transfer from the fatty acid to a photoexcited oxidized flavin cofactor. Decarboxylation yields an alkyl radical, which is then reduced by back electron transfer and protonation rather than hydrogen atom transfer. The wealth of experimental data explains how algae harness light energy to produce alka(e)nes and provides an appealing model system for understanding enzyme-catalyzed photochemistry more generally. Science , this issue p. eabd5687<sep>Abstract Use of microbes to produce liquid transportation fuels is not yet economically viable. A key point to reduce production costs is the design a cell factory that combines the continuous production of drop-in fuel molecules with the ability to recover products from the cell culture at low cost. Medium-chain hydrocarbons seem ideal targets because they can be produced from abundant fatty acids and, due to their volatility, can be easily collected in gas phase. However, pathways used to produce hydrocarbons from fatty acids require two steps, low efficient enzymes and/or complex electron donors. Recently, a new hydrocarbon-forming route involving a single enzyme called fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) was discovered in microalgae. Here, we show that in illuminated E. coli cultures coexpression of FAP and a medium-chain fatty acid thioesterase results in continuous release of volatile hydrocarbons. Maximum hydrocarbon productivity was reached under low/medium light while higher irradiance resulted in decreased amounts of FAP. It was also found that the production rate of hydrocarbons was constant for at least 5 days and that 30% of total hydrocarbons could be collected in the gas phase of the culture. This work thus demonstrates that the photochemistry of the FAP can be harnessed to design a simple cell factory that continuously produces hydrocarbons easy to recover and in pure form.<sep>Epithemia spp. diatoms contain obligate, nitrogen-fixing endosymbionts, or \"diazoplasts\", derived from cyanobacteria. These algae are a rare example of photosynthetic eukaryotes that have successfully coupled oxygenic photosynthesis with oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase activity. Here, we report a newly-isolated species, E. clementina, as a model to investigate endosymbiotic acquisition of nitrogen fixation. To detect the metabolic changes associated with endosymbiotic specialization, we compared nitrogen fixation, associated carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and their regulatory pathways in the Epithemia diazoplast with its close, free-living cyanobacterial relative, Crocosphaera subtropica. Unlike C. subtropica, we show that nitrogenase activity in the diazoplast is concurrent with, and even dependent on, host photosynthesis and no longer associated with cyanobacterial glycogen storage suggesting carbohydrates are imported from the host diatom. Carbohydrate catabolism in the diazoplast indicates that the oxidative pentose pathway and oxidative phosphorylation, in concert, generates reducing equivalents and ATP and consumes oxygen to support nitrogenase activity. In contrast to expanded nitrogenase activity, the diazoplast has diminished ability to utilize alternative nitrogen sources. Upon ammonium repletion, negative feedback regulation of nitrogen fixation was conserved, however ammonia assimilation showed paradoxical responses in the diazoplast compared with C. subtropica. The altered nitrogen regulation likely favors nitrogen transfer to the host. Our results suggest that the diazoplast is specialized for endosymbiotic nitrogen fixation. Altogether, we establish a new model for studying endosymbiosis, perform the first functional characterization of this diazotroph endosymbiosis, and identify metabolic adaptations for endosymbiotic acquisition of a critical biological function.<sep>Abstract Fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) is one of the few enzymes that require light for their catalytic cycle (photoenzymes). FAP was first identified in the microalga Chlorella variabilis NC64A, and belongs to an algae-specific subgroup of the glucose–methanol–choline oxidoreductase family. While the FAP from C. variabilis and its Chlamydomonas reinhardtii homolog CrFAP have demonstrated in vitro activities, their activities and physiological functions have not been studied in vivo. Furthermore, the conservation of FAP activity beyond green microalgae remains hypothetical. Here, using a C. reinhardtii FAP knockout line (fap), we showed that CrFAP is responsible for the formation of 7-heptadecene, the only hydrocarbon of this alga. We further showed that CrFAP was predominantly membrane-associated and that &amp;gt;90% of 7-heptadecene was recovered in the thylakoid fraction. In the fap mutant, photosynthetic activity was not affected under standard growth conditions, but was reduced after cold acclimation when light intensity varied. A phylogenetic analysis that included sequences from Tara Ocean identified almost 200 putative FAPs and indicated that FAP was acquired early after primary endosymbiosis. Within Bikonta, FAP was retained in secondary photosynthetic endosymbiosis lineages but absent from those that lost the plastid. Characterization of recombinant FAPs from various algal genera (Nannochloropsis, Ectocarpus, Galdieria, Chondrus) provided experimental evidence that FAP photochemical activity was present in red and brown algae, and was not limited to unicellular species. These results thus indicate that FAP was conserved during the evolution of most algal lineages where photosynthesis was retained, and suggest that its function is linked to photosynthetic membranes.<sep>ABSTRACT Fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) is one of the three enzymes that require light for their catalytic cycle (photoenzymes).

Tetrahydronaphthyridine 5 was rapidly identified as a highly potent MTH1 inhibitor (IC50 = 0.043 nM). Cocrystallization of 5 with MTH1 revealed the ligand in a Φ-cis-N-(pyridin-2-yl)acetamide conformation enabling a key intramolecular hydrogen bond and polar interactions with residues Gly34 and Asp120.

Modification of literature compound TH287 with O- and N-linked aryl and alkyl aryl substituents led to the discovery of potent pyrimidine-2,4,6-triamine 25 (IC50 = 0.49 nM). Triazolopyridine 32 emerged as a highly selective lead compound with a suitable in vitro profile and desirable pharmacokinetic properties in rat. Elucidation of the DNA damage response, cell viability, and intracellular concentrations of oxo-NTPs (oxidized nucleoside triphosphates) as a function of MTH1 knockdown and/or small molecule inhibition was studied. Based on our findings, we were unable to provide evidence to further pursue MTH1 as an oncology target.<sep>Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been historically challenging due the high viral genetic complexity wherein there are eight distinct genotypes and at least 86 viral subtypes. While HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors are an established treatment option for genotype 1 infection, limited coverage of genotypes 2 and/or 3 combined with serum alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations for some compounds has limited the broad utility of this therapeutic class. Our discovery efforts were focused on identifying an NS3/4A protease inhibitor with pan-genotypic antiviral activity, improved coverage of resistance associated substitutions, and a decreased risk of hepatotoxicity. Towards this goal, distinct interactions with the conserved catalytic triad of the NS3/4A protease were identified that improved genotype 3 antiviral activity. We further discovered that protein adduct formation strongly correlated with clinical ALT elevation for this therapeutic class. Improving metabolic stability and decreasing protein adduct formation through structural modifications ultimately resulted in voxilaprevir. Voxilaprevir, in combination with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, has demonstrated pan-genotypic antiviral clinical activity. Furthermore, hepatotoxicity was not observed in Phase 3 clinical trials with voxilaprevir, consistent with our design strategy. Vosevi® (sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir) is now an approved pan-genotypic treatment option for the most difficult-to-cure individuals who have previously failed direct acting antiviral therapy.<sep>Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway and a clinically validated target for small molecule inhibitors such as ibrutinib in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Tirabrutinib (GS-4059/ONO-4059) is a selective, once daily, oral BTK inhibitor with clinical activity against many relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Covalent binding of tirabrutinib to BTK Cys-481 was assessed by LC-MSMS analysis of BTK using compound as a variable modification search parameter. Inhibition potency of tirabrutinib, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and spebrutinib against BTK and related kinases was studied in a dose-dependent manner either after a fixed incubation time (as used in conventional IC50 studies) or following a time course where inactivation kinetics were measured. Tirabrutinib irreversibly and covalently binds to BTK Cys-481. The inactivation efficiency kinact/Ki was measured and used to calculate selectivity among different kinases for each of the four inhibitors studied. Tirabrutinib showed a kinact/Ki value of 2.4 ± 0.6 × 104 M−1 s−1 for BTK with selectivity against important off-targets. For the BTK inhibitors tested in this study, analysis of the inactivation kinetics yielded a more accurate measurement of potency and selectivity than conventional single-time point inhibition measurements. Subtle but clear differences were identified between clinically tested BTK inhibitors which may translate into differentiated clinical efficacy and safety. This is the first study that offers a detailed side-by-side comparison of four clinically-relevant BTK inhibitors with respect to their inactivation of BTK and related kinases.<sep>Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase that transmits calcium signals in various cellular processes. CaMKII is activated by calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) through a direct binding mechanism involving a regulatory C-terminal α-helix in CaMKII. The Ca2+/CaM binding triggers transphosphorylation of critical threonine residues proximal to the CaM-binding site leading to the autoactivated state of CaMKII. The demonstration of its critical roles in pathophysiological processes has elevated CaMKII to a key target in the management of numerous diseases. The molecule KN-93 is the most widely used inhibitor for studying the cellular and in vivo functions of CaMKII. It is widely believed that KN-93 binds directly to CaMKII, thus preventing kinase activation by competing with Ca2+/CaM. Herein, we employed surface plasmon resonance, NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize this presumed interaction. Our results revealed that KN-93 binds directly to Ca2+/CaM and not to CaMKII. This binding would disrupt the ability of Ca2+/CaM to interact with CaMKII, effectively inhibiting CaMKII activation. Our findings also indicated that KN-93 can specifically compete with a CaMKIIδ-derived peptide for binding to Ca2+/CaM. As indicated by the surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry data, apparently at least two KN-93 molecules can bind to Ca2+/CaM. Our findings provide new insight into how in vitro and in vivo data obtained with KN-93 should be interpreted. They further suggest that other Ca2+/CaM-dependent, non-CaMKII activities should be considered in KN-93–based mechanism-of-action studies and drug discovery efforts.<sep>ABSTRACT Protease inhibitors (PIs) remain an important component of antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection due to their high genetic barrier to resistance development. Nevertheless, the two most commonly prescribed HIV PIs, atazanavir and darunavir, still require co-administration with a pharmacokinetic boosting agent to maintain sufficient drug plasma levels which can lead to undesirable drug-drug interactions. Herein, we describe GS-9770, a novel investigational non-peptidomimetic HIV PI with unboosted once-daily oral dosing potential due to improvements in its metabolic stability and its pharmacokinetic properties in preclinical animal species. This compound demonstrates potent inhibitory activity and high on-target selectivity for recombinant HIV-1 protease versus other aspartic proteases tested. In cell culture, GS-9770 inhibits Gag polyprotein cleavage and shows nanomolar anti-HIV-1 potency in primary human cells permissive to HIV-1 infection and against a broad range of HIV subtypes. GS-9770 demonstrates an improved resistance profile against a panel of patient-derived HIV-1 isolates with resistance to atazanavir and darunavir. In resistance selection experiments, GS-9770 prevented the emergence of breakthrough HIV-1 variants at all fixed drug concentrations tested and required multiple protease substitutions to enable outgrowth of virus exposed to escalating concentrations of GS-9770. This compound also remained fully active against viruses resistant to drugs from other antiviral classes and showed no in vitro antagonism when combined pairwise with drugs from other antiretroviral classes. Collectively, these preclinical data identify GS-9770 as a potent, non-peptidomimetic once-daily oral HIV PI with potential to overcome the persistent requirement for pharmacological boosting with this class of antiretroviral agents.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/505742", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5064616969", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5059119556", "response": "Comparison: Candidate B demonstrates a stronger alignment with the job description, particularly in the areas of clinical translational research, drug development, and biomarker application, as evidenced by their extensive work on antiviral agents, drug discovery, and enzyme inhibition, which are directly relevant to the responsibilities of the DRBD Directorship.

Our model predicts that social capital, by enabling information-sharing and coordination among community members, decreases carcinogenic releases. Our analysis, based on the US county-level releases derived from around 2 million chemical-facility-level reports during the period 1998–2019 and the instrumental variables approach, confirms our prediction. However, the impact is reduced when counties rely on waste-releasing firms for economic opportunities. An important policy implication of our study is that the efficacy of initiatives to alleviate environmental injustice is likely to depend on communities’ social capital.<sep>While firms regularly reduce workforce following sharp performance decline, diversified firms may abstain from employment downsizing by transferring capital and labor between segments (the allocative flexibility effect). However, downsizing may be more likely if a performance shock leads to efforts to reduce inefficiency in resource allocation (the inefficient internal market effect). Using a large cross-country dataset, our results provide strong support for the inefficient internal market effect. We find that diversified firms are more likely to downsize and the national employment protection and union power laws moderate this link. We also find that diversified firms with more excess employment are more likely to downsize and that downsizing following major adverse performance shocks is associated with lower level of diversification and excess employment.<sep>Delays in contractor selection are widespread and often costly in public procurement. This paper is the first thorough empirical examination of a common view held by practitioners and in the theoretical literature that negotiation as a selection process causes delay. We adapt an established framework of decision-making process in the wider organisation literature to identify the determinants of decision speed in public procurement. Employing data for all UK public procurement contracts during 2009-2015, our results using both logit models and duration analysis suggest that organisational factors (e.g. the centralisation of procurement) and contract features (e.g. contract complexity) account better for delay. We also find that the choice of simpler procurement procedures, whether these involve negotiation or not, can reduce the decision time. Such time efficiency further justifies the use of negotiation for complex contracts, where this procedure has been proved cost-efficient.<sep>What factors do private investors consider relevant in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)? Are these features of country attractiveness sector speciﬁc? In line with increasing demands for infrastructure investments for economic growth and development in recent years, coupled with a huge, yet uneven, global infrastructure gap, this study provides a critical and timely investigation into these topical issues. We study 101 countries, across six regions, and consider country attractiveness under four channels: Macroeconomic and Market; Fiscal Constraints; Regulatory and Governance; Experience in PPPs, and also, across four sectors: Telecommunications; Energy; Transportation; Water & Sewerage. We ﬁnd and highlight signiﬁcant idiosyncratic features that exist across the sectors considered. Corruption does not appear to be a signiﬁcant consideration in the PPP investment decision and we also show that the Macroeconomic and Market Channel is crucial. Our ﬁndings, and subsequent policy recommendations, are relevant for countries aiming to attract PPP investments for infrastructure development, particularly developing countries.<sep>Social and economic infrastructure are essential for economic development. However, over the last three decades, many infrastructure projects in developing countries have failed. These failures raise the question as to the role of governments in the provision, and longevity, of much needed infrastructure. In this paper, we seek to examine the significance of governments’ residual ownership in determining the failure of infrastructure projects that started as Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). We utilise duration analysis to analyse 2721 PPP projects across six regions globally and find that assigning the residual ownership of infrastructure projects to the government reduces the probability of project failure. It may be the case that assigning the risk of residual ownership to governments makes the project more affordable to end users. We also find that both project size and sector play an important role in determining the probability of project failure. These findings provide policy insights and highlights issues around the way infrastructure projects in developing countries are negotiated between the private sector and governments.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Staffing<sep>Health services research<sep>Thematic analysis<sep>Public health<sep>Informed consent<sep>Alternative medicine<sep>Legislation<sep>Critically ill<sep>Stakeholder<sep>Qualitative research</keyword><title>Guidance to inform research recruitment processes for studies involving critically ill patients<sep>Learning from stakeholders to inform good practice guidance on consent to research in intensive care units: a mixed-methods study<sep>Strategies to enhance recruitment and consent to intensive care studies: a qualitative study with researchers and patient–public involvement contributors</title><abstract>Clinical research in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for improving treatments for critically ill patients. However, invitations to participate in clinical research in this situation pose numerous challenges. Studies are frequently initiated within a narrow time window when patients are often unconscious and unable to consent. Consultations or consent discussions must therefore be held with consultees or representatives, usually the patient’s relatives. Conversations about research participation in this setting may be difficult, as relatives are often overwhelmed and may feel uneasy about making decisions on behalf of their relatives. In some circumstances, legislation allows doctors to act as consultees or representatives to enrol patients in research. However, there is little good quality evidence on UK stakeholders’ perspectives to inform how recruitment is carried out in ICU studies. The Perspectives Study collected evidence on the views of over 1400 stakeholders, including patients, relatives and healthcare practitioners, many of whom had first-hand experience of ICU treatment and research. This evidence was used to inform good practice guidance on recruitment of critically ill patients to research. Established social science methods and empirical ethics were employed to reflect the interests of stakeholders and justify recommendations. This guidance aims to bridge the gap between the legal frameworks and the realities of ICU studies and to ensure that research recruitment processes reflect the views of patients and families. Researchers and an expert Advisory Group brought different perspectives to interpreting the evidence to develop the guidance. In this article we present guidance for future ICU studies.<sep>Obtaining informed consent from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) prior to enrolment in a study is practically and ethically complex. Decisions about the participation of critically ill patients in research often involve substitute decision makers (SDMs), such as a patient's relatives or doctors. We explored the perspectives of different stakeholder groups towards these consent procedures.Mixed-methods study comprising surveys completed by ICU patients, their relatives and healthcare practitioners in 14 English ICUs, followed by qualitative interviews with a subset of survey participants. Empirical bioethics informed the analysis and synthesis of the data. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics of Likert responses, and analysis of interview data was informed by thematic reflective approaches.Analysis included 1409 survey responses (ICU patients n=333, relatives n=488, healthcare practitioners n=588) and 60 interviews (ICU patients n=13, relatives n=30, healthcare practitioners n=17). Most agreed with relatives acting as SDMs based on the perception that relatives often know the patient well enough to reflect their views. While the practice of doctors serving as SDMs was supported by most survey respondents, a quarter (25%) disagreed. Views were more positive at interview and shifted markedly depending on particularities of the study. Participants also wanted reassurance that patient care was prioritised over research recruitment. Findings lend support for adaptations to consent procedures, including collaborative decision-making to correct misunderstandings of the implications of research for that patient. This empirical evidence is used to develop good practice guidance that is to be published separately.Participants largely supported existing consent procedures, but their perspectives on these consent procedures depended on their perceptions of what the research involved and the safeguards in place. Findings point to the importance of explaining clearly what safeguards are in place to protect the patient.<sep>Objective Clinical trials and studies in intensive care units (ICUs) have complex consent processes and often encounter problems in recruiting patients. By interviewing research team members about the challenges in critical care research, we aimed to identify strategies to enhance recruitment and consent to ICU studies. Methods Semistructured interviews with UK-based researchers (N=17) and patient–public involvement (PPI) contributors (N=8) with experience of ICU studies. Analysis of transcripts of audio-recorded interviews drew on thematic approaches. Results Seven themes were identified. Participants emphasised the need for substitute decision-making processes in critical care studies, yet some researchers reported that research ethics committees (RECs) were reluctant to approve such processes. Researchers spoke about the potential benefits of research without prior consent (RWPC) for studies with narrow recruitment windows but believed RECs would not approve them. Participants indicated that the activity of PPI contributors was limited in critical care studies, though researchers who had involved PPI contributors more extensively were clear that their input when designing consent processes was important. Researchers and PPI contributors pointed to resource and staffing limitations as barriers to patient recruitment. Researchers varied in whether and how they used professional consultees as substitute decision-makers, in whether they approached families by telephone to discuss research and in whether they disclosed details of research participation to bereaved relatives. Conclusion Critical care research could benefit from RECs having expertise in consent processes that are suited to this setting, better staffing at research sites, more extensive PPI and an evidence base on stakeholder perspectives on critical care research processes. Guidance on professional consultee processes, telephoning relatives to discuss research, RWPC and disclosure of research participation to bereaved relatives could help to harmonise practice in these areas and enhance recruitment and consent to critical care studies.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/53138/professor-of-information-management/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5059937266", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5026608250", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the Information Management (IM) discipline through their research on public-private partnerships, procurement, and environmental justice, which are relevant to IM's focus on managing information and resources efficiently.

The functional behaviors of these systems depend on the interactions of the chromophores' vibronic states, as well as interactions with their environment. To optimize their functions, it is necessary to characterize the chromophore network's structural and energetic properties, including the electronic delocalization in some cases.

Existing models for erythropoiesis do not include a central role for the ubiquitous iron storage protein ferritin; one model proposes that incoming endosomal Fe3+ bound to transferrin enters the cytoplasm through an ion transporter after reduction to Fe2+ and is taken up into mitochondria through mitoferrin-1 transporter. Here, we apply a dual three-dimensional imaging and spectroscopic technique, based on scanned electron probes, to measure Fe3+ in ex vivo human hematopoietic stem cells.

Existing models for erythropoiesis do not involve a central role for the ubiquitous iron storage protein ferritin, but instead indicate that incoming endosomal Fe3+ attached to transferrin enters the cytoplasm through divalent metal ion transporters after reduction to Fe2+, and is immediately taken up into mitochondria through the mitoferrin-1 transporter.

The RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is present in several MLOs, undergoes LLPS, and has been linked to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While some ALS-associated mutations in TDP-43 disrupt self-interaction and function, here we show that designed single mutations can enhance TDP-43 assembly and function via modulating helical structure. Using molecular simulation and NMR spectroscopy, we observe large structural changes upon dimerization of TDP-43. Two conserved glycine residues (G335 and G338) are potent inhibitors of helical extension and helix-helix interaction, which are removed in part by variants at these positions, including the ALS-associated G335D. Substitution to helix-enhancing alanine at either of these positions dramatically enhances<sep>Recent advances in residue-level coarse-grained (CG) computational models have enabled molecular-level insights into biological condensates of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), shedding light on the sequence determinants of their phase separation. The existing CG models that treat protein chains as flexible molecules connected via harmonic bonds cannot populate common secondary-structure elements. Here, we present a CG dihedral angle potential between four neighboring beads centered at Cα atoms to faithfully capture the transient helical structures of IDPs. In order to parameterize and validate our new model, we propose Cα-based helix assignment rules based on dihedral angles that succeed in reproducing the atomistic helicity results of a polyalanine peptide and folded proteins. We then introduce sequence-dependent dihedral angle potential parameters (εd) and use experimentally available helical<sep>We present improvements to the hydropathy scale (HPS) coarse-grained (CG) model for simulating sequence-specific behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), including their liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The previous model based on an atomistic hydropathy scale by Kapcha and Rossky (KR scale) is not able to capture some well-known LLPS trends such as reduced phase separation propensity upon mutations (R-to-K and Y-to-F). Here, we propose to use the Urry hydropathy scale instead, which was derived from the inverse temperature transitions in a model polypeptide with guest residues X. We introduce two free parameters to shift (Δ) and scale (µ) the overall interaction strengths for the new model (HPS-Urry) and use the experimental radius of gyration for a diverse group of IDPs to find their<sep>The liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is a commonly observed phenomenon within the cell, and such condensates are also highly attractive for applications in biomaterials and drug delivery. A better understanding of the sequence-dependent thermoresponsive behavior is of immense interest as it will aid in the design of protein sequences with desirable properties and in the understanding of cellular response to heat stress. In this work, we use a transferable coarse-grained model to directly probe the sequence-dependent thermoresponsive phase behavior of IDPs. To achieve this goal, we develop a unique knowledge-based amino acid potential that accounts for the temperature-dependent effects on solvent-mediated interactions for different types of amino acids.

It has been proposed that HP1α functions through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which allows it to compact chromatin into transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin regions. In vitro, HP1α can undergo phase separation upon phosphorylation of its N-terminus extension (NTE) and/or through interactions with DNA and chromatin. Here, we combine computational and experimental approaches to elucidate the molecular interactions that drive these processes. In phosphorylation-driven LLPS, HP1α can exchange intradimer hinge-NTE interactions with interdimer contacts, which also leads to a structural change from a compacted to an extended HP1α dimer conformation. This process can be enhanced by the presence of positively charged HP1α peptide ligands and disrupted by the addition of negatively charged or neutral<sep>DNA nanostructures can perform as scaffolds to organize dye molecules into networks for a variety of applications. Such networks rely on having efficient energy-and/or electron-transport processes, and these in turn depend sensitively on the relative distance and orientation of the dye molecules. In using DNA as a scaffold, a crucial question is - to what extent can it control the dye position and orientation? The ability of DNA nanostructures to dictate the position is reasonably well addressed in the literature, but much less is known about the potential for controlling the orientation and its dependences on the local microenvironment of the DNA and on the dye attachment chemistry. Furthermore, can sites within a DNA nanostructure be used to place dyes in close proximity<sep>Abstract Much is known about the finely regulated process of mammalian erythropoiesis that occurs in the bone marrow, whereby erythropoietic stem cells undergo terminal differentiation accompanied by enormous morphological changes to generate highly functional specialized red blood cells. However, a crucial step in erythropoiesis, the labile iron pool and its transport to mitochondria for heme production, is not well understood 1 . We apply a dual 3D imaging and spectroscopic technique, based on scanned electron probes, to measure distributions of ferritin iron-storage protein in ex vivo human erythropoietic stem cells, and to determine how those distributions change during terminal differentiation. After seven days of differentiation, the cells display a highly specialized architecture of organelles with anchored clustering of mitochondria and massive accumulation of<sep>The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family is a crucial component of heterochromatin with diverse functions in gene regulation, cell cycle control, and cell differentiation. In humans, there are three paralogs, HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ, which exhibit remarkable similarities in their domain architecture and sequence properties. Nevertheless, these paralogs display distinct behaviors in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process linked to heterochromatin formation. Here, we employ a coarse-grained simulation framework to uncover the sequence features responsible for the observed differences in LLPS. We highlight the significance of the net charge and charge patterning along the sequence in governing paralog LLPS propensities. We also show that both highly conserved folded and less-conserved disordered domains contribute to the observed differences. Furthermore, we explore the potential co-localization<sep>Abstract DNA scaffolds provide a means to precisely organize chromophores into large biomimetic exciton networks and direct energy transport for nanoscale sensing and light‐harvesting applications. Here, a functional building block of minimal complexity that maximizes the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency is sought. Using a model system consisting of three FRET steps in a 4‐dye cascade: Cy3→Cy3.5→Cy5→Cy5.5, we evaluate how this building block employs multiple interacting versus redundant FRET pathways. Variants of a dual rail design, where one or two copies of each dye are aligned in rigid linear parallel rows, are compared to a split rail format, where varying degrees of spacing are introduced between the rows. The FRET processes are assessed via steady‐state, time‐resolved, and single‐molecule spectroscopy. Experiments and simulation<sep>Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless organelles (MLOs), which majorly consist of RNA and RNA-binding proteins and are formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Experimental studies investigating the drivers of LLPS have shown that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and nucleic acids like RNA and other polynucleotides play a key role in modulating protein phase separation. There is currently a dearth of modelling techniques which allow one to delve deeper into how polynucleotides play the role of a modulator/promoter of LLPS in cells using computational methods. Here, we present a coarse-grained polynucleotide model developed to fill this gap, which together with our recently developed HPS model for protein LLPS, allows us to capture the factors driving protein-polynucleotide phase separation.

DNA scaffolding has been shown to be effective at promoting the aggregation of dyes in a controllable manner. Specifically, isolated DNA Holliday junctions have been used to achieve strongly coupled cyanine dye dimers. However, the structural properties of the dimers and the DNA, as well as the role of Holliday junction isomerization are not fully understood. To study the dynamics of cyanine dimers in DNA, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for adjacent and transverse dimers attached to Holliday junctions in two different isomers. It was found that dyes attached to adjacent strands in the junction exhibit stronger dye-DNA interactions and larger<sep>The stability and physiological function of many biomolecular coacervates depend on the structure and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that typically contain a significant fraction of charged residues. Although the effect of relative arrangement of charged residues on IDP conformation is a well-studied problem, the associated changes in dynamics are far less understood. In this work, we systematically interrogate the effects of charge distribution on the chain-level and segmental dynamics of polyampholytic IDPs in dilute solutions. We study a coarse-grained model polyampholyte consisting of an equal fraction of two oppositely charged residues (glutamic acid and lysine) that undergoes a transition from an ideal chainlike conformation for uniformly charge-patterned sequences to a semicompact conformation for highly charge-segregated sequences. Changes in the chain-level dynamics<sep>Understanding the conformational ensemble of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) is of great interest due to its relevance to critical intracellular functions and diseases. It is now well established that the polymer scaling behavior can provide a great deal of information about the conformational properties as well as liquid–liquid phase separation of an IDP. It is, therefore, extremely desirable to be able to predict an IDP’s scaling behavior from the protein sequence itself. The work in this direction so far has focused on highly charged proteins and how charge patterning can perturb their structural properties.

DNA origami templates are harnessed to accurately position single molecules; however, direct single molecule evidence is lacking regarding how well DNA origami can control the orientation of such molecules in three-dimensional space, as well as the factors affecting control. Here, we present two strategies for controlling the polar (θ) and in-plane azimuthal (ϕ) angular orientations of cyanine Cy5 single molecules tethered on rationally-designed DNA origami templates that are physically adsorbed (physisorbed) on glass substrates. By using dipolar imaging to evaluate Cy5's orientation and super-resolution microscopy, the absolute spatial orientation of Cy5 is calculated relative to the DNA template.

Numerous studies indicate TDP‐43 can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro and is a component of biological condensates. Homo‐oligomerization via the folded N‐terminal domain (aa:1–77) and the conserved helical region (aa:319–341) of the disordered, C‐terminal domain is found to be an important driver of TDP‐43 phase separation. However, a comprehensive molecular view of TDP‐43 phase separation, particularly regarding the nature of heterodomain interactions, is lacking due to the challenges associated with its stability and purification. Here, we utilize all‐atom and coarse‐grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to<sep>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can form biomolecular condensates through phase separation. It is recognized that the conformation of IDPs in the dense and dilute phases as well as at the interfaces of condensates can critically impact the resulting properties associated with their functionality. However, a comprehensive understanding of the conformational transitions of IDPs during condensation remains elusive. In this study, we employ a coarse-grained polyampholyte model, comprising an equal number of oppositely charged residues-glutamic acid and lysine-whereby conformations and phase behavior can be readily tuned by altering the protein sequence. By manipulating the sequence patterns from perfectly alternating to block-like, we obtain chains with ideal-like conformations to semi-compact structures in the dilute phase, while in the dense phase, the chain conformation is approximately<sep>Biomolecules undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), resulting in the formation of multicomponent protein-RNA membraneless organelles in cells. However, the physiological and pathological role of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the biophysics of phase behavior is only beginning to be probed. To study the effect of PTMs on LLPS in silico, we extend our transferable coarse-grained model of intrinsically disordered proteins to include phosphorylated and acetylated amino acids. Using the parameters for modified amino acids available for fixed-charge atomistic force fields, we parameterize the size and atomistic hydropathy of the coarse-grained-modified amino acid beads and, hence, the interactions between the modified and natural amino acids. We then elucidate how the number and position of phosphorylated and acetylated residues alter the protein’s single-chain compactness and its<sep>Interaction strength and localization are critical parameters controlling the single-chain and condensed-state properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).

Dyes with large transition dipole moments (μ) are necessary to optimize coupling within dye aggregates. Extinction coefficients (ε) can be used to determine the μ of dyes, and so dyes with a large ε (>150,000 M−1cm−1) should be engineered or identified. However, dye properties leading to a large ε are not fully understood, and low-throughput methods of dye screening, such as experimental measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can be time-consuming. In order to screen large datasets of molecules for desirable properties (i.e., large ε and μ), a computational workflow was established using machine learning (ML), DFT, time-dependent (TD-) DFT, and molecular dynamics (MD). ML<sep>Abstract Material properties of phase-separated biomolecular assemblies, enriched with disordered proteins, dictate their ability to participate in many cellular functions. Despite the significant effort dedicated to understanding how the sequence of the disordered protein drives its phase separation to form condensates, little is known about the sequence determinants of condensate material properties. Here, we computationally decipher these relationships for charged disordered proteins using model sequences comprised of glutamic acid and lysine residues as well as naturally occurring sequences of LAF1’s RGG domain and DDX4’s N-terminal domain. We do so by delineating how the arrangement of oppositely charged residues within these sequences influences the dynamical, rheological, and interfacial properties of the condensed phase through equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular simulations using the hydropathy scale and<sep>The formation of membraneless organelles in cells commonly occurs via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and is in many cases driven by multivalent interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Investigating the nature of these interactions, and their effect on dynamics within the condensed phase, is therefore of critical importance but very challenging for either simulation or experiment. Here, we study these interactions and their dynamics by pairing a novel multiscale simulation strategy with microsecond all-atom MD simulations of a condensed, IDP-rich phase. We simulate two IDPs this way, the low complexity domain of FUS and the N-terminal disordered domain of LAF-1, and find good agreement with experimental information about average density, water content, and residue-residue contacts. We go significantly beyond what is known from<sep>Summary The Polycomb Group (PcG) complex PRC1 represses transcription, forms condensates in cells, and modifies chromatin architecture. These processes are connected through the essential, polymerizing Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) present in the PRC1 subunit Polyhomeotic (Ph). In vitro , Ph SAM drives formation of short oligomers and phase separation with DNA or chromatin in the context of a Ph truncation (“mini-Ph”). Oligomer length is controlled by the long disordered linker (L) that connects the SAM to the rest of Ph--replacing Drosophila PhL with the evolutionarily diverged human PHC3L strongly increases oligomerization. How the linker controls SAM polymerization, and how polymerization and the linker affect condensate formation are not know. We analyzed PhL and PHC3L using biochemical assays and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

However, most existing CG DNA models are not compatible with CG protein models, limiting their applications for emerging topics such as protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Here, we present a new computationally efficient CG DNA model. We first use experimental data to establish the model’s ability to predict various aspects of DNA behavior, including melting thermodynamics and relevant local structural properties such as the major and minor grooves. We then employ an all-atom hydropathy scale to define non-bonded interactions between protein and DNA sites, to make our DNA model compatible with an existing CG protein model (HPS-Urry), that is extensively used</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/600022", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5015267590", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5030859062", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in physical chemistry, plasma physics, and advanced optical techniques, which aligns well with the innovative and research-driven mission of the Department of Biological Chemistry.

Major theoretical approaches to urban development, such as place-based leadership or coproduction, emphasize the importance of the public sector. This study aims to enhance the understanding of urban development processes as a collaborative and participatory concept through social innovation. We apply the concept of socially creative milieus to analyze the emergence of social innovation under the constraint of uncertainty. The criteria ‘agents of innovation’, ‘adopters’, ‘diffusion channels’, ‘constraints’, ‘inertia’, and ‘impacts’ are analyzed using a holistic case study in the field of urban development. Our results show that the presence of high social capital supersedes the coercive power of the public sector. By applying the creative milieus approach, environments like the density of networks and contacts in the governance of urban places make innovative development possible.<sep>Abstract While volunteering is an essential factor in service delivery in many societal areas, the inclusion of volunteers in formal settings can also lead to tensions. In this article, we combine the literature on volunteering and inter-professional collaboration (IPC) to elaborate a framework regarding remedies for tensions between professional staff and volunteers within IPC in health care provision to ensure successful collaboration. Using a dyadic survey design to interview volunteers and volunteer managers, we show that the perspectives of volunteers and volunteer managers on the antecedents of effective IPC differ in paradoxical ways. While volunteer managers apply organizational logic concerning tasks and processes to avoid tensions, volunteers seek solutions on a relational basis. However, rather than trying to resolve these paradoxes, our study indicates that carefully managing tensions arising between volunteers and professional staff may be more successful than trying to resolve all tensions.<sep>The COVID-19 pandemic affected the provision of voluntary work across the globe. We study informal volunteers who buy and deliver groceries for people in a high-risk group or in quarantine. Using data from a volunteering grocery delivering app in Switzerland that coordinated these volunteers, we are able to track volunteering during the pandemic. Combined with public health data on cases and deaths, we test how the severity of the pandemic affects the provision of voluntary work in the form of neighborhood grocery deliveries. We find a positive effect of the number of deaths on voluntary deliveries. However, in contrast to the literature studying the effect of the severity of the pandemic on giving, this effect is concave. We suggest that this concave effect is due to the signal of risk of infection implied by rising death rates, which is at odds with the signal of need to help others.<sep>Abstract This piece of work aims to connect the governance and leadership levels of foundations with the demand to respond to the societal poly‐crisis. Challenges such as climate change, migration, demographic development and economic debts cannot be solved on the level of a single country and, thus, call for joint action. Given the inherent independence of foundations, an analysis of how foundations can strengthen their contribution to solve the global poly‐crisis has to begin with the single organisation, its purpose and its leaders. However, how feasible is it to evolve, transform even, governance and leadership in philanthropic organisations, which are often considered rather rigid and inflexible organisations? Based on arguments on governance and leadership of foundations from both the academic and the public debate, we formulate four propositions on how foundation leaders can adapt their foundation to the current societal situation. The propositions include aspects such as transparency, empowerment, sensemaking and leadership support.<sep>In their pursuit of value creation, charitable foundations are mission- rather than profit-driven. Therefore, foundations are also mission-driven investors. We explore the effects of mission-driven portfolio selection based on three model foundations, representing common fields of activity in Switzerland. Employing a moving block bootstrap approach, we simulate time series. Based on these model foundations and under the integration of qualitative company rating data, such as environmental, social, and governance-related characteristics (ESG), we find both negative and no significant financial effects of portfolio screening. However, screening portfolios substantially increases mission-driven portfolio quality. Additionally, screening reduces reputational risks and even leptokurtic return characteristics under special consideration of governance issues. After a joint analysis of financial and qualitative factors for portfolios with equity shares of 25% and 50%, we did find strong enough evidence to encourage foundations to implement negative and positive screening criteria. Additionally, we argue that without the integration of mission-based qualitative criteria, for instance, the involvement in business activities contradicting the foundation’s mission, an adequate evaluation of investment opportunities’ desirability is not feasible.<sep>Abstract Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) have increasingly adopted business‐like practices as a response to institutional pressures. Some researchers argue that this development leads to mission drift, whereas others find a positive effect on organizational performance. However, the institutional pressures responsible for shaping the nonprofit sector have remained hard to distinguish from each other. This study explores the consequences of mimetic, normative, and coercive pressures, and looks at how they affect managerialism, organizational performance, and mission drift. We link these concepts through a structural equation model based on survey data and find that one aspect of managerialism, strategic behavior, is a key construct in influencing the response to isomorphic pressures and can positively affect organizational performance while holding off‐mission drift. Normative isomorphism even has a direct positive effect on organizational performance. Mission drift can take place when organizations are under coercive pressure without having strategies or internal processes in place. These findings imply that organizations should invest in their strategy and the professional development of their staff to increase organizational performance and avoid mission drift.<sep>The boards of health partnerships such as the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM) and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) create networks through cross-board membership (interlocks). While these networks bear the risk of cooptation and collusion in corporate governance, in public-private partnerships they may facilitate cooperation and responsiveness to health policy. This is feasible only through networks with specific characteristics discussed in this article. The analysis shows one whole network connecting 10 health partnerships established in Canada, Switzerland and United Sates, and belonging to two different subsectors (Product Development and Coordination and Financing). However, confluence on a few central interlocks makes the behavior of interlock individuals and organizations crucial for the effectiveness of the network, rendering good governance practices all the more important. At the same time, network clustering opens the possibility of tackling interdependencies at sub-level where expertise can be critically brought to bear. The article shows that, whether considered as a vector of collusion or as a bridge for coordination, the practice of overlooking partnership interlocks hinders both health policy oversight and strategic operation.<sep>With the growing number of corporate foundations and their increasing visibility as philanthropic actors, interests are raised regarding the way these corporate foundations function as well as about the nature of their relationship with the founding company. The foundation literature generally assumes that a foundation’s ability to create social impact and innovation rests to a large part on their independence from external control. However, corporate foundations are dependent to varying degrees on the support of their founding company. Therefore, apparent tensions between corporate control and the freedom a foundation needs to maximize its impact exist. In this chapter, we look at the special relationship between the two entities. Based on an exploratory study, we build ideal types of foundations in relation to their institutional independence. We then test and refine these through data gathered at the first European meeting of corporate foundations. The findings allow us to distill pull and push factors that lead to a stronger alignment of corporate goals and foundation activities. The ideal types show that full independence is not necessarily the best option, as corporate foundations can benefit greatly from corporate resources in achieving their social mission.<sep><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Transitioning to Strong Partnerships for the Sustainable Development Goals</em>&nbsp;is an edited volume dedicated to current developments regarding SDG 17 &ldquo;Partnerships for the Goals&rdquo;.

Recently, more attention has been given in academic research to the role of foundations as sustainable investors. According to the concept of socially responsible investing (SRI), foundations should integrate their social purposes into their investment strategies. However, foundations are also required to comply with national legal frameworks. Our research interest lies in those investment funds that are specifically developed for foundations in Germany. In this study, we answer two research questions: First, what are the characteristics of the market for foundation investment funds in Germany? Second, to what extent are foundation investment funds useful for foundations pursuing an SRI strategy? We build on a full sample comprising all 52 German foundation investment funds that are currently available and then use data from MSCI to apply a sustainability rating for these funds. With these data, we evaluate the financial performance of foundation investment funds in relation to their sustainability ratings. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was used to reduce complexity in the dataset and detect similarities among a set of objects. Our findings differentiate between two distinct clusters of foundation investment funds. The first “discrete” cluster represents the majority of funds, and these funds are generally smaller with lower performance and lower levels of SRI conformity. The funds in the second “attached” cluster are generally larger, more diversified, and have higher performance. Finally, we call for further research offer implications for both fund managers and foundation asset managers.<sep>Abstract Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) have become increasingly dependent on episodic volunteers (EVs), those that would help carry out an event with little training and expectation to commit to future events. Despite its importance to the survival of NPOs, the use of EVs with respect to fundraising has received little research focus. Furthermore, none of the existing studies identified examined how fundraising EVs differ from other EVs. This study seeks to contribute to our understanding of fundraising EVs using a global perspective. Data were generated using surveys distributed in seven countries, tallying more than 4,000 respondents. Variables included demographic characteristics, previous donation and volunteer history, motives, mode of volunteering, and overall experience. The data were analyzed by applying between‐group (logistic regression on participation) and within‐group analysis (ordered logistic regression on willingness to participate in the future). Data were further analyzed by examining differences by country. We found that country, gender, religion, income, employment, history of donations, mode of volunteering, and several motives, both intrinsic and extrinsic, were significant in the logistic regression analysis of participation in fundraising episodic volunteering. The ordered logistic analysis unexpectedly found that the only predictors to foster a willingness to engage again were the responsiveness of the event team and a desire to fulfill spiritual satisfaction. In recruiting and selecting EVs for fundraising events, NPOs should consider previous or current donors and those with regular volunteering experience and they should market volunteer opportunities towards those in search of spiritual fulfillment and meaning. Moreover, NPOs should prioritize quick and clear communication with fundraising EVs in order to foster a willingness to volunteer again. Lastly, NPOs should regularly assess for country‐specific factors and contexts that may affect episodic volunteering in fundraising events. Our paper illustrates who fundraising EVs are, their motives, how they choose to volunteer, and what contributes to their willingness to volunteer again. Given the limited research on fundraising EVs, this study serves to help lay the foundation of research for this unique subgroup. Our aim was to not only address the dearth of literature but serve as a springboard for future research on fundraising EVs.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>European union<sep>General partnership<sep>China<sep>Cold war<sep>Geopolitics<sep>Rivalry<sep>Position (finance)<sep>Competition (biology)<sep>Competitor analysis</keyword><title>Europe and China’s Belt and Road Initiative: GrowingConcerns, More Strategy.

We identify the channel using a regulatory spillover shock to the cross-section of mortgage-backed security prices: the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio. The shock increases secondary market prices for FHA-insured loans by granting them favorable regulatory status once securitized. Higher prices lower nonbanks’ funding costs, prompting them to loosen lending standards and originate more FHA-insured loans. This channel accounts for 22% of nonbanks’ growth in overall mortgage market share over 2013–2015. While the shock creates risks for financial stability, homeownership also increases.<sep>I show how financial intermediaries affect rental housing quality and affordability by supplying real estate investors with financing for quality improvement projects (i.e., renovations).

We report microbiota, host transcriptomics, epigenomics and genetics from matched inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa [50 Crohn’s disease (CD); 80 ulcerative colitis (UC); 31 controls]. Changes in community-wide and within-patient microbiota are linked with inflammation, but we find no evidence for a distinct microbial diagnostic signature, probably due to heterogeneous host-microbe interactions, and show only marginal microbiota associations with habitual diet. Epithelial DNA methylation improves disease classification and is associated with both inflammation and microbiota composition. Microbiota sub-groups are driven by dominant Enterbacteriaceae and Bacteroides species, representative strains of which are pro-inflammatory in vitro, are also associated with immune-related epigenetic markers. In conclusion, inflamed and non-inflamed colonic segments in both CD and UC differ in microbiota composition and epigenetic profiles.<sep>Clostridium butyricum is a butyrate-producing human gut symbiont that has been safely used as a probiotic for decades. C. butyricum strains have been investigated for potential protective or ameliorative effects in a wide range of human diseases, including gut-acquired infection, intestinal injury, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, neurodegenerative disease, metabolic disease, and colorectal cancer. In this review we summarize the studies on C. butyricum supplementation with special attention to proposed mechanisms for the associated health benefits and the supporting experimental evidence. These mechanisms center on molecular signals (especially butyrate) as well as immunological signals in the digestive system that cascade well beyond the gut to the liver, adipose tissue, brain, and more. The safety of probiotic C. butyricum strains appears well-established. We identify areas where additional human randomized controlled trials would provide valuable further data related to the strains' utility as an intervention.<sep>An increasing body of evidence implicates the resident gut microbiota as playing a critical role in type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathogenesis. We previously reported significant improvement in postprandial glucose control in human participants with T2D following 12-week administration of a 5-strain novel probiotic formulation ('WBF-011') in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled setting (NCT03893422). While the clinical endpoints were encouraging, additional exploratory measurements were needed in order to link the motivating mechanistic hypothesis - increased short-chain fatty acids - with markers of disease.Here we report targeted and untargeted metabolomic measurements on fasting plasma (n = 104) collected at baseline and end of intervention. Butyrate and ursodeoxycholate increased among participants randomized to WBF-011, along with compelling trends between butyrate and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). In vitro monoculture experiments demonstrated that the formulation's C. butyricum strain efficiently synthesizes ursodeoxycholate from the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholate during butyrogenic growth. Untargeted metabolomics also revealed coordinated decreases in intermediates of fatty acid oxidation and bilirubin, potential secondary signatures for metabolic improvement. Finally, improvement in HbA1c was limited almost entirely to participants not using sulfonylurea drugs. We show that these drugs can inhibit growth of formulation strains in vitro.To our knowledge, this is the first description of an increase in circulating butyrate or ursodeoxycholate following a probiotic intervention in humans with T2D, adding support for the possibility of a targeted microbiome-based approach to assist in the management of T2D. The efficient synthesis of UDCA by C. butyricum is also likely of interest to investigators of its use as a probiotic in other disease settings. The potential for inhibitory interaction between sulfonylurea drugs and gut microbiota should be considered carefully in the design of future studies.<sep>Introduction A growing body of evidence suggests that specific, naturally occurring gut bacteria are under-represented in the intestinal tracts of subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and that their functions, like gut barrier stability and butyrate production, are important to glucose and insulin homeostasis. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that enteral exposure to microbes with these proposed functions can safely improve clinical measures of glycemic control and thereby play a role in the overall dietary management of diabetes. Research design and methods We evaluated whether a probiotic comprised of these anaerobic bacteria would enhance dietary management by (1) manufacturing two novel probiotic formulations containing three (WBF-010) or five (WBF-011) distinct strains in a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) facility, (2) establishing consistent live-cell concentrations, (3) confirming safety at target concentrations dispensed in both animal and human studies and (4) conducting a 12-week parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study in which subjects previously diagnosed with T2D (n=76) were randomly assigned to a two times a day regimen of placebo, WBF-010 or WBF-011. Results No safety or tolerability issues were observed. Compared with the placebo group, subjects administered WBF-011 (which contains inulin, Akkermansia muciniphila, Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium butyricum, Bifidobacterium infantis and Anaerobutyricum hallii ) significantly improved in the primary outcome, glucose total area under the curve (AUC): −36.1 mg/dL/180 min, p=0.0500 and also improved in secondary outcomes, glycated hemoglobin (A1c): −0.6, glucose incremental-AUC: −28.6 mg/dL/180 min. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to administer four of the five strains to human subjects with T2D. This proof-of-concept study (clinical trial number NCT03893422 ) shows that the intervention was safe and well tolerated and that supplementation with WBF-011 improves postprandial glucose control. The limited sample size and intersubject variability justifies future studies designed to confirm and expand on these observations.<sep>Studies in type 2 diabetes (T2D) rodent models suggest the potential for individual microbial taxa in the human gut to improve or worsen metabolic disease via specific metabolites (signals) in hepatic or general circulation. We previously reported significant improvement in postprandial glucose control in T2D subjects following ingestion of a 5-strain novel probiotic formulation (INT) in a placebo (PBO) controlled setting. (DOI:10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001319) Here we report measurements of fecal and fasting circulating plasma metabolites, implicated as mediators of microbiome effects, collected before and after the 12-week intervention. Consistent with the hypothesized benefits of increased colonic production of butyrate, plasma butyrate increased in INT but not PBO (within group, concentration increase = 0.15 µM, p = 0.007; between group, p = 0.11), but not acetate nor propionate, paralleling changes in subject stool and production by in vitro culture. We detected changes consistent with enhanced fatty acid oxidation in INT relative to placebo, especially a decrease in medium chain fatty acids, their carnitinylates, and a decrease in bilirubin degradation byproducts. We also detected increases in certain bile acids, especially ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). In vitro monoculture supernatant showed that the formulation’s C. butyricum strain specifically and efficiently synthesizes UDCA during butyrogenic growth in rich media amended with the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid. Untargeted data also uncovered previously undocumented use of sulfonylurea (SFU), accounting for 6 out of 7 subjects with A1c non-response in the INT group. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an increase in circulating butyrate and UDCA due solely to a bacterial probiotic intervention in humans with T2D, and may help explain the observed improvement in postprandial glucose control.

A 12-week, double blind, placebo-controlled study of 2 MFs prepared GMP using only GRAS constituents (MF-1: BP; MF-2: BP + MR) in T2D (drug naive + metformin ± SFU, n=76), showed improved GC. See Table for demographics and key results. The primary endpoint was change from baseline (∆) in total glucose AUC0-180 min during a Boost Plus™ (720 cal) MTT. At 12 weeks, MF-2 yielded significant ∆s in both total (T) and incremental (I) glucose AUC0-180 min, (p=0.05 and 0.007 respectively). MF-1 improved only I glucose AUC0-180 min (p=0.05). Neither MF-1 or MF-2 impacted fasting glucose, T or I insulin AUC0-180 min, weight, BMI, HOMA-IR, lipids, or c-reactive protein. No safety or tolerability concerns were observed. Pre and post fecal microbial analyses are pending. Post hoc analyses revealed 2 interesting results. 1) SFU subjects across both study groups showed minimal response while subjects not using SFUs had greater ∆s in both T glucose AUC0-180 min (-24.4%) and placebo-corrected ∆ A1c (-0.7%). 2) MF-2 showed significant reductions in ALT consistent with improved liver health. In conclusion, 1) Interventions directed at increasing BP+MR may be of benefit in T2D. 2) MF-2 appears to be a safe and effective non-pharmacologic intervention for T2D which merits further investigation.

In some cases, the relationships between genotype and drug responses are obvious, such as the response of tumors with defined oncogenic mutations to inhibitors of those mutant proteins. However, covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors (G12Ci) induce clinical responses in less than half of patients with oncogenic KRAS G12C-driven lung cancer, illustrating that genomic alterations not obviously related to the drug mechanism can have a dramatic impact. We have developed and optimized an in vivo platform to identify pharmacogenomic interactions that dictate lung cancer responses to therapies. By coupling somatic genome editing, tumor barcoding, ultra-deep barcode sequencing, and robust statistical methods in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer, we can quantify and compare candidate therapies across thousands of clonal tumors of diverse tumor suppressor genotypes. This platform provides a uniquely high-throughput and quantitative assessment of tumors that are initiated de novo within the natural immunocompetent tissue environment. To uncover genotypes that are particularly important in controlling the response of tumors to oncogenic KRAS inhibition, we applied this platform to quantify the impact of 59 tumor suppressor genes on KRASG12C-driven lung tumor responses to G12Ci. Treatment resulted in approximately three-quarters reduction in both average tumor sizes and overall tumor burden, with a clear drug and dose dependence. Approximately one-quarter of inactivated genes significantly and consistently altered tumor responses across numerous G12Ci and replicate studies. Interestingly, most of these genes are thought to be in pathways not directly related to RAS signaling, and they exhibit a striking pattern in which treatment sensitivity is positively correlated with strength of the tumor suppressor effect. This pharmacogenomic profile for G12Ci was categorically different than the profiles we have observed for chemotherapy and other therapies. Overall, these results provide direct causal evidence that certain tumor suppressor genotypes dramatically shift the effectiveness of G12Ci in vivo and generate hypotheses about patients likely to benefit from G12Ci relative to alternatives. Analysis of available human data provides early clinical support for some of these hypotheses. Ongoing efforts to define pharmacogenomic profiles of combination therapies could be of even greater importance. Platforms that can accurately predict how tumor genotype drives responses have the potential to transform precision cancer therapy, enabling more effective patient stratification and therapy combinations.

Using a unique sample collected from security registration filings, we show that firms can issue new shares through DRSPPs without using underwriters and consequently, save a large part of direct costs. This economical form of equity offering helps high dividend paying firms retain a substantial amount of cash flow from operations. With this innovative strategic practice of capital‐raising, we provide direct evidence showing that the pecking order still drives firms' financing. Furthermore, equity offerings via DRSPPs can avoid negative stock market reactions around the issuance date.<sep>Abstract This paper examines the impact of innovator CEOs on their firms' IPO underpricing, long‐run performance and post‐IPO innovation. Firstly, we find that IPO firms led by innovator CEOs experience lower first‐day returns (indicating lower IPO underpricing). This phenomenon can be attributed to a CEO's innovative ability, as it plays a pivotal role in mitigating information asymmetry within the IPO market. Secondly, we observe that IPO firms with innovator CEOs have greater IPO long‐run performance. Lastly, our analysis reveals that IPO firms led by innovator CEOs demonstrate greater firm‐wide innovation up to 4 years after the IPO. Overall, our study highlights the effect of CEO characteristics on firm performance in the IPO market.<sep>In line with SEC regulations, U.S. firms tend to announce their earnings in specific weeks, resulting in clustered earnings releases. Our study examines whether this pattern of earnings releases leads to delayed market responses. We observe that firms announcing earnings in the two busy weeks of each season exhibit a stronger post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) compared to those in non-busy weeks. Additionally, we find that firms with fewer institutional investors, financial analysts, and smaller sizes are more susceptible to market under-reaction. These findings support the hypothesis that under-reaction plays a role in the occurrence of PEAD. We attribute this under-reaction mainly to investors' limited capacity to promptly process a large volume of earnings news simultaneously.<sep>Employing the group-specific herding measure, we explore the herding behavior in Chinese stock markets where a dual-group investor structure exists. Using high-frequency trading data, we find that the in-group herding tendency for most-informed investors and least-informed investors exhibits different patterns and has distinct effects on the market level herding as well as on subsequent market performances. Those effects are different in the “pre-peak” period and “post-peak” period from 7/2014 to 6/2016. Specifically, the evidence suggests that most-informed investors generally herd less than least-informed investors in the Chinese stock markets, but the gap narrows down when the market collapses and uncertainty increases. In addition, informed investors herd on fundamental factors and uninformed investors herd on non-fundamental factors only in the “post-peak” period.<sep>This study investigates effects of firm structure and risk exposure on cash holdings of multinational firms. We show that multinational firms that hold high levels of cash are stand-alone firms that operate businesses in one segment, but not diversified firms that operate businesses in multiple segments; the high levels of cash in multinational stand-alone firms are associated with their risk exposure to market uncertainty, policy uncertainty, and economic uncertainty. These risk exposures also have significant impact on future cash holdings, as well as current and future R&D expenditures. Our findings suggest that the precautionary motive still plays a key role in explaining the high cash holdings of multinational firms. In addition, we provide evidence that the tax motive is not sufficient to explain the high level of cash holdings in multinational stand-alone firms.<sep>This paper investigates whether designated sales agents hired to work on the At-the-Market (ATM) offerings act as liquidity traders and arbitrage apparent market inefficiencies such as post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD). Those sales agents can compete to provide liquidity in the presence of asymmetric information and continuously sell their new equity shares at any time. We find that the supply of liquidity shocks from ATM offerings negatively impacts the cross-section of risk premia. Consistent with the prediction of a dynamic rational expectations model, the well-documented PEAD anomaly disappears in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). When analyzing reversal magnitudes around earnings announcements, we show attenuated return reversals in ATM REITs compared with non-ATM REITs. Furthermore, institutional ownership, institutional herding, and adverse selection cannot explain future returns in firms with good earnings surprises below their expected levels.<sep>AbstractThis study examines the differences in debt maturity choice between Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) with At-the-Market (ATM) offerings and those without, as well as the subsequent changes in REIT debt maturity following the adoption of ATM programs. We find that ATM REITs consistently maintain higher levels of long-term debt than non-ATM REITs, even after implementing ATM offerings. It suggests that the capital raised through ATM offerings is not primarily utilized to reduce long-term debt.

Based on the multiple informant data from 303 firms in China, we find that formal institutional capital/informal institutional capital has an increasingly positive/inverted U-shaped effect on innovation performance. Exploratory market learning strengthens the formal institutional capital/informal institutional capital-innovation performance relations, while exploitative market learning weaken the inverted U-shaped effects informal institutional capital has on innovation performance.<sep>Based on institutional and resource dependence theories, this paper investigates how board structures and board share ownership affect young firms’ competitive nonconformity behaviours. By using the 7,391 competitive actions of fifteen commercial banks, we establish that larger board size leads young firms to adopt competitive nonconformity strategies while more foreign board directors and higher share ownership of board directors discourage young firms to employ competitive nonconformity strategies. The proposed study provides a better understanding of young firms' competitive behaviours under industrial deregulation where the pressure for institutional conformity is normally largely reduced.<sep>This study examines whether a firm’s environmental corporate social responsibility advances the growth of its new product performance, and investigates the moderating roles of a firm’s heterogeneous local institutional environment and ownership type. Based on a multi-informant survey dataset of 303 Chinese firms, we found that a firm’s environmental corporate social responsibility has a U-shaped relationship with the firm’s new product performance. In addition, compared with non-state-owned enterprises, state-owned enterprises with a higher environmental corporate social responsibility would receive relatively lower new product performance. Firms located in the provinces with a lower local institutional development level and higher environmental corporate social responsibility may experience relatively higher new product performance than firms located in the provinces with a higher local institutional development level.<sep>Deephouse raised an important question as to whether firms should be different or should be the same. The strategic balance perspective proposed by him suggests that by balancing the competing pressures of conformity and differentiation, a moderate degree of similarity is what contributes most to firm performance. This perspective has been widely accepted by scholars but follow-up studies are few and have achieved mixed results, leaving the knowledge base in this stream on shaky ground. This study conducted multiple replications of Deephouse’s seminal work across 155 manufacturing industries in China and across two methods to examine its replicability, generalizability, and robustness to methods and to provide additional and cumulative information. The results show that strategic balance perspective was replicable, but with context limitations. Our exploratory analyses indicate several possible boundary conditions and promising topics for furthering the development of strategic balance perspective. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.<sep>The purpose of this study is to examine the integration of information communication and technology and the development of eTourism as a field in tourism industry, as well as the implications of ICT usage on the Tourism industry in Indonesia. Using various types of literature such as scientific articles, articles, and books, this study emphasizes and examines the importance of ICT and how these acts contribute to the tourism and hospitality sector. Tourism sector businesses should be praised for their use of ICT and use of current technology such as social networks for client engagement. The use of ICT has been carefully monitored and deployed at a low cost, needing little technical knowledge from the workforce. The purpose of this article is to raise awareness among scholars, educators, legislators, leisure entrepreneurs, and public officials on the usefulness of ICT applications in the tourism and hospitality industries in Indonesia. The work is limited to Indonesia, and the conclusion is based on previous research. The report is totally prepared using Indonesian culture. The ICT application is only used as an independent variable in the study. As a result, there may be some other factors influencing the tourist and hospitality industries in Indonesia.<sep>Purpose This study aimed to explore the antecedents of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) internationalization and to compare the different resources required to enter different geographical regions. This study adds to the discussion on internationalization from a resource-based view (RBV) and a focus on dynamic capability, especially the linkage with resources such as digital capability, domestic industrial networks and the business-to-business (B2B) model. Design/methodology/approach This study used secondary data collected by an SME association in 2020, using a logistic regression model to examine the hypotheses. The respondents were selected according to stratified random sampling. Findings Digital capability and the B2B model significantly and positively affect the likelihood of internationalization by SMEs, while domestic industrial networks were negatively correlated with this process. In addition, Taiwanese SMEs with high digital capability tend to expand to North America, Europe, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, Oceania and the Middle East. Smaller firms tend to develop in Southeast Asia, whereas larger firms opt to establish business in Oceania. Research limitations/implications A research limitation is the generalizability of the sample. Findings could be enhanced if future studies include more industries and draw comparisons among different industries or countries. Future studies could explore digital entrepreneurship from a global perspective. Practical implications Managers need to emphasize better the development of digital capabilities and skills for SMEs. With limited financial resources and workforce, SMEs can strengthen the competence in international markets by adopting a suitable business model. When SMEs join an association to expand SMEs foreign networks, the study suggests that SMEs carefully evaluate the characteristics of each industrial association first, given that some associations are domestic-oriented. As for public policymakers, a project grant can be used to provide digital capability training for SME employees and owners or promote building a B2B model when internationalizing. Originality/value The authors' findings fill the research gaps in RBVs of internationalization, especially in linking resources such as digital capability, domestic industrial networks and the B2B model. The outcomes of this research serve as a reference not only to policymakers for improving the current SME ecosystem, but also to business practitioners positioning themselves in this system.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/45255/lecturer-or-senior-lecturer-in-accounting-and-or-finance/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5070527712", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5055878534", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong focus on accounting and finance, particularly in areas like equity offerings, IPO underpricing, and market behavior, which aligns well with the job's emphasis on accounting/finance and agribusiness/local government.

A heavy tailed error assumption based on Student’s t distribution helps reduce the bias. However, it may be less efficient in estimating parameters if the heavy tailed assumption is uniformly applied to all of the data when most of them are normally observed. We propose a mixture error assumption that selectively converts Gaussian errors into Student’s t errors according to latent outlier indicators, leveraging the best of the Gaussian and Student’s t errors; a parameter estimation can be not only robust but also accurate. Using simulated hospital profiling data and astronomical time series of brightness data, we demonstrate the potential for the proposed mixture error assumption to estimate parameters accurately in the presence of outliers. Supplemental materials for this article are available online.<sep>Data augmentation (DA) turns seemingly intractable computational problems into simple ones by augmenting latent missing data. In addition to computational simplicity, it is now well-established that DA equipped with a deterministic transformation can improve the convergence speed of iterative algorithms such as an EM algorithm or Gibbs sampler. In this article, we outline a framework for the transformation-based DA, which we call data transforming augmentation (DTA), allowing augmented data to be a deterministic function of latent and observed data, and unknown parameters. Under this framework, we investigate a novel DTA scheme that turns heteroscedastic models into homoscedastic ones to take advantage of simpler computations typically available in homoscedastic cases. Applying this DTA scheme to fitting linear mixed models, we demonstrate simpler computations and faster convergence rates of resulting iterative algorithms, compared with those under a non-transformation-based DA scheme. We also fit a Beta-Binomial model using the proposed DTA scheme, which enables sampling approximate marginal posterior distributions that are available only under homoscedasticity. An R package, Rdta, is publicly available at CRAN.<sep>In preparation for the era of the time-domain astronomy with upcoming large-scale surveys, we propose a state-space representation of a multivariate damped random walk process as a tool to analyze irregularly-spaced multi-filter light curves with heteroscedastic measurement errors. We adopt a computationally efficient and scalable Kalman-filtering approach to evaluate the likelihood function, leading to maximum $O(k^3n)$ complexity, where $k$ is the number of available bands and $n$ is the number of unique observation times across the $k$ bands. This is a significant computational advantage over a commonly used univariate Gaussian process that can stack up all multi-band light curves in one vector with maximum $O(k^3n^3)$ complexity. Using such efficient likelihood computation, we provide both maximum likelihood estimates and Bayesian posterior samples of the model parameters. Three numerical illustrations are presented; (i) analyzing simulated five-band light curves for a comparison with independent single-band fits; (ii) analyzing five-band light curves of a quasar obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe~82 to estimate the short-term variability and timescale; (iii) analyzing gravitationally lensed $g$- and $r$-band light curves of Q0957+561 to infer the time delay. Two R packages, Rdrw and timedelay, are publicly available to fit the proposed models.<sep>We propose a Bayesian meta-analysis to infer the current expansion rate of the Universe, called the Hubble constant ($H_0$), via time delay cosmography. Inputs of the meta-analysis are estimates of two properties for each pair of gravitationally lensed images; time delay and Fermat potential difference estimates with their standard errors. A meta-analysis can be appealing in practice because obtaining each estimate from even a single lens system involves substantial human efforts, and thus estimates are often separately obtained and published. This work focuses on combining these estimates from independent studies to infer $H_0$ in a robust manner. For this purpose, we adopt Student's $t$ error for the inputs of the meta-analysis. We investigate properties of the resulting $H_0$ estimate via two simulation studies with realistic imaging data. It turns out that the meta-analysis can infer $H_0$ with sub-percent bias and about 1 percent level of coefficient of variation, even when 30 percent of inputs are manipulated to be outliers. We also apply the meta-analysis to three gravitationally lensed systems, and estimate $H_0$ by $75.632 \\pm 6.918$ (km/second/Mpc), which covers a wide range of $H_0$ estimates obtained under different physical processes. An R package, h0, is publicly available for fitting the proposed meta-analysis.<sep>In the last two decades, Bayesian inference has become commonplace in astronomy. At the same time, the choice of algorithms, terminology, notation, and interpretation of Bayesian inference varies from one sub-field of astronomy to the next, which can lead to confusion to both those learning and those familiar with Bayesian statistics. Moreover, the choice varies between the astronomy and statistics literature, too. In this paper, our goal is two-fold: (1) provide a reference that consolidates and clarifies terminology and notation across disciplines, and (2) outline practical guidance for Bayesian inference in astronomy. Highlighting both the astronomy and statistics literature, we cover topics such as notation, specification of the likelihood and prior distributions, inference using the posterior distribution, and posterior predictive checking. It is not our intention to introduce the entire field of Bayesian data analysis -- rather, we present a series of useful practices for astronomers who already have an understanding of the Bayesian \"nuts and bolts\" and wish to increase their expertise and extend their knowledge. Moreover, as the field of astrostatistics and astroinformatics continues to grow, we hope this paper will serve as both a helpful reference and as a jumping off point for deeper dives into the statistics and astrostatistics literature.<sep>Cosmological parameters encoding our understanding of the expansion history of the Universe can be constrained by the accurate estimation of time delays arising in gravitationally lensed systems. We propose TD-CARMA, a Bayesian method to estimate cosmological time delays by modelling the observed and irregularly sampled light curves as realizations of a Continuous Auto-Regressive Moving Average (CARMA) process. Our model accounts for heteroskedastic measurement errors and microlensing, an additional source of independent extrinsic long-term variability in the source brightness. The semi-separable structure of the CARMA covariance matrix allows for fast and scalable likelihood computation using Gaussian Process modeling. We obtain a sample from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters using a nested sampling approach. This allows for ``painless'' Bayesian Computation, dealing with the expected multi-modality of the posterior distribution in a straightforward manner and not requiring the specification of starting values or an initial guess for the time delay, unlike existing methods. In addition, the proposed sampling procedure automatically evaluates the Bayesian evidence, allowing us to perform principled Bayesian model selection. TD-CARMA is parsimonious, and typically includes no more than a dozen unknown parameters. We apply TD-CARMA to six doubly lensed quasars HS 2209+1914, SDSS J1001+5027, SDSS J1206+4332, SDSS J1515+1511, SDSS J1455+1447, SDSS J1349+1227, estimating their time delays as $-21.96 \\pm 1.448$, $120.93 \\pm 1.015$, $111.51 \\pm 1.452$, $210.80 \\pm 2.18$, $45.36 \\pm 1.93$ and $432.05 \\pm 1.950$ respectively. These estimates are consistent with those derived in the relevant literature, but are typically two to four times more precise.<sep>Abstract Cosmological parameters encoding our understanding of the expansion history of the universe can be constrained by the accurate estimation of time delays arising in gravitationally lensed systems.

These estimates are consistent with those derived in the relevant literature, but are typically two to four times more precise.<sep>Abstract Most general-purpose classification methods, such as support-vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), fail to account for an unusual characteristic of astronomical data: known measurement error uncertainties. In astronomical data, this information is often given in the data but discarded because popular machine learning classifiers cannot incorporate it. We propose a simulation-based approach that incorporates heteroscedastic measurement error into an existing classification method to better quantify uncertainty in classification. The proposed method first simulates perturbed realizations of the data from a Bayesian posterior predictive distribution of a Gaussian measurement error model. Then, a chosen classifier is fit to each simulation. The variation across the simulations naturally reflects the uncertainty propagated from the measurement errors in both labeled and unlabeled data sets. We demonstrate the use of this approach via two numerical studies. The first is a thorough simulation study applying the proposed procedure to SVM and RF, which are well-known hard and soft classifiers, respectively. The second study is a realistic classification problem of identifying high- z (2.9 ≤ z ≤ 5.1) quasar candidates from photometric data. The data are from merged catalogs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Spitzer IRAC Equatorial Survey, and the Spitzer-HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area Survey. The proposed approach reveals that out of 11,847 high- z quasar candidates identified by a random forest without incorporating measurement error, 3146 are potential misclassifications with measurement error. Additionally, out of 1.85 million objects not identified as high- z quasars without measurement error, 936 can be considered new candidates with measurement error.<sep>In recent years, breakthroughs in methods and data have enabled gravitational time delays to emerge as a very powerful tool to measure the Hubble constant $H_0$. However, published state-of-the-art analyses require of order 1 year of expert investigator time and up to a million hours of computing time per system. Furthermore, as precision improves, it is crucial to identify and mitigate systematic uncertainties. With this time delay lens modelling challenge we aim to assess the level of precision and accuracy of the modelling techniques that are currently fast enough to handle of order 50 lenses, via the blind analysis of simulated datasets. The results in Rung 1 and Rung 2 show that methods that use only the point source positions tend to have lower precision ($10 - 20\\%$) while remaining accurate. In Rung 2, the methods that exploit the full information of the imaging and kinematic datasets can recover $H_0$ within the target accuracy ($ |A| < 2\\%$) and precision ($< 6\\%$ per system), even in the presence of poorly known point spread function and complex source morphology. A post-unblinding analysis of Rung 3 showed the numerical precision of the ray-traced cosmological simulations to be insufficient to test lens modelling methodology at the percent level, making the results difficult to interpret. A new challenge with improved simulations is needed to make further progress in the investigation of systematic uncertainties. For completeness, we present the Rung 3 results in an appendix, and use them to discuss various approaches to mitigating against similar subtle data generation effects in future blind challenges.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Toeplitz matrix<sep>Grating<sep>Boundary layer<sep>Safety monitoring<sep>Passband<sep>Boundary (topology)<sep>Field (mathematics)<sep>Trigonometric

In this paper, a new non-isothermal two-phase flow model is presented that improves upon the simulation accuracy and capability of historical reduced drift-flux models (RDFM) while still retaining high computational efficiency. Built on the “no pressure wave” assumption of the RDFM, our new RDFM achieves improvements through calculating the temperature dynamics, considering interface mass transfer (i.e., gas-in-oil solubility behavior), and introducing a new lumped pressure dynamics model. By including these physical factors that are critical for practical applications, the proposed RDFM shows higher simulation accuracy and capability compared to historical RDFMs. The validity of the proposed model is proven by comparing it to field measurements, benchmark models, and the classical drift-flux model. Moreover, the proposed RDFM successfully retains the high computational efficiency of historical RDFMs even with the addition of the aforementioned complex physical dynamics. When conducting full-scale gas influx simulations, the proposed RDFM achieves a computational speed at more than two orders of magnitude faster than real-time. Due to its good performance on both computational efficiency and simulation accuracy, the proposed model is suitable for real-time applications in most well construction scenarios. It is especially superior to historical RDFMs when simulating more complicated but still common scenarios, e.g., deepwater wells drilled in high-pressure high-temperature environments, and wells experiencing gas-in-oil solubility behavior.<sep>Abstract In managed pressure drilling (MPD), robust and fast event detection is critical for timely event identification and diagnosis, as well as executing well control actions as quickly as possible. In current event detection systems (EDSs), signal noise and uncertainties often cause missed and false alarms, and automated diagnosis of the event type is usually restricted to certain event types. A new EDS method is proposed in this paper to overcome these shortcomings. The new approach uses a multivariate online change point detection (OCPD) method based on elliptic envelope for event detection. The method is robust against signal noise and uncertainties, and is able to detect abnormal features within a minute or less, using only a few data points. A deep neural network (DNN) is utilized for estimating the occurrence probability of various drilling events, currently encompassing (but not limited to) six event types: liquid kick, gas kick, lost circulation, plugged choke, plugged bit, and drillstring washout. The OCPD and the DNN are integrated together and demonstrate better performance with respect to robustness and accuracy. The training and testing of the OCPD and the DNN were conducted on a large dataset representing various drilling events, which was generated using a field-validated two-phase hydraulics software. Compared to current EDS methods, the new system shows the following advantages: (1) lower missed alarm rate; (2) lower false alarm rate; (3) earlier alarming; and (4) significantly improved classification capability that also allows for further extension to even more drilling events.<sep>Closed-loop geothermal systems (CLGS) have been recently proposed as an alternative to the conventional enhanced geothermal system (EGS) concept to address many of the issues of concern with EGS, such as potential contamination of the circulating fluid and short-circuiting. Deep CLGS wells drilled in rock formations with in-situ temperatures above 200 °C could in theory be drilled anywhere around the world, thereby allowing for globally scalable geothermal energy production. A novel concept of integrating a managed pressure operation (MPO) system with deep CLGS (DCLGS) is presented here. The concept includes an open-hole completion of the lateral section, while the automatically controlled MPO system maintains wellbore integrity and avoids fluid contamination. A combined thermal and hydraulic model is also developed to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept. Using a robust semi-implicit numerical algorithm, the model can simulate the fast transients in a well, which enables the application of automated MPO control for real-time control of a DCLGS. Simulation results show that a 7 km deep U-shaped well with a 7 km open-hole lateral with a reservoir temperature of 250 °C can generate a thermal power of around 28 MW initially when the pump rate is set to 350 m3/h. The results also show that casing of the lateral section has little impact on the outlet temperatures and thermal powers. An optimally insulated return section can increase the output power by 2%. The effect of pump rate is also studied. Even though the outlet temperature decreases, increasing the pump rate can improve the thermal power by 15%,<sep>With Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) becoming increasingly important to oil and gas well construction, there has been a growing demand for comprehensive models that can accurately describe the well hydraulic dynamics, especially for complex well geometries, High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) conditions, during well control events, etc. To meet this demand, new multi-phase hydraulic models have been developed. However, despite their improvement over the traditional lumped parameter models, these models typically do not consider detailed temperature effects, which markedly influence well hydraulics and need to be explicitly considered for accurate MPD control. The development of a new integrated multi-phase thermal and hydraulic modeling framework is presented in this paper. This integrated model can estimate the mud temperature in the drillstring and the annulus, as well as the temperature variations of the formation during complex well control situations. The model uses a semi-implicit finite volume approach and solves the mixture energy equation for the wellbore fluids, assuming that all the phases are in thermal equilibrium. Heat transfer between the drillstring and wellbore fluids, and between the wellbore fluids and the formation is calculated using thermal resistance networks. The steady-state and transient temperature behaviors during mud circulation are compared to the steady-state analytical model by Hasan and Kabir and commercial software. These comparisons show good agreement for both steady-state and transient cases. To demonstrate the importance of accurate temperature estimation of the drillstring and annulus fluids in HPHT conditions, offshore kick scenarios for non-aqueous drilling fluids and dynamic kick control methods are simulated. Simulation results indicate that the model<sep>Well construction is a complex multi-step process that requires decision-making at every step. These decisions, currently made by humans, are inadvertently influenced by past experiences and human factor issues, such as the situational awareness of the decision-maker. This human bias often results in operational inefficiencies or safety and environmental issues. While there are approaches and tools to monitor well construction operations, there are none that evaluate potential action sequences and scenarios and select the best possible sequence of actions. This paper defines a generalized iterative methodology for setting up a digital twin to address this shortcoming. Depending on its application, the objectives and constraints around the twin are formulated. The digital twin is then built using a cyclical process of defining the required outputs, identifying and integrating the necessary process models, and aggregating the required data streams. The twin is set up such that it is predictive in nature, thus enabling scenario analysis. The method is demonstrated here by setting up twinning systems for two different categories of problems. First, an integrated multi-model twin to replicate borehole cleaning operations for stuck-pipe prevention is developed and tested. Second, the creation, implementation, and testing of a twinning system for assisting with operational planning and logistics is demonstrated by considering the time it takes to drill a well to total depth (TD). These twins are also used to simulate multiple future scenarios to quantify the effects of different actions on eventual outcomes. Such systems can help improve operational performance by allowing more informed human, as well as automated,<sep>Abstract Non-aqueous drilling fluids used in deepwater drilling operations are conducive to the dissolution of formation gas during wellbore influx events, increasing the risk of gas kicks going unnoticed. This can lead to hazardous riser gas unloading events if kicks are allowed to pass the subsea BOPs and come out of solution at the bubble point at shallow riser depth. One possible solution to handle and even prevent these events is to generate enough backpressure using Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) with a Rotating Control Device (RCD) to keep the dissolved gas in solution. However, for large kicks, the required backpressure may exceed riser pressure limits. A novel kick handling procedure using a dilution control strategy (DCS) is proposed here to handle gas influxes and subsequent gas unloading events. The idea behind this DCS is to inject mud into the riser through the boost line while simultaneously slowing down the circulation rate through the drillstring as the dissolved kick passes the open subsea BOPs. The kick will then get diluted and will be distributed across a larger annular space leading to a significantly decreased gas concentration that can be more easily handled by the MPD system with lower backpressure. The feasibility of the DCS is investigated in this paper using a multi-phase flow model which is validated against experimental data for a gas kick in oil-based mud. Simulation results for a demonstration case show that a kick entering the well at 18,500 ft with 2,250 kg gas can be thoroughly eliminated with a 3:1 dilution ratio<sep>Non-aqueous drilling fluids are generally favored in risered deepwater drilling operations for their capability to significantly improve drilling performance. However, their use may increase the difficulty of gas kick detection and handling, due to the high solubility of gas at downhole pressure and temperature conditions. A novel managed pressure drilling (MPD) control strategy is proposed here to handle gas kicks and prevent riser gas unloading (RGU) events in cases of gas influxes in non-aqueous drilling fluids. With the proposed strategy, the dissolved gas kick is diluted to a less severe level after it passes the subsea blow-out preventers by injecting mud into the riser through the booster line. Since the dissolved gas concentration is decreased after dilution, it is easier to mitigate or even fully eliminate an RGU event by applying an appropriate MPD backpressure. This MPD backpressure keeps the kick in solution when it is in the riser, and only allows it to come out of solution after passing the MPD choke. The proposed strategy's effectiveness is demonstrated using multiphase flow model simulations. The modeling approach considers the transient behavior of the two-phase gas-fluid mixture, and is validated against full-scale experimental data. Simulation results for a typical deepwater drilling operation show that the proposed MPD control strategy with riser dilution can greatly improve both the safety and speed of handling gas kicks in deepwater drilling. The improved safety derives from the ability to eliminate RGU events, and the increased speed comes from handling the kick directly in the riser using MPD backpressure and booster<sep>For a robust and efficient automated Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) operation, the choke controller requires an accurate hydraulics model that can be run at minimum computational expense. Integration of a suitable thermal model would improve the accuracy of the hydraulics model used by the choke controller. The use of existing thermal models, however, comes with additional computational costs that are a hurdle when aiming to achieve real-time control at sufficiently fast time-scales. In this paper, a quasi-steady thermal model is integrated with an automated MPD control approach that uses a reduced Drift-Flux Model (RDFM) to describe the hydraulics of multiphase flow in real-time. This integrated modeling approach provides the dynamic temperature profile along a well without increasing the computational expense. The energy equation is solved using the finite-difference method (FDM) in an explicit scheme, with all the temperature-dependent parameters updated in accordance with the calculated temperature profile in each computation step. The RDFM is also reformulated to account for the heat transfer between the gas and the surroundings. This modified model is then incorporated into an automated observer algorithm to estimate parameters, e.g. volume of gas expansion (dependent on temperature), which are used by the controller for choke opening manipulation. Validations are first conducted in a simulation environment for the scenario with a dynamic temperature profile along the well. The results indicate that the proposed modeling approach offers significant improvement compared to approaches which do not consider thermodynamics. A good agreement of the temperature results is observed between the proposed approach and existing models as<sep>Abstract There is a growing need for comprehensive multi-phase hydraulic models that can accurately model more complex well control situations associated with the use of Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) techniques, complex well geometries, High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) conditions, riser gas unloading, etc. A new thermal model integrated with previously developed multi-phase hydraulics software is presented here to address this need. This de-coupled thermal model is added to a sophisticated multi-phase flow code to estimate the mud temperature in the drillstring and the annulus and in the formation adjacent to the well during complex well control situations. The model uses an explicit finite volume approach and solves the mixture energy equation for the wellbore fluids, assuming that all the phases are at thermal equilibrium. Heat transfer between the drillstring and the wellbore fluid, and between wellbore and formation is calculated using a thermal resistance network. Axial heat conduction in the mud and heat generation (e.g. at the bit) are accounted for. The steady-state results of the proposed thermal model are compared to the steady-state Hasan and Kabir model and commercial software. In addition, the transient, time-dependent temperature behavior during mud circulation is compared against the results of the commercial software. Results show a very good match for both steady-state and transient cases. Kick scenarios are simulated to show the importance of accurate temperature estimation of the drillstring and annulus fluids in HPHT conditions. Using advanced numerical schemes, a comprehensive model for heat transfer and energy storage in combination with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes this<sep>Abstract Deep closed-loop geothermal systems (DCLGS) are introduced as an alternative to traditional enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) for green energy production that is globally scalable and dispatchable. Recent modeling work shows that DCLGS can generate an amount of power that is similar to that of EGS, while overcoming many of the downsides of EGS (such as induced seismicity, emissions to air, mineral scaling etc.). DCLGS wells can be constructed by leveraging oil and gas extended reach drilling (ERD) and high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) drilling expertise in particular. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. First, we demonstrate that DCLGS wells can generate significant geothermal power, i.e. on the order of 25-30 MWt per borehole initially. To this extent, we have developed a coupled hydraulic-thermal model, validated using oil and gas well cases, that can simulate various DCLGS well configurations. Secondly, we highlight the technology gaps and needs that still exist for economically drilling DCLGS wells, showing that it is possible to extend oil and gas technology, expertise and experience in ERD and HPHT drilling to construct complex DCLGS wells. Our coupled hydraulic-thermal sensitivity analyses show that there are key well drilling and design parameters that will ultimately affect DCLGS operating efficiency, including strategic deployment of managed pressure drilling / operation (MPD/MPO) technology, the use of vacuum-insulated tubing (VIT), and the selection of the completion in the high-temperature rock formations. Results show that optimum design and execution can boost initial geothermal power generation to 25 MWt and beyond. In addition, historical ERD and HPHT well experience is<sep>Abstract Hydraulic models are widely used in the drilling industry to simulate downhole conditions, estimate pressures and velocities in the wellbore, and ensure sufficient flow rates are maintained. While wellbore hydraulics are hugely dependent on cuttings transport and deposition, most of the models in the industry either completely ignore cuttings transport, or use overly simplified methods (e.g., correction factors) to include its effects. This leads to inaccurate pressure estimations, especially during transient drilling conditions. A robust cuttings transport algorithm is developed and integrated with a real-time hydraulics model. The algorithm discretizes the annulus and estimates the cuttings bed blockage, volume fraction of suspended cuttings and cuttings and mud velocities both at steady-state and transient conditions for each discretized cell. Solid-liquid slip velocity, cuttings bed generation and erosion, and mixture viscosity and density are accounted for using experimental models. The effect of the cuttings bed and suspended cuttings on friction factors, hydrostatic pressure, and mud rheology are included in the hydraulics model, providing accurate estimates of the transient pressure and velocity profiles. Moreover, a dynamic discretization algorithm is implemented to account for extended, real-world drilling operations. The hole cleaning algorithm provides an estimation of the real-time cuttings bed and suspended cuttings concentrations, as well as important parameters such as the weight of cuttings in the wellbore, maximum cuttings bed blockage, and clean-up cycles required to clean the wellbore. Through the integration with the hydraulics model, pressure and velocity profiles are accurately estimated, including minimum cuttings velocity in the wellbore, standpipe pressure, and bottomhole pressure. Results show<sep>Abstract Model-based methods such as torque and drag, hydraulics, hole cleaning, and downhole dynamics have improved over the past years for pre-job design and post-analysis of drilling operations. However, there is a still a large gap in extending these traditionally manual processes and scaling them up for model-based, real-time decision support systems. Significant opportunities exist in applying these towards drilling hazard avoidance, performance diagnostics, and optimization. It is desirable to have an automated solution that orchestrates data ingestion and model calculations based on physics-based, data driven, or hybrid methods, to analyze real-time field data and enable valuable insights into operations. In this context, cognitive twins refer to the ability to deliver actionable insights for real-time optimization and hazard avoidance through systematic automation of data and model pipelines. In this work, a sustainable real-time solution is proposed comprising of data aggregation, cleansing, analytics, and cognitive twins to enable the automated orchestration, analysis, and insight delivery from drilling models. This process drives the scalability of the system – ensuring evergreen models and analysis are always available across all rigs and wells in a drilling fleet. Methods of modeling and analysis combine data driven methods with physics-based constraints to compute certain key quantities (e.g., friction factors, pressure deviations, and cuttings bed height). These quantities contain results and intermediate features which can be used for machine learning methods to drive fleet performance optimization above and beyond well-level analysis. We applied these methods to both onshore and offshore wells in real-time to identify and automatically detect several early warning signs<sep>Abstract Improper hole cleaning is a major cause of non-productive time (NPT) in drilling. Current hole cleaning practices are mostly based on experience, rules of thumb and simplistic calculations. Hence, they are not reliable and do not work as expected in all scenarios. There is the need for a robust, fast, and accurate approach to simulate cuttings transport, and provide reliable and useful estimations of the hole conditions in real-time. In this paper, a transient cuttings transport model is presented for real-time hole cleaning simulations. The model solves the transient conservation equations using a drift-flux modeling approach, which is applied to describe the multiphase flow of cuttings and fluid in the wellbore. The model uses experimentally derived equations that account for the effects of pump rate, pipe rotation, eccentricity, fluid rheology, inclination, etc. on cuttings transport. A fast numerical solver is used to enable real-time simulations, while providing numerical stability that is crucial to maintain the modeling convergence under area discontinuities. Using small time-steps, the model captures pressure wave behavior, which is necessary for simulating managed pressure drilling (MPD) operations. Pressure-dependent mud density, non-Newtonian viscosity, and cuttings slip velocity models are used to estimate downhole parameters such as pressure, cuttings concentration, bed height, drilling fluid and cuttings velocities, etc. The model can provide a drilling crew with accessible real-time simulation results on the rig for monitoring the hole cleaning operation and preventing problems from happening. Case studies are performed based on field experiments to analyze the effectiveness of the developed model on avoiding operational problems<sep>Abstract Riser gas unloading events in deepwater subsea well construction operations are very hazardous and difficult to control. Gas kicks may go unnoticed when gas dissolves in non-aqueous fluids (NAF), with dissolved gas volumes not showing significant pit gains on surface when conventional well control indicators are used. Once dissolved gas is circulated above subsea blow-out preventers (BOP) and comes out of solution at pressure and temperature conditions below the bubble point, it can quickly displace a large mud volume in the riser at relatively shallow depths, leaving little time to react for diverting the gas at surface. In this paper, we present a variant of the constant bottom-hole pressure (CBHP) approach to managed pressure drilling (MPD) that offers a comprehensive way to manage and control riser gas unloading behavior. The technique enables early kick detection, thereby allowing more sensitive diagnosis of gas kicks going into solution, and preventing them from creating a hazardous situation in the first place. It also allows for the application of back-pressure on the dissolved gas-NAF fluid mixture in the riser, in order to delay, minimize or even prevent gas breaking out close to surface (in case dissolved gas is allowed above the subsea BOPs). Complicating factors include the pressure integrity limits of the marine riser, and the fact that the nature of any kick (whether it is gas, fluid or a combination, its detailed composition, volume, etc.) is generally unknown. It is argued here that such challenges are best met in the field by using automated MPD control methodology.<sep>Summary Riser gas unloading events in subsea well construction are hazardous and difficult to control. When a gas influx enters the wellbore and dissolves in nonaqueous fluids (NAFs), it may go unnoticed because the pit gain on the surface may be minimal and remain below the detection threshold when using conventional well control indicators. Once the dissolved gas is circulated up and comes out of the solution at pressure and temperature conditions below the bubblepoint, it can quickly displace a large volume of mud in the riser or the chokeline. When this breaking out of gas occurs at a shallow depth, it leaves little time for the rig crew to react. In this paper, we present a novel managed pressure drilling (MPD) approach for riser gas unloading control that makes use of a pressurized riser drilling (PRD) controller. The PRD method employs the constant bottomhole pressure (CBHP) controller for normal operations (e.g., drilling and circulation of kick), whereas it offers a more comprehensive way to manage and control a riser gas unloading behavior. The PRD choke controller dynamically applies a backpressure on the dissolved gas–NAF mixture in the riser to delay, minimize, or even prevent the gas breaking out at locations closer to the surface. The control algorithm considers the pressure limits of the riser and of the openhole formations and can adjust for kick uncertainties (e.g., whether the kick is a gas, liquid, or both, its volume and distribution). The proposed PRD controller consists of three operation modes: pressure control mode, flow control mode,</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Commodity<sep>Plug and play<sep>Negotiation<sep>Cyber-physical system<sep>Testbed<sep>Smart grid<sep>Information privacy<sep>Control (management)<sep>Honeypot<sep>Anomaly detection<sep>Tracing<sep>Replay attack<sep>Identification (biology)<sep>Host controller interface<sep>Overhead (engineering)<sep>Drone<sep>Compromise<sep>The Internet<sep>Software deployment<sep>Interface (matter)<sep>Vendor<sep>Home security<sep>Software<sep>Scale (ratio)<sep>Confidentiality<sep>Construct (python library)<sep>Intrusion detection system<sep>USB<sep>Enterprise private network<sep>Process (computing)<sep>Spoofing attack<sep>Network packet<sep>Internet of Things<sep>Access control<sep>Network security<sep>Implementation<sep>TRACE (psycholinguistics)<sep>Network forensics<sep>USB hub<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Reliability (semiconductor)<sep>Telemedicine<sep>Software-defined networking<sep>Latency (audio)<sep>Malware<sep>Set (abstract data type)<sep>eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI)<sep>Work (physics)<sep>Class (philosophy)<sep>Protocol (science)<sep>Resource (disambiguation)<sep>PC Card<sep>Denial-of-service attack<sep>Power (physics)<sep>Home automation<sep>Authentication (law)<sep>Emergency management<sep>Digital forensics<sep>Alternative medicine<sep>Bedroom<sep>Computer forensics<sep>Eavesdropping</keyword><title>Verifying Internet of Things Safety and Security in Physical Spaces<sep>A digital forensics framework for smart settings<sep>Dynamically detecting USB attacks in hardware<sep>On-device Security and Privacy Mechanisms for Resource-limited Devices: A Bottom-up Approach<sep>Z-IoT: Passive Device-class Fingerprinting of ZigBee and Z-Wave IoT Devices<sep>Real-time Analysis of Privacy-(un)aware IoT Applications<sep>HEKA: A Novel Intrusion Detection System for Attacks to Personal Medical Devices<sep>KRATOS: Multi-User Multi-Device-Aware Access Control System for the Smart Home<sep>A survey on security and privacy issues of UAVs<sep>Ivycide: Smart Intrusion Detection System Against E-IoT Driver Threats<sep>CSPoweR-Watch: A Cyber-Resilient Residential Power Management System<sep>A System-level Behavioral Detection Framework for Compromised CPS Devices<sep>A System-level Behavioral Detection Framework for Compromised CPS Devices: Smart-Grid Case<sep><scp>LGuard</scp> : Securing Enterprise-IoT Systems against Serial-Based Attacks via Proprietary Communication Buses<sep>S-Pot: A Smart Honeypot Framework with Dynamic Rule Configuration for SDN<sep>MAD-IoT: Memory Anomaly Detection for the Internet of Things<sep>USB-Watch: A Dynamic Hardware-Assisted USB Threat Detection Framework<sep>HDMI-Walk: Attacking HDMI Distribution Networks via Consumer Electronic Control Protocol<sep>Survey on Enterprise Internet-of-Things Systems (E-IoT): A Security\n  Perspective<sep>Survey on Enterprise Internet-of-Things systems (E-IoT): A security perspective<sep>Aegis: A Context-aware Security Framework for Smart Home Systems.<sep>PoisonIvy: (In)secure Practices of Enterprise IoT Systems in Smart\n  Buildings<sep>PoisonIvy: (In)secure Practices of Enterprise IoT Systems in Smart Buildings<sep>HDMI-Watch: Smart Intrusion Detection System Against HDMI Attacks<sep>CPS Device-Class Identification via Behavioral Fingerprinting: From Theory to Practice<sep>Who’s Controlling My Device?

Advanced software-based detection schemes (deeper operating system level) are used to identify the malicious nature of such mimic devices. However, a powerful adversary (e.g., as rootkits or advanced persistent threats) can subvert those software-based detection schemes. To address these concerns, we present our ongoing work to dynamically detect these threats in hardware. Specifically, we utilize a novel hardware-assistance mechanism to collect unaltered USB data at the physical layer which is fed into a machine learning-based classifier to determine the true nature of the USB device.<sep>This doctoral dissertation introduces novel mechanisms to provide on-device security and privacy for resource-limited smart devices and their applications. These mechanisms aim to cover five fundamental contributions in the emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Industrial IoT (IIoT) fields. First, we present a host-based fingerprinting solution for device identification that is complementary to other security services like device authentication and access control. Then, we design a kernel- and user-level detection framework that aims to discover compromised resource-limited devices based on behavioral analysis. Further we apply dynamic analysis of smart devices’ applications to uncover security and privacy risks in real-time. Then, we describe a solution to enable digital forensics analysis on data extracted from interconnected resource-limited devices that form a smart environment. Finally, we offer to researchers from industry and academia a collection of benchmark solutions for the evaluation of the discussed security<sep>In addition to traditional networking devices (e.g., gateways, firewalls), current corporate and industrial networks integrate resource-limited Internet of Things (IoT) devices like smart outlets and smart sensors. In these settings, cyber attackers can bypass traditional security solutions and spoof legitimate IoT devices to gain illegal access to the systems. Thus, IoT device-class identification is crucial to protect critical networks from unauthorized access. In this paper, we propose Z-IoT, the first fingerprinting framework used to identify IoT device classes that utilize ZigBee and Z-Wave protocols. Z-IoT monitors idle network traffic among IoT devices to implement signature-based device-class fingerprinting mechanisms. Utilizing passive packet capturing techniques and optimal selection of filtering criteria and machine learning algorithms, Z-IoT identifies different types of IoT devices while guaranteeing the anonymity of the network data. To test Z-IoT's efficacy, we implemented several testbeds, including a total of 39 commodity IoT devices that<sep>Abstract Abstract: Users trust IoT apps to control and automate their smart devices. These apps necessarily have access to sensitive data to implement their functionality. However, users lack visibility into how their sensitive data is used, and often blindly trust the app developers. In this paper, we present IoTWATcH, a dynamic analysis tool that uncovers the privacy risks of IoT apps in real-time. We have designed and built IoTWATcH through a comprehensive IoT privacy survey addressing the privacy needs of users. IoTWATCH operates in four phases: (a) it provides users with an interface to specify their privacy preferences at app install time, (b) it adds extra logic to an app’s source code to collect both IoT data and their recipients at runtime, (c) it uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to construct a model that classifies IoT app data into intuitive privacy labels, and (d)<sep>Modern Smart Health Systems (SHS) involve the concept of connected personal medical devices. These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them.

Traditional access control mechanisms consider one unique trusted user that controls the access to the devices. However, multi-user multi-device smart home settings pose fundamentally different challenges to traditional single-user systems. For instance, in a multi-user environment, users have conflicting, complex, and dynamically changing demands on multiple devices, which cannot be handled by traditional access control techniques. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce Kratos, a novel multiuser and multi-device-aware access control mechanism that allows smart home users to flexibly specify their access control demands. Kratos has three main components: user interaction module, backend server, and policy manager. Users can specify their desired access control settings using the interaction module which are translated into access control policies in the backend server. The<sep>In the 21st century, the industry of drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), has witnessed a rapid increase with its large number of airspace users. The tremendous benefits of this technology in civilian applications such as hostage rescue and parcel delivery will integrate smart cities in the future. Nowadays, the affordability of commercial drones expands their usage on a large scale. However, the development of drone technology is associated with vulnerabilities and threats due to the lack of efficient security implementations. Moreover, the complexity of UAVs in software and hardware triggers potential security and privacy issues. Thus, posing significant challenges for the industry, academia, and governments. In this paper, we extensively survey the security and privacy issues of UAVs by providing a systematic classification at four levels: Hardware-level, Software-level, Communication-level, and Sensor-level. In particular, for each level, we thoroughly investigate (1) common vulnerabilities<sep>The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the proliferation of smart environments worldwide.

In effect, E-IoT systems present an unprecedented, under-researched, and unexplored threat vector for an attacker. In this work, we focus on E-IoT drivers, software modules used to integrate devices into E-IoT systems, as an attack mechanism.

These systems retrieve vital information from various Internet-connected resources in a smart grid to function effectively. However, relying on such resources results in them being susceptible to cyber attacks. Malicious actors can exploit the interconnections between the resources to perform nefarious tasks such as modifying critical firmware, sending bogus sensor data, or stealing sensitive information. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates PowerWatch, a solution that detects compromised devices in the smart grid with Cyber-secure Power Router (CSPR), a smart energy management system. The goal is to ascertain whether or not such a device has operated maliciously. To achieve this, PowerWatch utilizes a machine learning model that analyzes information from system and library call lists extracted from CSPR in order to<sep>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a significant role in our critical infrastructure networks from power-distribution to utility networks.

These systems are widely used in government or smart private offices, smart buildings/homes, conference rooms, schools, hotels, and similar professional settings. However, even with their widespread use, the security of many E-IoT systems and components has not been researched in the literature. To address this research gap, we focus on E-IoT communication buses, one of the core components used to connect E-IoT devices, and introduce LightningStrike attacks that demonstrate several weaknesses with E-IoT proprietary communication protocols used in E-IoT communication buses. Specifically, we show that popular E-IoT proprietary communication protocols are susceptible to Denial-of-Service (DoS), eavesdropping, impersonation, and replay attacks. As such threats cannot be mitigated through traditional defense mechanisms due to the limitations posed by E-IoT, we propose LGuard ,<sep>Enterprise networks are becoming increasingly heterogeneous where enterprise devices and IoT devices coexist, requiring tools for effective management and security. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged in response to such needs of modern networks. SDN lacks adequate security features and Intrusion Detection and Protection Systems (IDPS) have been used to protect SDN from attacks. However, they have limited knowledge of zero day attacks. Machine Learning (ML) has become a valuable tool against these limitations and improve (SDN) network security. However, the solutions that solely rely on ML can struggle to discriminate benign traffic from malicious, and suffer from false negatives. To solve these problems and improve security of SDN-based enterprise networks, we propose S-Pot, an open-source smart honeypot framework.

However, many IoT applications are vulnerable to cyber attacks that can put networks, data, and connected devices at risk. Integrity measurement is an active defense technique used to detect malicious modification of software at runtime. While its usefulness has been well-demonstrated, integrity measurement is application-dependent and requires domain knowledge of the targeted software. Currently, adding integrity measurement to a platform requires substantial human effort, and thus application has been limited to usage on widely-deployed software such as the Linux kernel. Due to the diversity of IoT, vendors are unlikely to devote a substantial amount of effort to add integrity measurement systems to their devices.

The integration of sensors, lightweight computation, and the proliferation of different wireless technologies on IoT platforms enable human beings to easily interact with their surrounding physical world thoroughly. With the recent rise of IoT, several different IoT platforms have been introduced for researchers and developers to ease the management and control of various IoT devices. In general, the IoT platforms act as a bridge between core IoT functionalities and users by providing APIs. Due to their wide variety of applications, IoT platforms are mostly unique in their architectures and designs. Thus, IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) are challenged with substantial configuration differences in the proper configuration, implementation, and protection of the IoT solutions.

Details for each file can be found in the readme file or in the article's Supplementary Text.<sep>We conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment (EA) in a sample of ~3 million individuals and identify 3,952 approximately uncorrelated genome-wide-significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A genome-wide polygenic predictor, or polygenic index (PGI), explains 12-16% of EA variance and contributes to risk prediction for ten diseases. Direct effects (i.e., controlling for parental PGIs) explain roughly half the PGI's magnitude of association with EA and other phenotypes. The correlation between mate-pair PGIs is far too large to be consistent with phenotypic assortment alone, implying additional assortment on PGI-associated factors. In an additional GWAS of dominance deviations from the additive model, we identify no genome-wide-significant SNPs, and a separate X-chromosome additive GWAS identifies 57.<sep>Tobacco and alcohol use are leading causes of mortality that influence risk for many complex diseases and disorders1. They are heritable2,3 and etiologically related4,5 behaviors that have been resistant to gene discovery efforts6-11. In sample sizes up to 1.2 million individuals, we discovered 566 genetic variants in 406 loci associated with multiple stages of tobacco use (initiation, cessation, and heaviness) as well as alcohol use, with 150 loci evidencing pleiotropic association. Smoking phenotypes were positively genetically correlated with many health conditions, whereas alcohol use was negatively correlated with these conditions, such that increased genetic risk for alcohol use is associated with lower disease risk. We report evidence for the involvement of many systems in tobacco and alcohol use, including genes involved in nicotinic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. The results provide a solid starting point to evaluate the effects of these loci in model organisms and more precise substance use measures.<sep>Abstract White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are the most common brain-imaging feature of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), hypertension being the main known risk factor. Here, we identify 27 genome-wide loci for WMH-volume in a cohort of 50,970 older individuals, accounting for modification/confounding by hypertension. Aggregated WMH risk variants were associated with altered white matter integrity (p = 2.5×10-7) in brain images from 1,738 young healthy adults, providing insight into the lifetime impact of SVD genetic risk. Mendelian randomization suggested causal association of increasing WMH-volume with stroke, Alzheimer-type dementia, and of increasing blood pressure (BP) with larger WMH-volume, notably also in persons without clinical hypertension. Transcriptome-wide colocalization analyses showed association of WMH-volume with expression of 39 genes, of which four encode known drug targets. Finally, we provide insight into BP-independent biological pathways underlying SVD and suggest potential for genetic stratification of high-risk individuals and for genetically-informed prioritization of drug targets for prevention trials.<sep>Schools implementing Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) with fidelity demonstrate a wealth of student and school benefits. At the same time, there exists limited research from an inclusive innovation perspective: examining whether schools and communities have equitable access to PBIS based on sociodemographic school and community variables. This article presents the results of an ex post facto research design examining PBIS implementation and access across sociodemographic school and community variables from an inclusive innovation lens, examining data from schools ( N = 489) in the state of Georgia. The significant interaction effects revealed that between both PBIS and non-PBIS schools, those located in suburban areas had significantly higher median household incomes compared with rural and urban schools. Additional findings included the following: PBIS rural schools had higher household incomes and lower percentages of free/reduced-price lunch than non-PBIS schools in rural communities, and PBIS schools included significantly higher proportions of students who identified as White compared with non-PBIS schools.<sep>Identifying genetic determinants of reproductive success may highlight mechanisms underlying fertility and identify alleles under present-day selection. Using data in 785,604 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 43 genomic loci associated with either number of children ever born (NEB) or childlessness. These loci span diverse aspects of reproductive biology, including puberty timing, age at first birth, sex hormone regulation, endometriosis and age at menopause. Missense variants in ARHGAP27 were associated with higher NEB but shorter reproductive lifespan, suggesting a trade-off at this locus between reproductive ageing and intensity. Other genes implicated by coding variants include PIK3IP1, ZFP82 and LRP4, and our results suggest a new role for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in reproductive biology. As NEB is one component of evolutionary fitness, our identified associations indicate loci under present-day natural selection. Integration with data from historical selection scans highlighted an allele in the FADS1/2 gene locus that has been under selection for thousands of years and remains so today. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a broad range of biological mechanisms contribute to reproductive success.<sep>Age at first sexual intercourse and age at first birth have implications for health and evolutionary fitness. In this genome-wide association study (age at first sexual intercourse, N = 387,338; age at first birth, N = 542,901), we identify 371 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 11 sex-specific, with a 5-6% polygenic score prediction. Heritability of age at first birth shifted from 9% [CI = 4-14%] for women born in 1940 to 22% [CI = 19-25%] for those born in 1965. Signals are driven by the genetics of reproductive biology and externalising behaviour, with key genes related to follicle stimulating hormone (FSHB), implantation (ESR1), infertility and spermatid differentiation. Our findings suggest that polycystic ovarian syndrome may lead to later age at first birth, linking with infertility. Late age at first birth is associated with parental longevity and reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Higher childhood socioeconomic circumstances and those in the highest polygenic score decile (90%+) experience markedly later reproductive onset. Results are relevant for improving teenage and late-life health, understanding longevity and guiding experimentation into mechanisms of infertility.<sep>Abstract Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) inhibits inflammasome-mediated inflammation and has been proposed as a treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 (NCT04381936, ISRCTN50189673). In this assessment of DMF performed at 27 UK hospitals, adults were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus DMF. The primary outcome was clinical status on day 5 measured on a seven-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were time to sustained improvement in clinical status, time to discharge, day 5 peripheral blood oxygenation, day 5 C-reactive protein, and improvement in day 10 clinical status. Between 2 March 2021 and 18 November 2021, 713 patients were enroled in the DMF evaluation, of whom 356 were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus DMF, and 357 to usual care alone. 95% of patients received corticosteroids as part of routine care. There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of DMF on clinical status at day 5 (common odds ratio of unfavourable outcome 1.12; 95% CI 0.86-1.47; p = 0.40). There was no significant effect of DMF on any secondary outcome.<sep>Abstract We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of relative intake from the macronutrients fat, protein, carbohydrates, and sugar in over 235,000 individuals of European ancestries. We identified 21 unique, approximately independent lead SNPs. Fourteen lead SNPs are uniquely associated with one macronutrient at genome-wide significance ( P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 ), while five of the 21 lead SNPs reach suggestive significance ( P &lt; 1 × 10 −5 ) for at least one other macronutrient. While the phenotypes are genetically correlated, each phenotype carries a partially unique genetic architecture. Relative protein intake exhibits the strongest relationships with poor health, including positive genetic associations with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease ( r g ≈ 0.15–0.5). In contrast, relative carbohydrate and sugar intake have negative genetic correlations with waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and neighborhood deprivation (| r g | ≈ 0.1–0.3) and positive genetic correlations with physical activity ( r g ≈ 0.1 and 0.2). Relative fat intake has no consistent pattern of genetic correlations with poor health but has a negative genetic correlation with educational attainment ( r g ≈−0.1). Although our analyses do not allow us to draw causal conclusions, we find no evidence of negative health consequences associated with relative carbohydrate, sugar, or fat intake. However, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that relative protein intake plays a role in the etiology of metabolic dysfunction.<sep>Glycosuria is a condition where glucose is detected in urine at higher concentrations than normal (i.e. not detectable). Glycosuria at some point during pregnancy has an estimated prevalence of 50% and is associated with adverse outcomes in both mothers and offspring. Little is currently known about the genetic contribution to this trait or the extent to which it overlaps with other seemingly related traits, e.g. diabetes. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for self-reported glycosuria in pregnant mothers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (cases/controls = 1249/5140). We identified two loci, one of which (lead SNP = rs13337037; chromosome 16; odds ratio of glycosuria per effect allele: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.56; P = 1.97 × 10-13) was then validated using an obstetric measure of glycosuria measured in the same cohort (227/6639). We performed a secondary GWAS in the 1986 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1986; 747/2991) using midwife-reported glycosuria and offspring genotype as a proxy for maternal genotype. The combined results revealed evidence for a consistent effect on glycosuria at the chromosome 16 locus. In follow-up analyses, we saw little evidence of shared genetic underpinnings with the exception of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (Rg = 0.64; SE = 0.22; P = 0.0042), a biomarker of kidney disease. In conclusion, we identified a genetic association with self-reported glycosuria during pregnancy, with the lead SNP located 15kB upstream of SLC5A2, a target of antidiabetic drugs. The lack of strong genetic correlation with seemingly related traits such as type 2 diabetes suggests different genetic risk factors exist for glycosuria during pregnancy.<sep>Background: Recently, common genetic risk factors for intracranial aneurysm (IA) and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (ASAH) were found to explain a large amount of disease heritability and therefore have potential to be used for genetic risk prediction. We constructed a genetic risk score to (1) predict ASAH incidence and IA presence (combined set of unruptured IA and ASAH) and (2) assess its association with patient characteristics. Methods: A genetic risk score incorporating genetic association data for IA and 17 traits related to IA (so-called metaGRS) was created using 1161 IA cases and 407 392 controls from the UK Biobank population study. The metaGRS was validated in combination with risk factors blood pressure, sex, and smoking in 828 IA cases and 68 568 controls from the Nordic HUNT population study. Furthermore, we assessed association between the metaGRS and patient characteristics in a cohort of 5560 IA patients. Results: Per SD increase of metaGRS, the hazard ratio for ASAH incidence was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.20–1.51) and the odds ratio for IA presence 1.09 (95% CI, 1.01–1.18). Upon including the metaGRS on top of clinical risk factors, the concordance index to predict ASAH hazard increased from 0.63 (95% CI, 0.59–0.67) to 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62–0.69), while prediction of IA presence did not improve. The metaGRS was statistically significantly associated with age at ASAH (β=−4.82×10 −3 per year [95% CI, −6.49×10 −3 to −3.14×10 −3 ]; P =1.82×10 −8 ), and location of IA at the internal carotid artery (odds ratio=0.92 [95% CI, 0.86–0.98]; P =0.0041). Conclusions: The metaGRS was predictive of ASAH incidence, although with limited added value over clinical risk factors. The metaGRS was not predictive of IA presence. Therefore, we do not recommend using this metaGRS in daily clinical care. Genetic risk does partly explain the clinical heterogeneity of IA warranting prioritization of clinical heterogeneity in future genetic prediction studies of IA and ASAH.<sep>To assess whether migraine may be genetically and/or causally associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or celiac disease.Migraine has been linked to IBD and celiac disease in observational studies, but whether this link may be explained by a shared genetic basis or could be causal has not been established. The presence of a causal association could be clinically relevant, as treating one of these medical conditions might mitigate the symptoms of a causally linked condition.Linkage disequilibrium score regression and two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses were performed using summary statistics from cohort-based genome-wide association studies of migraine (59,674 cases; 316,078 controls), IBD (25,042 cases; 34,915 controls) and celiac disease (11,812 or 4533 cases; 11,837 or 10,750 controls). Migraine with and without aura were analyzed separately, as were the two IBD subtypes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Positive control analyses and conventional Mendelian randomization sensitivity analyses were performed.Migraine was not genetically correlated with IBD or celiac disease. No evidence was observed for IBD (odds ratio [OR] 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.02, p = 0.703) or celiac disease (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.02, p = 0.912) causing migraine or migraine causing either IBD (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96-1.22, p = 0.181) or celiac disease (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.79-1.48, p = 0.614) when all participants with migraine were analyzed jointly. There was some indication of a causal association between celiac disease and migraine with aura (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, p = 0.045), between celiac disease and migraine without aura (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p = 0.006), as well as between migraine without aura and ulcerative colitis (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29, p = 0.025). However, the results were not significant after multiple testing correction.We found no evidence of a shared genetic basis or of a causal association between migraine and either IBD or celiac disease, although we obtained some indications of causal associations with migraine subtypes.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Ex vivo<sep>Amino acid<sep>In vivo<sep>Vertebrate<sep>Troponin<sep>Adaptation (eye)<sep>Immunohistochemistry<sep>DNA methylation<sep>Troponin I<sep>Ectotherm<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Arginine<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Viability assay<sep>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy<sep>Abiotic component<sep>Temozolomide<sep>Methyltransferase<sep>Methylation<sep>Biomarker<sep>RNA splicing</keyword><title>Arginine methylation: the promise of a ‘silver bullet’ for brain tumours?<sep>The inhibitory subunit of cardiac troponin (cTnI) is modified by arginine methylation in the human heart<sep>Hull’s Magic Box: Keeping Brain Tumour Biopsies “Alive” in the Lab Brings Research Opportunities for New Therapies and Earlier Diagnosis of Brain Tumour<sep>HULL’S MAGIC BOX: BUILDING THE CASE FOR CLINICAL TRIALS USING ARGININE METHYLATION INHIBITORS AGAINST GBM<sep>Functional genomics of abiotic environmental adaptation in lacertid lizards and other vertebrates</title><abstract>Despite intense research efforts, our pharmaceutical repertoire against high-grade brain tumours has not been able to increase patient survival for a decade and life expectancy remains at less than 16 months after diagnosis, on average. Inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) have been developed and investigated over the past 15 years and have now entered oncology clinical trials, including for brain tumours. This review collates recent advances in the understanding of the role of PRMTs and arginine methylation in brain tumours. We provide an up-to-date literature review on the mechanisms for PRMT regulation. These include endogenous modulators such as alternative splicing, miRNA, post-translational modifications and PRMT-protein interactions, and synthetic inhibitors. We discuss the relevance of PRMTs in brain tumours with a particular focus on PRMT1, -2, -5 and -8. Finally, we include a future perspective where we discuss possible routes for further research on arginine methylation and on the use of PRMT inhibitors in the context of brain tumours.<sep>The inhibitory subunit of cardiac troponin (cTnI) is a gold standard cardiac biomarker and also an essential protein in cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction coupling. The interactions of cTnI with other proteins are fine-tuned by post-translational modification of cTnI. Mutations in cTnI can lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Here we report, for the first time, that cTnI is modified by arginine methylation in human myocardium. Using Western blot, we observed reduced levels of cTnI arginine methylation in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to dilated cardiomyopathy biopsies. Similarly, using a rat model of cardiac hypertrophy we observed reduced levels of cTnI arginine methylation compared to sham controls. Using mass spectrometry, we identified cTnI methylation sites at R74/R79 and R146/R148 in human cardiac samples. R146 and R148 lie at the boundary between the critical cTnI inhibitory and switch peptides; PRMT1 methylated an extended inhibitory peptide at R146 and R148 in vitro. Mutations at R145 that have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hampered R146/R148 methylation by PRMT1 in vitro. H9c2 cardiac-like cells transfected with plasmids encoding for a methylation-deficient R146A/R148A cTnI protein developed cell hypertrophy, with a 32% increase in cell size after 72 h, compared to control cells.Our results provide evidence for a novel and significant cTnI post-translational modification. Our work opens the door to translational investigations of cTnI arginine methylation as a biomarker of disease, which can include e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocardial infarction and heart failure, and offers a novel way to investigate the effect of cTnI mutations in the inhibitory/switch peptides.<sep>Abstract AIMS Assess/evaluate apoptosis in GBM samples maintained on a microfluidics system in response to GSK3368715 and other PRMT inhibitors, currently in clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of synergising with personalised patient care and precision medicine. Investigate the effect of treating GBM biopsies on-chip with PRMT inhibitors at the molecular level, including RNA and protein modifications. METHOD GBM biopsies are received from Hull Royal Infirmary and maintained on-chip for 8-days. They are perfused with media, at a rate of 3 μl/min, mimicking the in vivo environment and allowing real-time analysis of tumour behaviour. PRMT inhibitors, such as GSK3368715, are added to the media, in conjunction with TMZ, to determine their efficacy ex vivo using a range of techniques, such as: immunohistochemistry, cell viability assays, protein analysis and RNA-sequencing. RESULTS We show that PRMT inhibition increases apoptosis five-fold above the control, untreated GBM-on-chip samples. This is compounded by cell viability assays, which have indicated that cell viability in these post-chip tissues is reduced by 30% upon treatment with 1μM GSK3368715. Additionally, western blot analysis has indicated that PRMT inhibition with GSK3368715 appears to switch the methylation status of fused-in-sarcoma (FUS) protein in GBM biopsies. CONCLUSION These results indicate that PRMT inhibition may not only be a viable target for GBM therapy, but could also highlight a mechanism for re-sensitising MGMT-negative GBM to TMZ. This data produces an exciting argument for further research into the use of this novel inhibitor for improving prognosis for patients diagnosed with this devastating disease.<sep>Abstract AIMS • Assess/evaluate transcriptomic changes in GBM, maintained on a microfluidics system, in response to treatment with arginine methylation inhibitor GSK3368715, currently in clinical trials, to identify novel therapeutic strategies, synergising with personalised patient care and precision medicine • Investigate molecular differences between healthy brain and GBM maintained on-chip in response to GSK3368715, including proliferation, apoptosis and splicing. METHOD GBM biopsies from Hull Royal Infirmary, or healthy mouse brain tissues, were maintained on-chip for 8- days and perfused with GSK3368715-treated media, at 3 μl/min, mimicking the in vivo environment. RNA- sequencing determined thousands of differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing (AS) events resulting from GSK3368715 treatment. Immunohistochemistry displayed the effect of GSK3368715 on healthy mouse brain tissue to ascertain the specificity of the arginine methylation inhibitor in leading to GBM apoptosis. RESULTS RNA-sequencing showed highly significant GO-term-enrichment in ribosome and translation pathways, suggesting decreased protein synthesis capacity after GSK3368715 treatment. Additionally, several hundreds of genes were found to be undergoing AS, compatible with a mechanism where changes in the arginine methylation pattern of spliceosome member FUS, upon GSK3368715 treatment, contribute to AS. Of these events, 136 (more than expected by chance, χ2 = 7.16, p = 0.007) were known FUS splicing targets. GO-term-enrichment of these AS events was found in DNA damage and cell death . Together these results are consistent with immunohistological findings that GSK3368715 causes apoptosis in GBM-on-chip tissue, in a specific manner. CONCLUSIONS Our results highlight an exciting potential therapeutic target for GBM, via induction of alternative splicing path- ways, through arginine methylation inhibition with GSK3368715.<sep>Understanding the genomic basis of adaptation to different abiotic environments is important in the context of climate change and resulting short-term environmental fluctuations. Using functional and comparative genomics approaches, we here investigated whether signatures of genomic adaptation to a set of environmental parameters are concentrated in specific subsets of genes and functions in lacertid lizards and other vertebrates. We first identify 200 genes with signatures of positive diversifying selection from transcriptomes of 24 species of lacertid lizards and demonstrate their involvement in physiological and morphological adaptations to climate. To understand how functionally similar these genes are to previously predicted candidate functions for climate adaptation and to compare them with other vertebrate species, we then performed a meta-analysis of 1,100 genes under selection obtained from -omics studies in vertebrate species adapted to different abiotic factors. We found that the vertebrate gene set formed a tightly connected interactome, which was to 23% enriched in previously predicted functions of adaptation to climate, and to a large part (18%) involved in organismal stress response. We found a much higher degree of identical genes being repeatedly selected among different animal groups (43.6%), and of functional similarity and post-translational modifications than expected by chance, and no clear functional division between genes used for ectotherm and endotherm physiological strategies. In total, 171 out of 200 genes of Lacertidae were part of this network. These results highlight an important role of a comparatively small set of genes and their functions in environmental adaptation and narrow the set of candidate pathways and markers to be used in future research on adaptation and stress response related to climate change.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/161333/lecturer-senior-lecturer-reader-professor-in-production-animal-welfare-science/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5086306685", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5033341479", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on genetic associations and disease etiology, which is not directly aligned with the job's focus on animal welfare and behavior in livestock.

Here, we present version 4 of pcadapt which substantially improves computational efficiency while providing similar results. This improvement is made possible by using a different format for storing genotypes and a different algorithm for computing principal components of the genotype matrix, which is the most computationally demanding step in method pcadapt. These changes are seamlessly integrated into the existing pcadapt package, and users will experience a large reduction in computation time (by a factor of 20–60 in our analyses) as compared with previous versions.<sep>ABSTRACT Motivation Principal component analysis (PCA) of genetic data is routinely used to infer ancestry and control for population structure in various genetic analyses. However, conducting PCA analyses can be complicated and has several potential pitfalls. These pitfalls include (i) capturing linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure instead of population structure, (ii) projected PCs that suffer from shrinkage bias, (iii) detecting sample outliers and (iv) uneven population sizes. In this work, we explore these potential issues when using PCA, and present efficient solutions to these. Following applications to the UK Biobank and the 1000 Genomes project datasets, we make recommendations for best practices and provide efficient and user-friendly implementations of the proposed solutions in R packages bigsnpr and bigutilsr. Results For example, we find that PC19–PC40 in the UK Biobank capture complex LD structure rather than population structure. Using our automatic algorithm for removing long-range LD regions, we recover 16 PCs that capture population structure only. Therefore, we recommend using only 16–18 PCs from the UK Biobank to account for population structure confounding. We also show how to use PCA to restrict analyses to individuals of homogeneous ancestry. Finally, when projecting individual genotypes onto the PCA computed from the 1000 Genomes project data, we find a shrinkage bias that becomes large for PC5 and beyond. We then demonstrate how to obtain unbiased projections efficiently using bigsnpr. Overall, we believe this work would be of interest for anyone using PCA in their analyses of genetic data, as well as for other omics data. Availability and implementation R packages bigsnpr and bigutilsr can be installed from either CRAN or GitHub (see https://github.com/privefl/bigsnpr).

SSRIs are commonly found in surface waters in populated areas across the globe. They exert their effect by blocking the serotonin re-uptake transporter in the presynaptic nerve ending. The present study examined whether behavioural effects to exposure to SSRI citalopram depend on personality and sex in the stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ). Three aspects of stickleback behaviour are examined: feeding behaviour, aggression, and boldness. We exposed sticklebacks to 350–380 ng/l citalopram for 3 weeks. Feeding and aggressive behaviour were recorded before and after exposure, whereas scototaxis behaviour was tested after exposure. The results show treatment effects in feeding and aggressive behaviour. Feeding is suppressed only in the male group ( χ 2 = 20.4, P &lt; 0.001) but not in the females ( χ 2 = 0.91, P = 0.339). Aggressive behaviour was significantly affected by treatment ( χ 2 = 161.9, P &lt; 0.001), sex ( χ 2 = 86.3, P &lt; 0.001), and baseline value ( χ 2 = 58.8, P &lt; 0.001). Aggressiveness was suppressed by citalopram treatment. In addition, the fish showed no change in aggression and feeding behaviour over time regardless of sex and treatment, which indicate personality traits. Only females are affected by treatment in the scototaxis test. The exposed females spent significantly ( χ 2 = 5.02, P = 0.050) less time in the white zone than the female controls.<sep>Pharmaceuticals are emerging as environmentally problematic compounds. As they are often not appropriately removed by sewage treatment plants, pharmaceutical compounds end up in surface water environments worldwide at concentrations in the ng to μg L−1 range. There is a need to further explore single compound and mixture effects using e.g. in vivo test model systems. We have investigated, for the first time, behavioral effects in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to a binary mixture of an antidepressant drug (citalopram) and a synthetic opioid (tramadol). Citalopram and tramadol have a similar mode of action (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and are known to produce drug-drug interactional effects resulting in serotonin syndrome (SS) in humans. Zebrafish embryo-larvae were exposed to citalopram, tramadol and 1:1 binary mixture from fertilization until 144 h post-fertilization. No effects on heart rate, spontaneous tail coiling, or death/malformations were observed in any treatment at tested concentrations. Behavior (hypoactivity in dark periods) was on the other hand affected, with lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 373 μg L−1 for citalopram, 320 μg L−1 for tramadol, and 473 μg L−1 for the 1:1 mixture. Behavioral EC50 was calculated to be 471 μg L−1 for citalopram, 411 μg L−1 for tramadol, and 713 μg L−1 for the 1:1 mixture. The results of this study conclude that tramadol and citalopram produce hypoactivity in 144 hpf zebrafish larvae. Further, a 1:1 binary mixture of the two caused the same response, albeit at a higher concentration, possibly due to SS.<sep>The synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and commonly detected in sewage effluents, interferes with the endocrine system in multiple ways. Exposure during sensitive windows of development causes persistent effects on fertility, reproductive and non-reproductive behavior in mammals and fish. In the present study, three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were exposed to nominal 0 and 20 ng/L EE2 from fertilization to 7 weeks post-hatch. After 8 months of remediation in clean water three non-reproductive behaviors, not previously analyzed in developmentally EE2-exposed progeny of wild-caught fish, were evaluated. Chemical analysis revealed that the nominal 0 and 20 ng/L exposure contained 5 and 30 ng/L EE2, respectively. Therefore, the use of control fish from previous experiments was necessary for comparisons. Fish exposed during development showed significant concentration-dependent reduction in anxiety-like behavior in the scototaxis (light/dark preference) test by means of shorter latency to first entrance to the white compartment, more visits in white, and longer total time in white compared to unexposed fish. In the novel tank test, developmental exposure significantly increased the number of transitions to the upper half of the aquaria. Exposure to EE2 during development did not alter shoal cohesion in the shoaling test compared with unexposed fish but fish exposed to 30 ng/L EE2 had significantly longer latency to leave the shoal and fewer transitions away from the shoal compared to fish exposed to 5 ng/L EE2. Skewed sex ratio with more females, sex reversal in genetic males as well as intersex in males was observed after exposure to 30, but not 5 ng/L EE2. In conclusion, EE2 exposure during development in three-spined stickleback resulted in persistent effects on anxiety-like behaviors. These long-term effects from developmental exposure are likely to be of higher relevance for natural populations than are short-term effects from adult exposure.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/294786/post-doc-in-salmonid-fish-ecological-and-evolutionary-genetics-and-or-functional-genetics/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5039794476", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5088575257", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in computational genetics and population genomics, which aligns well with the quantitative genetics and data analysis aspects of the job description.

These however, do not allow intuitive tuning to customize gait to users' preferences. When persons walk on their own, they balance a variety of needs such as speed, comfort, and energy. Providing user tuning by optimizing between different gait performance measures gives an intuitive flexibility. We have shown the optimization between natural walking and gait energy produces stable bipedal gait through simulation in a virtual constraint framework. This verification shows validity of the methodology and framework for improving tuning and customization of assistive exoskeletons.<sep>The integration of fluctuating renewable resources such as wind and solar into existing power systems poses challenges to grid reliability and the seamless incorporation of these resources. To address the inherent variability in renewable generation, direct load control emerges as a promising method for demand-side management. Thermostatically controlled appliances, like air conditioners, hold a significant role in this approach. However, effective direct load control necessitates accurate load magnitude estimation and the potential for load shifting. In this paper, we introduce a smart-agent architecture that employs a mathematical model to forecast aggregated power consumption behavior, even when changes are introduced by the controller. To assess system performance, a numerical simulator was developed, demonstrating the system’s adaptability to changes, its self-retraining capability, and its continuous improvement in predicting aggregated power consumption.<sep>This paper proposed a methodology to automatically search for the best combination of the Learning Horizon (LH) and Predicting Horizon (PH) with the objective of improving the prediction performance for a temperature prediction technique for HVAC units.

The developed temperature prediction technique was tested, validated, and evaluated in a case study. This case study also compared the prediction performances of the three different optimization algorithms mentioned earlier and explored the impact of the LHs and PHs on the prediction performance. By setting up the selection standards for evaluating the prediction performances of the temperature prediction technique, the most suitable algorithm was then selected along with the best combination of the LH and PH.<sep>Integrating renewable resources such as wind and solar into the existing power system has introduced new challenges due to their rapid fluctuations which tends to decrease the reliability of the grid. One method to cope with this uncertainty and variability in generation is managing the demand side through direct load control. Thermostatically controlled appliances can play a significant role for this purpose; however, the system operator requires a reliable estimation about the magnitude of the load and how much it can be shifted. This paper presents a methodology to formulate and forecast the control capacity of a population of thermostatically controlled appliances. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using a numerical simulator of a population of the loads. Simulation results show that the proposed model can provide a robust estimation about controllability of the load in terms of minimum and maximum achievable load and the time interval that it can hold the load at certain level.<sep>One of the challenges of integrating renewable resources such as wind and solar energy into the existing electric power system is their rapid fluctuations that tends to decrease the reliability of the grid. Direct load control is one method to mitigate this variability and thermostatically controlled appliances such as air conditioners can play a significant role due to their large share to the total load. However, the system operator requires a reliable estimation about the magnitude of this load and how much it can be shifted. This paper presents a model-based forecasting method to provide a short-term load forecast of the controllable load. The main benefits of this method are 1) using real-time measurements to build a model of system; therefore, there is no need for a large historical measurements nor physical parameters, 2) fast response to the sudden changes in the system parameters. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a numerical simulator that shows it can generate forecasts with less than 6% error.<sep>Grid Forming (GFM) Inverters have gained attraction recently in grid applications due mainly to their unparallel capability of supporting power system operation. The Virtual Oscillator Control (VOC) method is one of the methods for the operation and power regulation of GFM inverters. This type of controller is realized in the time domain based on the nonlinear dynamics of the oscillator and designed based on a specific set point that needs modifications to regulate the output voltage of the inverter and tracks active and reactive power reference signals. Voltage regulation of VOC grid-forming inverter based on an Andronov-Hopf oscillator with adaptive oscillation magnitude and single-phase system is studied in this paper. The proposed adaptive dynamic utilizes the direct relation between the reactive power error and nominal magnitude of oscillation which provides better tracking performance for inverter reactive power. Then a linearized model of the closed-loop system is analyzed for the stability region of the controller parameter. Ultimately, the proposed method’s operation is evaluated and validated by numerical simulations for different conditions.<sep>Wind and Solar farms are rapidly growing to produce electricity as sustainable resources; however, integrating these renewable resources into the existing power system has introduced new challenges due to their rapid fluctuations. These fast varying generation tends to decrease the reliability of the grid. Managing the demand side is one method to cope with this uncertainty and variability in generation. Direct load control of the thermostatically controlled appliances such as air conditioners and electric water heaters can play a significant role for this purpose. This paper presents a control schema for the demand-side management that informs the system operator about the future load and its capacity to increase or decrease it. Therefore, the system operator will have a reliable estimation about the magnitude of the control capacity in the future to create attainable dispatch command. The schema is based on a Mathematical model of the aggregated load combined with a simple PID controller. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using MATLAB simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed model can provide a fast response (within a minute) to the dispatch commands.<sep>Integrating renewable resources, such as wind and solar into the existing power system, has introduced new challenges due to their rapid fluctuations, which tends to decrease the reliability of the grid. One method to cope with this uncertainty and variability in generation is managing the demand side through direct load control. Thermostatically controlled appliances can play a significant role for this purpose; however, the system operator requires a reliable estimation about the magnitude of the load and how much it can be shifted. This article presents a novel methodology to formulate and forecast the control capacity of a population of thermostatically controlled appliances. In addition to that, this methodology can provide an estimation on how long the system can follow a desired level of power consumption and how the aggregated load would change once the controller stops (i.e., the payback). The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a numerical simulator of a population of the loads. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide a reliable estimation about controllability of the load in terms of minimum and maximum achievable load, the time interval that it can hold the load at a certain level, and how the uncontrolled load would behave after the control period.<sep>Integrating renewable resources such as wind and solar into the electric power systems introduces new challenges to the grid due to fast fluctuations which reduces the reliability of the system. Demand side management (DSM) is one method to cope with the uncertainty and variability of the generation. Direct load control of thermostatically controlled appliances can play a significant role for this purpose; however, the system operator requires a reliable estimation about the magnitude of the load and how much it can be shifted, in order to produce attainable desired aggregated load. The focus of this paper is on designing a model-free controller to follow the system operator's dispatch instructions. The main advantage of such controller is to eliminate the requirement for training or identifying the controllable loads' parameters; thus, it can be used as a plug & play component. The other advantage is that this system can dynamically cope with system changes. In this research, the controller changes the thermostat set points of the individual loads in a systematically manner so that the aggregated power consumptions of the loads would follow the desired aggregated load. To evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, a numerical simulator was developed, and the controller was applied over the simulation engine to follow arbitrary desired power profiles. It was observed that the system can follow the dispatch command in less than 10 minutes with a negligible steady state error (less than 5%).<sep>The use of exoskeletons for clinical lower-limb stroke rehabilitation offers the potential of improved and customized rehabilitation that reduces the requirements and demands placed on multiple staff members. Initial research with lower-limb exoskeletons show potential to alleviate this problem. Conventional assistance-based exoskeleton devices simply enforce the desired gait trajectory for the patient in order to ensure safety and stability. Unfortunately, if the end-user does not have to work to contribute to successful motion, rehabilitation often does not occur. Recent evidence has suggested that assistance-as-needed control prevents users from slacking, facilitating functional motor recovery. Assistance-as-needed control turns off assistive torques during periods when the patient is able to execute a desired gait pattern but if the patients gait deviates sufficiently from a desired trajectory then assistive torques are generated to compensate for the patients loss of strength. This strategy encourages the patient to contribute effort while still enabling the exoskeleton to guide movements. Assistance-as-needed control inherently leads to aperiodic gait patterns and has accordingly been difficult to employ in lower-limb exoskeletons due to the need to ensure stability. This work demonstrates how virtual constraint control-a method with robust stability properties used in prostheses and assistive exoskeletons control-can be combined with a velocity-modulated deadzone to ensure stability. Simulations suggest that the method can accommodate a large deadzone while remaining stable across a range of unanticipated gait pathologies, as demonstrated using Lorenz mappings that can accommodate the aperiodic nature of the resulting gait.<sep>With high penetration of renewable resources such as wind and solar into conventional electric grid, new challenges are introduced due to the rapid fluctuation on the generation side. Direct load control of thermostatically controlled loads can play a significant role in demand side management (DSM) to cope with the uncertainties and variabilities of the generation. For this purpose, the system operator (SO) requires a reliable forecast of the demand and how much it can be shifted; in order to produce attainable desirable set points to reshape the demand to follow generation side. The focus of this paper is on designing a smart agent that uses a hybrid system of a model-based and a model-free structure to forecast the controllable load and its capacity to be reshaped, and follow the dispatch instructions of the SO, while minimizing the payback effect of the control actions and maintaining customers’ comfort. The main advantages of the proposed system are: 1) real-time model creation; thus, no need for historical data for training, 2) model free controller can automatically adapt to the changes in the system, 3) it can be used as a plug & play component in a DSM program. To evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, a numerical simulator was developed, and the controller was applied over the simulation engine to follow arbitrary desired power profiles. It was observed that the system can follow the dispatch command in less than 5 minutes with a negligible steady state error (less than 5%).</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Ćuk converter<sep>Ripple<sep>Duty cycle<sep>Voltage doubler<sep>Buck–boost converter<sep>Forward converter<sep>Boost converter<sep>Flyback converter<sep>Voltage</keyword><title>A Fuzzy-Controlled High Voltage Gain DC–DC Converter for Renewable Applications<sep>Disturbance Analysis and Implementation of High Voltage Gain Non-Isolated DC-DC Converter for Renewable Applications<sep>A Fuzzy controlled high gain DC–DC converter for renewable power generation<sep>Implementation of high‐gain nonisolated DC‐DC converter for PV‐fed applications<sep>Design and implementation of modified multilevel sepic converter for PV based apllications</title><abstract>In this manuscript, a non-isolated converter with high static voltage gain is presented.

The proposed converter has the feature of stable frequency and stable output voltage. It also achieves high voltage conversion, high efficiency, low voltage stress and less switching loss. The v oltage tripler technique is implemented in the proposed model. The designed converter model attains high static gain with reduced duty cycle. The proposed single switch converter is controlled by fuzzy-PI controlled technique. The working process of the converter under Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) is explained. The 30 V input source is boosted up to 400 V. The simulation of the presented converter is done with MATLAB simulink. The hardware prototype is also tested and results are analysed.<sep>A unique nonisolated converter using solar source as input is depicted in this paper. The presented design is an amalgamation of SEPIC converter and voltage tripler structure to attain high static gain voltage. The converter operates by solitary switch, and the voltage strain is less. The input current is continuous, and hence, huge filters are not utilized. Henceforth, the proposed converter is suitable for renewable application. The presented converter is associated to the PV source input and DC load source. The hardware sample of the presented converter along with the PV simulator is tested under laboratory. The prototype of a 30-V input source to 400-V source output developed 400 W, and the performance of the designed topology is evaluated. The theoretical and hardware results accomplish that this converter is apt for high-voltage solicitations.<sep>In this manuscript, a DC-DC converter of modified multilevel sepic model with single switch is proposed here. The designed converter combines the voltage tripler circuit, which improves the voltage gain and reduces the voltage ripple of the system. Another feature of the designed converter is reduces the voltage stress and utilized for PV based applications. The operation of the designed converter in Continuous-Conduction Mode (CCM) is discussed. The converter boosts the PV input voltage of 30 V to 400 V output voltages. The efficiency attained by the designed converter is 94%. The Theoretical analysis of the designed converter is presented and it is done with MATLAB simulink.

We report here an extremely rare incident of P. acnes tibial osteomyelitis at the IO access site, in a 4-year-old child, who presented 3 months after an episode of fluid resuscitation for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome necessitating irrigation and debridement and prolonged antibiotic therapy. We advocate for heightened awareness of osteomyelitis in patients with continued pain after IO cannulation. Low-grade persistent symptoms may be caused by less virulent organisms and may dictate need for early magnetic resonance imaging studies for diagnosis and treatment planning.<sep>Certain facial parts are salient (unique) in appearance, which substantially contribute to the holistic recognition of a subject. Occlusion of these salient parts deteriorates the performance of face recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose a generative model to reconstruct the missing parts of the face which are under occlusion. The proposed generative model (SD-GAN) reconstructs a face preserving the illumination variation and identity of the face. A novel adversarial training algorithm has been designed for a bimodal mutually exclusive Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, for faster convergence. A novel adversarial structural loss function is also proposed, comprising of two components: a holistic and a local loss, characterized by SSIM and patch-wise MSE. Ablation studies on real and synthetically occluded face datasets reveal that our proposed technique outperforms the competing methods by a considerable margin, even for boosting the performance of Face Recognition.<sep>Pose-Invariant Face Recognition (PIFR) has been a serious challenge in the general field of face recognition (FR). The performance of face recognition algorithms deteriorate due to various degradations such as pose, illuminaton, occlusions, blur, noise, aliasing, etc. In this paper, we deal with the problem of 3D pose variation of a face. for that we design and propose PosIX Generative Adversarial Network (PosIX-GAN) that has been trained to generate a set of nice (high quality) face images with 9 different pose variations, when provided with a face image in any arbitrary pose as input. The discriminator of the GAN has also been trained to perform the task of face recognition along with the job of discriminating between real and generated (fake) images. Results when evaluated using two benchmark datasets, reveal the superior performance of PosIX-GAN over state-of-the-art shallow as well as deep learning methods.<sep>Introduction: Historically, patients with rotator cuff arthropathy had limited reconstructive options. The early generations of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) designs had increased failure rates due to loosening of glenoid baseplates secondary to excessive torques. In 1985, Paul Grammont introduced a prosthetic design changing the center of rotation that addressed this major complication. The Grammont principles remain the foundation of modern reverse total shoulder prostheses, although the original design has undergone several adaptations. We reviewed here the various aspects of prosthetic designs including baseplates, glenospheres, humeral components, and polyethylene bearing interfaces.Areas covered: We discuss the evolution, biomechanics, prosthetic options, and future direction for rTSA. A literature search using the PubMed database including review articles, biomechanical studies, and clinical trials pertaining to rTSA prothesis and outcomes.Expert commentary: Despite an expansion in the understanding of the biomechanics of the rotator cuff deficient shoulder and its effect on the reverse total shoulder prostheses, Grammont principles remain the foundation of contemporary rTSA designs. Further clinical studies are needed to assess how modern prosthetic modifications effect clinical and radiographic outcomes. Additionally, implants are being used in younger individuals with expanded indications, therefore, close clinical monitoring is needed to better evaluate their prosthetic longevity.<sep>Characterizing cellular diversity at different levels of biological organization and across data modalities is a prerequisite to understanding the function of cell types in the brain. Classification of neurons is also essential to manipulate cell types in controlled ways and to understand their variation and vulnerability in brain disorders. The BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) is an integrated network of data-generating centers, data archives, and data standards developers, with the goal of systematic multimodal brain cell type profiling and characterization. Emphasis of the BICCN is on the whole mouse brain with demonstration of prototype feasibility for human and nonhuman primate (NHP) brains. Here, we provide a guide to the cellular and spatial approaches employed by the BICCN, and to accessing and using these data and extensive resources, including the BRAIN Cell Data Center (BCDC), which serves to manage and integrate data across the ecosystem. We illustrate the power of the BICCN data ecosystem through vignettes highlighting several BICCN analysis and visualization tools. Finally, we present emerging standards that have been developed or adopted toward Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) neuroscience. The combined BICCN ecosystem provides a comprehensive resource for the exploration and analysis of cell types in the brain.<sep>Neuroscientific data analysis has traditionally relied on linear algebra and stochastic process theory. However, the tree-like shapes of neurons cannot be described easily as points in a vector space (the subtraction of two neuronal shapes is not a meaningful operation), and methods from computational topology are better suited to their analysis. Here we introduce methods from Discrete Morse (DM) Theory to extract the tree-skeletons of individual neurons from volumetric brain image data, and to summarize collections of neurons labelled by tracer injections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is sensible to summarize the collection of neurons using a consensus tree-shape that provides a richer information summary than the traditional regional ‘connectivity matrix’ approach. The conceptually elegant DM approach lacks hand-tuned parameters and captures global properties of the data as opposed to previous approaches which are inherently local. For individual skeletonization of sparsely labelled neurons we obtain substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art non-topological methods (over 10% improvements in precision and faster proofreading). The consensus-tree summary of tracer injections incorporates the regional connectivity matrix information, but in addition captures the collective collateral branching patterns of the set of neurons connected to the injection site, and provides a bridge between single-neuron morphology and tracer-injection data.<sep>Neuroscientific data analysis has traditionally relied on linear algebra and stochastic process theory.

With recent developments in imaging and digitization, this approach is no longer feasible with the large scale (terabyte to petabyte range) images. Machine learning based techniques, using deep networks, provide an efficient alternative to the problem. However, these methods rely on very large volumes of annotated images for training and have error rates that are too high for scientific data analysis, and thus requires a significant volume of human-in-the-loop proofreading. Here we introduce a hybrid architecture combining prior structure in the form of topological data analysis methods, based on discrete Morse theory, with the best-in-class deep-net architectures for the neuronal connectivity analysis. We show significant performance gains using our hybrid architecture on detection of topological structure (e.g. connectivity of neuronal processes and local intensity maxima on axons corresponding to synaptic swellings) with precision/recall close to 90% compared with human observers. We have adapted our architecture to a high performance pipeline capable of semantic segmentation of light microscopic whole-brain image data into a hierarchy of neuronal compartments. We expect that the hybrid architecture incorporating discrete Morse techniques into deep nets will generalize to other data domains.<sep>Understanding of neuronal circuitry at cellular resolution within the brain has relied on tract tracing methods which involve careful observation and interpretation by experienced neuroscientists.

This was achieved by coordinated large-scale analyses of single-cell transcriptomes, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylomes, spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes, morphological and electrophysiological properties and cellular resolution input–output mapping, integrated through cross-modal computational analysis. Our results advance the collective knowledge and understanding of brain cell-type organization 1–5 . First, our study reveals a unified molecular genetic landscape of cortical cell types that integrates their transcriptome, open chromatin and DNA methylation maps. Second, cross-species analysis achieves a consensus taxonomy of transcriptomic types and their hierarchical organization that is conserved from mouse to marmoset and human. Third, in situ single-cell transcriptomics provides a spatially resolved cell-type atlas of the motor cortex. Fourth, cross-modal analysis provides compelling evidence for the transcriptomic, epigenomic and gene regulatory basis of neuronal phenotypes such as their physiological and anatomical properties, demonstrating the biological validity and genomic underpinning of neuron types. We further present an extensive genetic toolset for targeting glutamatergic neuron types towards linking their molecular and developmental identity to their circuit function. Together, our results establish a unifying and mechanistic framework of neuronal cell-type organization that integrates multi-layered molecular genetic and spatial information with multi-faceted phenotypic properties.<sep>Both cones or sleeves have been developed to address metaphyseal bone loss in revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but few studies have directly compared the outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the survivorship and aseptic revision rates between metaphyseal cones and sleeves at intermediate follow-up.We reviewed a consecutive series of 1,172 revision TKA patients between 2009 and 2018 with a minimum two-year follow-up on all patients. We compared demographics, surgical indication, stem fixation, constraint, rates of rerevision, and Short-Form-12 scores between patients with cones and sleeves. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify the effect of cones and sleeves on aseptic rerevision. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare aseptic survivorship of cones and sleeves.There were 194 tibial cones (17%), 107 tibial sleeves (9%), 31 femoral cones (3%), and 135 femoral sleeves (12%) with a mean follow-up of 6.5 years (range: 2-12 years). There was no difference in demographics, indication, stem fixation, or constraint (P > .05). Although overall aseptic failure rates may be lower for tibial sleeves, there were no significant differences in survivorship over a one-year, two-year, and five-year follow-up when both tibial and femoral sleeves were directly compared to cones.Both tibial and femoral sleeves and cones perform well at an intermediate-term follow-up. Further investigation of these two are required to better understand their survivorship relative to each other.<sep>Multimodal analgesia has become the standard of care for pain management following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Cannabidiol (CBD) is increasingly utilized in the postoperative period. The purpose of this study was to analyze the analgesic benefits of topical CBD following primary TKA.In this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, 80 patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA applied topical CBD (CBD; n = 19), essential oil (EO; n = 21), CBD and essential oil (CBD + EO; n = 21), or placebo (PLA; n = 19) thrice daily around the knee for two weeks postoperatively. This supplemented a standardized multimodal analgesic protocol. Outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) pain and numeric rating scale (NRS) sleep scores (collected on postoperative day [POD] 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, 42), and cumulative postoperative opioid use (42 days).Demographic characteristics were similar among the four cohorts. Preoperative VAS and NRS scores were similar among groups. The CBD cohort had a higher mean VAS pain score on POD 2 compared to the EO cohort (CBD: 69.9 ± 19.3 versus. EO: 51.0 ± 18.2; P = .013). No statistically significant differences existed for VAS scores at other times, and no statistically significant differences were observed for postoperative NRS sleep scores or postoperative opioid use at any time point.Utilization of topical CBD in supplement to multimodal analgesia did not reduce pain or opioid consumption, or improve sleep scores following TKA. These results suggest that the local effects of topical CBD are not<sep>Introduction: There is paucity of literature evaluating anterior acetabular retractor proximity to the femoral nerve and external iliac vessels during total hip arthroplasty through the direct anterior approach. In this cadaveric study, we evaluated three retractor locations to identify optimal positioning of anterior retractors. Methods: A direct anterior approach was performed in 22 hips of 15 cadavers. Anterior acetabular retractors were placed over the anterior acetabular wall in-line with the femoral neck (12-o'clock or middle position). The anterior neurovascular structures were identified through the ilioinguinal approach. Retractors were reinserted at 10-o'clock (right hip; superior) and 2-o'clock (right hip; inferior) locations marked using K-wires. Horizontal and vertical distances from retractor tip positions to neurovascular structures were measured with a digital caliper. Results: Retractor tips moved significantly from lateral to the femoral nerve when placed in the superior position (mean, 2.8 mm) to medial to the femoral nerve in the middle (mean, −2.3 mm) and inferior (mean, −4.8 mm) locations. Retractor tips moved significantly medial toward the external iliac artery when retractors were moved from superior (mean, 15.3 mm) to inferior (mean, 6.6 mm) positions placing the retractor tip closer to the vessels. Conclusion: As retractor placements moved inferior, retractor tips moved medial to neurovascular structures. Inferior retractor positioning placed the femoral nerve and external iliac artery at the risk of injury during the initial retractor placement or adjustment. Retractors should be placed in a relative safe zone superior to the 12-o'clock<sep>Background Both modular and monoblock tapered fluted titanium (TFT) stems have gained popularity over fully porous-coated cylindrical (FPCC) femoral stem designs, but limited data exist comparing subsidence rates following revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). The purpose of this study is to determine differences in subsidence and clinical outcomes among 3 revision femoral stem designs. Methods We reviewed a consecutive series of 335 patients who underwent femoral component revision to a cementless modular TFT (n = 225), monoblock TFT (n = 63), or FPCC (n = 47) stem between 2012 and 2019. We evaluated radiographic subsidence rates, re-revision rates, and patient-reported outcomes between the 3 stems. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the independent effect of stem type on the risk of subsidence >5 mm. Results At an average follow-up of 39 months (range, 12 to 96 months), there were no differences in mean subsidence rates (3.5 vs 2.4 vs 2.1 mm, P = .14), HOOS Jr scores (78 vs 74 vs 64 points, P = .15), or aseptic re-revision rates (4% vs 3% vs 0%, P = .29) between modular TFT, monoblock TFT, and FPCC stems. Although modular TFT stems were more often used in patients with extensive femoral bone loss (Paprosky III and IV), there were no differences in subsidence rates >5 mm among the 3 stems (P > .05) in multivariate analysis. Conclusion Modular TFT, monoblock TFT, and FPCC femoral stem designs all perform well in<sep>Background Probability-based computer algorithms that reduce patient burden are currently in high demand. These computer adaptive testing (CAT) methods improve workflow and reduce patient frustration, while achieving high measurement precision. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy and validity of the CAT Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) and the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Joint Replacement (HOOS-JR) by comparing them to the full version of these scoring systems in a subset of patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasties. Methods A previously developed CAT HOOS and HOOS-JR was applied to 354 and 1547 HOOS and HOOS-JR patient responses, respectively. Mean, standard deviations, Pearson’s correlation coefficients, interclass correlation coefficients, frequency distribution plots, and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare the precision, validity, and accuracy between CAT scores and full-form scores. Results By modifying the questions to past responses, the CAT HOOS demonstrated a mean reduction of 30% of questions (28 vs 40 questions). There were no significant differences between the full HOOS and CAT HOOS with respect to pain (P = .73), symptoms (P = .94), quality of life (P = .99), activities of daily living (P = .82), and sports (P = .99). There were strong linear relationships between the CAT versions and the standard questionnaires (r > 0.99). The Bland-Altman plot showed that differences between CAT HOOS and full HOOS were independent of the overall scores. Conclusion The CAT HOOS and HOOS-JR have high correlation and<sep>Background Computerized adaptive test (CAT) questionnaires may allow standardization of patient-reported outcome measures and reductions in questionnaire burden. We evaluated the validity, accuracy, and efficacy of a CAT system in patients with end-stage osteoarthritis undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Methods CAT Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) and CAT KOOS-JR questionnaires were applied to 1871 standard form KOOS and 1493 KOOS-JR patient responses, respectively. Mean, standard deviations, Pearson’s correlation coefficients, interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), frequency distribution plots, and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare the precision, validity, and accuracy between CAT scores and full-form scores. Results There was a mean reduction of 14 questions (33%) in the CAT KOOS and 1.4 questions (20%) with the CAT KOOS-JR version, compared with the standard KOOS and KOOS-JR surveys, respectively. There were no significant differences between KOOS and CAT KOOS scores with respect to pain (P = .66), symptoms (P = .43), quality of life (P = .99), activities of daily living (P = .68), and sports (P = .84). Similarly, there were no significant differences between the standard form KOOS-JR and CAT KOOS-JR scores (P = .94). There were strong correlations with minimal variability between the CAT KOOS and standard KOOS questionnaires for pain (r = 0.98, ICC: 0.98), symptoms (r = 0.97, ICC: 0.97), quality of life scores (r = 0.99, ICC: 0.99), activities of daily living scores (r = 0.99, ICC: 0.99), and sports scores (r = 0.99, ICC: 0.99). Similarly, there<sep>Background Progressive arthritis in the unresurfaced compartments of the knee is one failure mode after partial knee arthroplasty (PKA). While progressive arthritis after PKA is typically treated with revision to TKA (rTKA), staged bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (sBiKA) –the addition of another PKA - is an alternative. This study compared outcomes of sBiKA and rTKA for progressive arthritis after PKA. Methods A retrospective comparative study of non-consecutive cases at four institutions were performed in patients with an intact PKA, without loosening or wear, who underwent sBiKA (n = 27) or rTKA (n = 30), for progressive osteoarthritis. Outcomes studied were new Knee Society Function and Objective Scores (KSSF, KSSO), KOOS, Jr., ROM, operative times, length of stay, complication rates and the need for reoperations. Results Mean time to conversion was 7.4 ± 6 years for sBiKA and 9.7 ± 8 for rTKA, P = .178. Patient demographics and pre-operative outcomes were similar among cohorts. At an average of 5.7 ± 3 (sBiKA) and 3.2 ± 2 years (rTKA), KOOS, Jr. significantly improved, P < .001, by an equivalent amount. Post-operative KSSO and KSSF were significantly higher in the sBiKA cohort, respectively, (90.4 ± 10 vs 72.1 ± 20, P < .001) and (80.3 ± 18 vs 67.1 ± 19, P = .011). sBiKA patients had significantly greater improvement in KSSO (30.7 ± 33 vs 5.2 ± 18, P = .003). One sBiKA patient underwent reoperation for continued pain. Conclusion SBiKA has<sep>Abstract Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody used to reduce risk of fractures in osteoporosis. ROSALIA was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, integrated phase I/phase III study comparing the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, and safety of proposed biosimilar denosumab GP2411 with reference denosumab (REF-DMAb) (Prolia®; Amgen). Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were randomized 1:1 to two 60 mg doses of GP2411 or REF-DMAb, one at study start and one at Week 26. At Week 52, the REF-DMAb group was re-randomized 1:1 to a third dose of REF-DMAb or switch to GP2411. The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline (%CfB) in lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) at Week 52. Secondary efficacy endpoints were %CfB in LS-BMD, femoral neck (FN) BMD and total hip (TH) BMD at Weeks 26 and 78 (and Week 52 for FN-BMD and TH-BMD). Primary PK and PD endpoints were the area under the serum concentration–time curve extrapolated to infinity and maximum drug serum concentration at Week 26, and the area under the effect–time curve of the %CfB in serum carboxy-terminal crosslinked telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX) at Week 26. Secondary PK and PD endpoints included drug serum concentrations and %CfB in serum CTX and procollagen I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) during the study period.

Pathway databases such as the Reactome Knowledgebase create detailed molecular process descriptions of reactions and assemble them, based on sharing of entities between individual reactions into pathway descriptions. Results To convert the rich content of Reactome into GO-CAMs, we have developed a software tool, Pathways2GO, to convert the entire set of normal human Reactome pathways into GO-CAMs. This conversion yields standard GO annotations from Reactome content and supports enhanced quality control for both Reactome and GO, yielding a nearly seamless conversion between these two resources for the bioinformatics community. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.<sep>Gene function annotation is important for a variety of downstream analyses of genetic data. But experimental characterization of function remains costly and slow, making computational prediction an important endeavor. Phylogenetic approaches to prediction have been developed, but implementation of a practical Bayesian framework for parameter estimation remains an outstanding challenge. We have developed a computationally efficient model of evolution of gene annotations using phylogenies based on a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter estimation. Unlike previous approaches, our method is able to estimate parameters over many different phylogenetic trees and functions. The resulting parameters agree with biological intuition, such as the increased probability of function change following gene duplication. The method performs well on leave-one-out cross-validation, and we further validated some of the predictions in the experimental scientific literature.<sep>Abstract The InterPro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) provides an integrative classification of protein sequences into families, and identifies functionally important domains and conserved sites. InterProScan is the underlying software that allows protein and nucleic acid sequences to be searched against InterPro's signatures. Signatures are predictive models which describe protein families, domains or sites, and are provided by multiple databases. InterPro combines signatures representing equivalent families, domains or sites, and provides additional information such as descriptions, literature references and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce a comprehensive resource for protein classification. Founded in 1999, InterPro has become one of the most widely used resources for protein family annotation. Here, we report the status of InterPro (version 81.0) in its 20th year of operation, and its associated software, including updates to database content, the release of a new website and REST API, and performance improvements in InterProScan.<sep>Synapses are fundamental information-processing units of the brain, and synaptic dysregulation is central to many brain disorders (\"synaptopathies\"). However, systematic annotation of synaptic genes and ontology of synaptic processes are currently lacking. We established SynGO, an interactive knowledge base that accumulates available research about synapse biology using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to novel ontology terms: 87 synaptic locations and 179 synaptic processes. SynGO annotations are exclusively based on published, expert-curated evidence. Using 2,922 annotations for 1,112 genes, we show that synaptic genes are exceptionally well conserved and less tolerant to mutations than other genes. Many SynGO terms are significantly overrepresented among gene variations associated with intelligence, educational attainment, ADHD, autism, and bipolar disorder and among de novo variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. SynGO is a public, universal reference for synapse research and an online analysis platform for interpretation of large-scale -omics data (https://syngoportal.org and http://geneontology.org).<sep>The PANTHER classification system ( http://www.pantherdb.org ) is a comprehensive system that combines genomes, gene function classifications, pathways and statistical analysis tools to enable biologists to analyze large-scale genome-wide experimental data. The current system (PANTHER v.14.0) covers 131 complete genomes organized into gene families and subfamilies; evolutionary relationships between genes are represented in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and statistical models (hidden Markov models (HMMs)). The families and subfamilies are annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways. A suite of tools has been built to allow users to browse and query gene functions and analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. PANTHER is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. Since the protocol for using this tool (v.8.0) was originally published in 2013, there have been substantial improvements and updates in the areas of data quality, data coverage, statistical algorithms and user experience. This Protocol Update provides detailed instructions on how to analyze genome-wide experimental data in the PANTHER classification system.<sep>Systems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number, size, and complexity of computational models. To reproduce simulation results and reuse models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction-based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint-based models, reaction-diffusion models, logical network models, and rule-based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.<sep>The Annotation Query (AnnoQ) (http://annoq.org/) is designed to provide comprehensive and up-to-date functional annotations for human genetic variants. The system is supported by an annotation database with ∼39 million human variants from the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) pre-annotated with sequence feature annotations by WGSA and functional annotations to Gene Ontology (GO) and pathways in PANTHER. The database operates on an optimized Elasticsearch framework to support real-time complex searches. This implementation enables users to annotate data with the most up-to-date functional annotations via simple queries instead of setting up individual tools. A web interface allows users to interactively browse the annotations, annotate variants and search variant data. Its easy-to-use interface and search capabilities are well-suited for scientists with fewer bioinformatics skills such as bench scientists and statisticians. AnnoQ also has an API for users to access and annotate the data programmatically. Packages for programming languages, such as the R package, are available for users to embed the annotation queries in their scripts. AnnoQ serves researchers with a wide range of backgrounds and research interests as an integrated annotation platform.<sep>Abstract The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) provides the most comprehensive resource currently available for computable knowledge regarding the functions of genes and gene products. Here, we report the advances of the consortium over the past two years. The new GO-CAM annotation framework was notably improved, and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check and validate the rapidly increasing repository of 2838 GO-CAMs. In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to refine GO and report a 10% increase in the number of GO annotations, a 25% increase in annotated gene products, and over 9,400 new scientific articles annotated. As the project matures, we continue our efforts to review older annotations in light of newer findings, and, to maintain consistency with other ontologies. As a result, 20 000 annotations derived from experimental data were reviewed, corresponding to 2.5% of experimental GO annotations. The website (http://geneontology.org) was redesigned for quick access to documentation, downloads and tools. To maintain an accurate resource and support traceability and reproducibility, we have made available a historical archive covering the past 15 years of GO data with a consistent format and file structure for both the ontology and annotations.<sep>Abstract The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is an international community effort that aims to standardise the visualisation of pathways and networks for readers with diverse scientific backgrounds as well as to support an efficient and accurate exchange of biological knowledge between disparate research communities, industry, and other players in systems biology. SBGN comprises the three languages Entity Relationship, Activity Flow, and Process Description (PD) to cover biological and biochemical systems at distinct levels of detail. PD is closest to metabolic and regulatory pathways found in biological literature and textbooks. Its well-defined semantics offer a superior precision in expressing biological knowledge. PD represents mechanistic and temporal dependencies of biological interactions and transformations as a graph. Its different types of nodes include entity pools (e.g. metabolites, proteins, genes and complexes) and processes (e.g. reactions, associations and influences). The edges describe relationships between the nodes (e.g. consumption, production, stimulation and inhibition). This document details Level 1 Version 2.0 of the PD specification, including several improvements, in particular: 1) the addition of the equivalence operator, subunit, and annotation glyphs, 2) modification to the usage of submaps, and 3) updates to clarify the use of various glyphs (i.e. multimer, empty set, and state variable).<sep>Abstract PANTHER (Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships, http://www.pantherdb.org) is a resource for the evolutionary and functional classification of protein-coding genes from all domains of life. The evolutionary classification is based on a library of over 15,000 phylogenetic trees, and the functional classifications include Gene Ontology terms and pathways. Here, we analyze the current coverage of genes from genomes in different taxonomic groups, so that users can better understand what to expect when analyzing a gene list using PANTHER tools. We also describe extensive improvements to PANTHER made in the past two years. The PANTHER Protein Class ontology has been completely refactored, and 6101 PANTHER families have been manually assigned to a Protein Class, providing a high level classification of protein families and their genes. Users can access the TreeGrafter tool to add their own protein sequences to the reference phylogenetic trees in PANTHER, to infer evolutionary context as well as fine-grained annotations. We have added human enhancer-gene links that associate non-coding regions with the annotated human genes in PANTHER. We have also expanded the available services for programmatic access to PANTHER tools and data via application programming interfaces (APIs). Other improvements include additional plant genomes and an updated PANTHER GO-slim.<sep>The vast majority of disease-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies map to enhancers, powerful regulatory elements which orchestrate the recruitment of transcriptional complexes to their target genes' promoters to upregulate transcription in a cell type- and timing-dependent manner. These variants have implicated thousands of enhancers in many common genetic diseases, including nearly all cancers. However, the etiology of most of these diseases remains unknown because the regulatory target genes of the vast majority of enhancers are unknown. Thus, identifying the target genes of as many enhancers as possible is crucial for learning how enhancer regulatory activities function and contribute to disease. Based on experimental results curated from scientific publications coupled with machine learning methods, we developed a cell type-specific score predictive of an enhancer targeting a gene. We computed the score genome-wide for every possible cis enhancer-gene pair and validated its predictive ability in four widely used cell lines. Using a pooled final model trained across multiple cell types, all possible gene-enhancer regulatory links in cis (~17 M) were scored and added to the publicly available PEREGRINE database ( www.peregrineproj.org ). These scores provide a quantitative framework for the enhancer-gene regulatory prediction that can be incorporated into downstream statistical analyses.<sep>The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase (http://geneontology.org) is a comprehensive resource concerning the functions of genes and gene products (proteins and noncoding RNAs). GO annotations cover genes from organisms across the tree of life as well as viruses, though most gene function knowledge currently derives from experiments carried out in a relatively small number of model organisms. Here, we provide an updated overview of the GO knowledgebase, as well as the efforts of the broad, international consortium of scientists that develops, maintains, and updates the GO knowledgebase. The GO knowledgebase consists of three components: (1) the GO-a computational knowledge structure describing the functional characteristics of genes; (2) GO annotations-evidence-supported statements asserting that a specific gene product has a particular functional characteristic; and (3) GO Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMs)-mechanistic models of molecular \"pathways\" (GO biological processes) created by linking multiple GO annotations using defined relations. Each of these components is continually expanded, revised, and updated in response to newly published discoveries and receives extensive QA checks, reviews, and user feedback. For each of these components, we provide a description of the current contents, recent developments to keep the knowledgebase up to date with new discoveries, and guidance on how users can best make use of the data that we provide. We conclude with future directions for the project.<sep>Abstract Phylogenetics is a powerful tool for analyzing protein sequences, by inferring their evolutionary relationships to other proteins. However, phylogenetics analyses can be challenging: they are computationally expensive and must be performed carefully in order to avoid systematic errors and artifacts. Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER; http://pantherdb.org ) is a publicly available, user‐focused knowledgebase that stores the results of an extensive phylogenetic reconstruction pipeline that includes computational and manual processes and quality control steps. First, fully reconciled phylogenetic trees (including ancestral protein sequences) are reconstructed for a set of “reference” protein sequences obtained from fully sequenced genomes of organisms across the tree of life. Second, the resulting phylogenetic trees are manually reviewed and annotated with function evolution events: inferred gains and losses of protein function along branches of the phylogenetic tree. Here, we describe in detail the current contents of PANTHER, how those contents are generated, and how they can be used in a variety of applications. The PANTHER knowledgebase can be downloaded or accessed via an extensive API. In addition, PANTHER provides software tools to facilitate the application of the knowledgebase to common protein sequence analysis tasks: exploring an annotated genome by gene function; performing “enrichment analysis” of lists of genes; annotating a single sequence or large batch of sequences by homology; and assessing the likelihood that a genetic variant at a particular site in a protein will have deleterious effects.<sep>Abstract We aim to enable the accurate and efficient transfer of knowledge about gene function gained from Arabidopsis thaliana and other model organisms to other plant species. This knowledge transfer is frequently challenging in plants due to duplications of individual genes and whole genomes in plant lineages. Such duplications result in complex evolutionary relationships between related genes, which may have similar sequences but highly divergent functions. In such cases, functional inference requires more than a simple sequence similarity calculation. We have developed an online resource, PhyloGenes (phylogenes.org), that displays precomputed phylogenetic trees for plant gene families along with experimentally validated function information for individual genes within the families. A total of 40 plant genomes and 10 non‐plant model organisms are represented in over 8,000 gene families. Evolutionary events such as speciation and duplication are clearly labeled on gene trees to distinguish orthologs from paralogs. Nearly 6,000 families have at least one member with an experimentally supported annotation to a Gene Ontology (GO) molecular function or biological process term. By displaying experimentally validated gene functions associated to individual genes within a tree, PhyloGenes enables functional inference for genes of uncharacterized function, based on their evolutionary relationships to experimentally studied genes, in a visually traceable manner. For the many families containing genes that have evolved to perform different functions, PhyloGenes facilitates the use of evolutionary history to determine the most likely function of genes that have not been experimentally characterized. Future work will enrich the resource by incorporating additional gene function datasets such as plant gene expression atlas data.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/516797", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5036062350", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5060575386", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates expertise in neuroinformatics, deep learning, and topological methods for neuronal analysis, which aligns well with the job's focus on systems neuroscience and computational skills.

However, for some intracellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) the scramblases have not been identified. Members of the TMEM16 family have either lipid scramblase or chloride channel activity. Although TMEM16K is widely distributed and associated with the neurological disorder autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCAR10), its location in cells, function and structure are largely uncharacterised. Here we show that TMEM16K is an ER-resident lipid scramblase with a requirement for short chain lipids and calcium for robust activity. Crystal structures of TMEM16K show a scramblase fold, with an open lipid transporting groove. Additional cryo-EM structures reveal extensive conformational changes from the cytoplasmic to the ER side of the membrane, giving a state with a closed lipid permeation pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the open-groove conformation is necessary for scramblase activity.<sep>The endothelium responds to numerous chemical and mechanical factors in regulating vascular tone, blood pressure, and blood flow. The endothelial volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) has been proposed to be mechanosensitive and thereby sense fluid flow and hydrostatic pressure to regulate vascular function. Here, we show that the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8a, LRRC8A (SWELL1), is required for VRAC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Endothelial LRRC8A regulates AKT-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling under basal, stretch, and shear-flow stimulation, forms a GRB2-Cav1-eNOS signaling complex, and is required for endothelial cell alignment to laminar shear flow. Endothelium-restricted Lrrc8a KO mice develop hypertension in response to chronic angiotensin-II infusion and exhibit impaired retinal blood flow with both diffuse and focal blood vessel narrowing in the setting of type 2 diabetes (T2D). These data demonstrate that LRRC8A regulates AKT-eNOS in endothelium and is required for maintaining vascular function, particularly in the setting of T2D.<sep>Abstract Maintenance of skeletal muscle is beneficial in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Mechanical stimulation can regulate skeletal muscle differentiation, growth and metabolism, however the molecular mechanosensor remains unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 (LRRC8a) functionally encodes a swell-activated anion channel that regulates PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2, mTOR signaling, muscle differentiation, myoblast fusion, cellular oxygen consumption, and glycolysis in skeletal muscle cells. SWELL1 over-expression in SWELL1 KO myotubes boosts PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling to supra-normal levels and fully rescues myotube formation. Skeletal muscle targeted SWELL1 KO mice have smaller myofibers, generate less force ex vivo , and exhibit reduced exercise endurance, associated with increased adiposity under basal conditions, and glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when raised on a high-fat diet, compared to WT mice. These results reveal that the SWELL1-LRRC8 complex regulates insulin-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling in skeletal muscle to influence skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro and skeletal myofiber size, muscle function, adiposity and systemic metabolism in vivo .<sep>Abstract The endothelium responds to a multitude of chemical and mechanical factors in regulating vascular tone, angiogenesis, blood pressure and blood flow. The endothelial volume regulatory anion channel (VRAC) has been proposed to be mechano-sensitive, to activate in response to fluid flow/hydrostatic pressure and putatively regulate vascular reactivity and angiogenesis. Here, we show that the Leucine Rich Repeat Containing Protein 8a, LRRC8a (SWELL1) functionally encodes VRAC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Endothelial SWELL1 (SWELL1) expression positively regulates AKT-eNOS signaling while negatively regulating mTOR signaling, via a SWELL1-GRB2-Cav1-eNOS signaling complex. Endothelium-restricted SWELL1 KO (SWELL1 KO) mice exhibit enhanced tube formation from ex-vivo aortic ring explants in matrigel angiogenesis assays, develop hypertension in response to chronic angiotensin II infusion and have impaired retinal blood flow with both diffuse and focal blood vessel narrowing in the setting of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). These data demonstrate that SWELL1 antithetically regulates AKT-eNOS and mTOR signaling in endothelium and is required for maintaining vascular function, particularly in the setting of T2D.<sep>The endothelium responds to various chemical and mechanical factors in regulating vascular tone, blood pressure and blood flow. The endothelial volume regulatory anion channel (VRAC) has been proposed to be mechano-sensitive, to activate in response to fluid flow/hydrostatic pressure and putatively regulate vascular reactivity. Here we show that the Leucine Rich Repeat Containing Protein 8a, LRRC8a (SWELL1) functionally encodes VRAC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). shRNA-mediated SWELL1 knock-down impairs insulin and stretch-induced PI3K-AKT2-eNOS signaling. Endothelial SWELL1 interacts with GRB2-Cav1-eNOS. Both GRB2 knock-down and SWELL1 overexpression augment insulin-induced PI3K-AKT2-eNOS signaling in HUVECs. Consistent with SWELL1-dependent PI3K-AKT2-eNOS signaling in endothelium, endothelial-restricted SWELL1 KO mice (eSWELL1 KO) are mildly hypertensive, and exhibit mildly impaired retinal blood flow with both diffuse and focal blood vessel narrowing compared to littermate controls when raised on a regular chow diet. This reduction in retinal blood flow, reduced blood vessel size and extent of focal vessel narrowing is further exacerbated in the setting of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) when eSWELL1 KO mice are raised on a high-fat, high-sucrose diet. These data demonstrate that SWELL1 regulates PI3K-AKT2-GRB2-eNOS signaling in endothelium and is required for maintaining vascular function, particularly in the setting of T2D.<sep>Variants in genes which encode for polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 cause most forms of autosomal dominant polycystic disease (ADPKD). Despite our strong understanding of the genetic determinants of ADPKD, we do not understand the structural features which govern the function of polycystins at the molecular level, nor do we understand the impact of most disease-causing variants on the conformational state of these proteins. These questions have remained elusive because polycystins localize to several organelle membranes, including the primary cilia. Primary cilia are microtubule based organelles which function as cellular antennae. Polycystin-2 and related polycystin-2 L1 are members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, and form distinct ion channels in the primary cilia of disparate cell types which can be directly measured. Polycystin-1 has both ion channel and adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) features—but its role in forming a channel complex or as a channel subunit chaperone is undetermined. Nonetheless, recent polycystin structural determination by cryo-EM has provided a molecular template to understand their biophysical regulation and the impact of disease-causing variants. We will review these advances and discuss hypotheses regarding the regulation of polycystin channel opening by their structural domains within the context of the primary cilia.<sep>Maintenance of skeletal muscle is beneficial in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Mechanical stimulation can regulate skeletal muscle differentiation, growth and metabolism; however, the molecular mechanosensor remains unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 (Lrrc8a) functionally encodes a swell-activated anion channel that regulates PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2, mTOR signaling, muscle differentiation, myoblast fusion, cellular oxygen consumption, and glycolysis in skeletal muscle cells. LRRC8A over-expression in Lrrc8a KO myotubes boosts PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling to supra-normal levels and fully rescues myotube formation. Skeletal muscle-targeted Lrrc8a KO mice have smaller myofibers, generate less force ex vivo, and exhibit reduced exercise endurance, associated with increased adiposity under basal conditions, and glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when raised on a high-fat diet, compared to wild-type (WT) mice. These results reveal that the LRRC8 complex regulates insulin-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle to influence skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro and skeletal myofiber size, muscle function, adiposity and systemic metabolism in vivo.Skeletal muscles – the force-generating tissue attached to bones – must maintain their mass and health for the body to work properly. It is therefore necessary to understand how an organism can regulate the way skeletal muscles form, grow and heal. A multitude of factors can control how muscles form, including mechanical signals. The molecules that can sense these mechanical stimuli, however, remain unknown. Mechanoresponsive ion channels provide possible candidates for these molecular sensors. These proteins are studded through the cell membranes, where they can respond to mechanical changes by opening and allowing the flow of ions in and out of a cell, or by changing interactions with other proteins. The SWELL1 protein is a component of an ion channel known as VRAC, which potentially responds to mechanical stimuli. This channel is associated with many biological processes such as cells multiplying, migrating, growing and dying, but it is still unclear how. Here, Kumar et al. first tested whether SWELL1 controls how skeletal muscle precursors mature into their differentiated and functional form. These experiments showed that SWELL1 regulates this differentiation process under the influence of the hormone insulin, as well as mechanical signals such as cell stretching. In addition, this work revealed that SWELL1 relies on an adaptor molecule called GRB2 to relay these signals in the cell. Next, Kumar et al. genetically engineered mice lacking SWELL1 only in skeletal muscle. These animals had smaller muscle cells, as well as muscles that were weaker and less enduring. When raised on a high-calorie diet, the mutant mice also got more obese and developed resistance to insulin, which is an important step driving obesity-induced diabetes. Together, these findings show that SWELL1 helps to regulate the formation and function of muscle cells, and highlights how an ion channel participates in these processes. Healthy muscles are key for overall wellbeing, as they also protect against obesity and obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This suggests that targeting SWELL1 could prove advantageous in a clinical setting.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Missense mutation<sep>Neurogenesis<sep>Corticogenesis<sep>Haploinsufficiency<sep>Progenitor cell<sep>RNA<sep>Gene<sep>Neural stem cell<sep>Messenger RNA<sep>Induced pluripotent stem cell<sep>Central nervous system<sep>Glutamatergic<sep>Cell fate determination<sep>microRNA<sep>Neocortex<sep>Translation (biology)<sep>Translational regulation<sep>Gene expression<sep>RNA Helicase A<sep>Phenotype<sep>Microcephaly<sep>Cell type</keyword><title>Decoding mixed messages in the developing cortex: translational regulation of neural progenitor fate<sep>Pathogenic DDX3X Mutations Impair RNA Metabolism and Neurogenesis during Fetal Cortical Development<sep>A ubiquitous GC content signature underlies multimodal mRNA regulation by DDX3X<sep>Aberrant cortical development is driven by impaired cell cycle and translational control in a<i>DDX3X</i>syndrome model<sep>CNS microRNA profiles: a database for cell type enriched microRNA expression across the mouse central nervous system</title><abstract>Regulation of stem cell fate decisions is elemental to faithful development, homeostasis, and organismal fitness. Emerging data demonstrate pluripotent stem cells exhibit a vast transcriptional landscape, which is refined as cells differentiate. In the developing neocortex, transcriptional priming of neural progenitors, coupled with post-transcriptional control, is critical for defining cell fates of projection neurons. In particular, radial glial progenitors exhibit dynamic post-transcriptional regulation, including subcellular mRNA localization, RNA decay, and translation. These processes involve both cis-regulatory and trans-regulatory factors, many of which are implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. This review highlights emerging post-transcriptional mechanisms which govern cortical development, with a particular focus on translational control of neuronal fates, including those relevant for disease.<sep>De novo germline mutations in the RNA helicase DDX3X account for 1%-3% of unexplained intellectual disability (ID) cases in females and are associated with autism, brain malformations, and epilepsy. Yet, the developmental and molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X mutations impair brain function are unknown. Here, we use human and mouse genetics and cell biological and biochemical approaches to elucidate mechanisms by which pathogenic DDX3X variants disrupt brain development. We report the largest clinical cohort to date with DDX3X mutations (n = 107), demonstrating a striking correlation between recurrent dominant missense mutations, polymicrogyria, and the most severe clinical outcomes. We show that Ddx3x controls cortical development by regulating neuron generation. Severe DDX3X missense mutations profoundly disrupt RNA helicase activity, induce ectopic RNA-protein granules in neural progenitors and neurons, and impair translation. Together, these results uncover key mechanisms underlying DDX3X syndrome and highlight aberrant RNA metabolism in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disease.<sep>Abstract The road from transcription to protein synthesis is paved with many obstacles, allowing for several modes of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. A fundamental player in mRNA biology is DDX3X, an RNA binding protein that canonically regulates mRNA translation. By monitoring dynamics of mRNA abundance and translation following DDX3X depletion, we observe stabilization of translationally suppressed mRNAs. We use interpretable statistical learning models to uncover GC content in the coding sequence as the major feature underlying RNA stabilization. This result corroborates GC content-related mRNA regulation detectable in other studies, including hundreds of ENCODE datasets and recent work focusing on mRNA dynamics in the cell cycle. We provide further evidence for mRNA stabilization by detailed analysis of RNA-seq profiles in hundreds of samples, including a Ddx3x conditional knockout mouse model exhibiting cell cycle and neurogenesis defects. Our study identifies a ubiquitous feature underlying mRNA regulation and highlights the importance of quantifying multiple steps of the gene expression cascade, where RNA abundance and protein production are often uncoupled.<sep>Abstract Mutations in the RNA helicase, DDX3X , are a leading cause of Intellectual Disability and present as DDX3X syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with cortical malformations and autism. Yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X controls cortical development are largely unknown. Here, using a mouse model of Ddx3x loss-of-function we demonstrate that DDX3X directs translational and cell cycle control of neural progenitors, which underlies precise corticogenesis. First, we show brain development is highly sensitive to Ddx3x dosage; Complete Ddx3x loss from neural progenitors causes microcephaly in females, whereas hemizygous males and heterozygous females show reduced neurogenesis without marked microcephaly. In addition, Ddx3x loss is sexually dimorphic, as its paralog, Ddx3y, compensates for Ddx3x in the developing male neocortex. Using live imaging of progenitors, we show that DDX3X promotes neuronal generation by regulating both cell cycle duration and neurogenic divisions. Finally, we use ribosome profiling in vivo to discover the repertoire of translated transcripts in neural progenitors, including those which are DDX3X-dependent and essential for neurogenesis. Our study reveals invaluable new insights into the etiology of DDX3X syndrome, implicating dysregulated progenitor cell cycle dynamics and translation as pathogenic mechanisms.<sep>Abstract microRNAs are short, noncoding RNAs that can regulate hundreds of targets and thus shape the expression landscape of a cell. Similar to mRNA, they often exhibit cell type enriched expression and serve to reinforce cellular identity. In tissue with high cellular complexity, such as the central nervous system (CNS), it is difficult to attribute microRNA changes to a particular cell type. To facilitate interpretation of microRNA studies in these tissues, we used previously generated data to develop a publicly accessible and user-friendly database to enable exploration of cell type enriched microRNA expression. We provide illustrations of how this database can be utilized as a reference as well as for hypothesis generation. First, we suggest a putative role for miR-21 in the microglial spinal injury response. Second, we highlight data indicating that differential microRNA expression, specifically miR-326, may in part explain regional differences in inflammatory cells. Finally, we show that miR-383 expression is enriched in cortical glutamatergic neurons, suggesting a unique role in these cells. These examples illustrate the database’s utility in guiding research towards unstudied regulators in the CNS. This novel resource will aid future research into microRNA-based regulatory mechanisms responsible for cellular phenotypes within the CNS.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/12799873", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5052891868", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5074623444", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in molecular and cellular biology, particularly in areas related to ion channels, signaling pathways, and skeletal muscle, which aligns well with the wet lab components of the job.

Samples were recruited from the privately-owned pet population from October 2013 – May 2015 as part of a larger case-control study with the goal of understanding genetic and environmental risk factors for T zone Lymphoma. Blood samples were genotyped using the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip. Dogs were categorized as case, TZUS, or control. The list of individuals provided has undergone quality control filtering, including: 1) removing dogs with call rates <97.5%, 2) removing dogs of European origin, and 3) removing highly related individuals (half-sibling or closer). For our analysis, we additionally did QC on the SNP dataset, including removing SNPs with call rates <97.5 or minor allele frequency <5%. However, the .bed and .bim files provided are unfiltered.<sep>The most common subtype of lymphoma in the dog is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The remaining forms of B-cell lymphoma in dogs are categorized as small-to-intermediate in size and include marginal zone, follicular, mantle cell, and small-cell lymphocytic lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma have readily identifiable unique histologic features while other forms of small B-cell lymphoma in the dog are poorly described by histopathology. Forty-seven cases of nodal small B-cell lymphoma identified by flow cytometry (small cell size based on forward scatter) with concurrent histopathology were reviewed. These cases fell into 3 histologic subtypes: marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and a diffuse form of small B-cell lymphoma with consistent features. As a descriptive term, we refer to the latter subtype as diffuse small B-cell lymphoma (DSBCL) until it can be further characterized by gene expression profiling and other molecular tools. Clinical presentation of DSBCL was compared to cases of histologically confirmed DLBCL and clinical follow-up was obtained for 22 of the 27 cases of DSBCL. This subset of diffuse small B-cell lymphoma had an overall median survival of 140 days. The expression of CD21, class II MHC and CD25 by flow cytometry did not differ between DSBCL and the other histologic subtypes of small cell B-cell lymphoma making histopathology the only current method of classification.<sep>T zone lymphoma (TZL), a histologic variant of peripheral T cell lymphoma, represents about 12% of all canine lymphomas. Golden Retrievers appear predisposed, representing over 40% of TZL cases. Prior research found that asymptomatic aged Golden Retrievers frequently have populations of T zone-like cells (phenotypically identical to TZL) of undetermined significance (TZUS), potentially representing a pre-clinical state. These findings suggest a genetic risk factor for this disease and caused us to investigate potential genes of interest using a genome-wide association study of privately-owned U.S. Golden Retrievers. Dogs were categorized as TZL (n = 95), TZUS (n = 142), or control (n = 101) using flow cytometry and genotyped using the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip. Using a mixed linear model adjusting for population stratification, we found association with genome-wide significance in regions on chromosomes 8 and 14. The chromosome 14 peak included four SNPs (Odds Ratio = 1.18–1.19, p = .3 × 10− 5–5.1 × 10− 5) near three hyaluronidase genes (SPAM1, HYAL4, and HYALP1). Targeted resequencing of this region using a custom sequence capture array identified missense mutations in all three genes; the variant in SPAM1 was predicted to be damaging. These mutations were also associated with risk for mast cell tumors among Golden Retrievers in an unrelated study. The chromosome 8 peak contained 7 SNPs (Odds Ratio = 1.24–1.42, p = 2.7 × 10− 7–7.5 × 10− 5) near genes involved in thyroid hormone regulation (DIO2 and TSHR). A prior study from our laboratory found hypothyroidism is inversely associated with TZL risk. No coding mutations were found with targeted resequencing but identified variants may play a regulatory role for all or some of the genes. The pathogenesis of canine TZL may be related to hyaluronan breakdown and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory and pro-oncogenic byproducts. The association on chromosome 8 may indicate thyroid hormone is involved in TZL development, consistent with findings from a previous study evaluating epidemiologic risk factors for TZL. Future work is needed to elucidate these mechanisms.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Waveform<sep>Capacitor<sep>Attractor<sep>Energy harvesting<sep>Bifurcation<sep>Pendulum<sep>Topology (electrical circuits)<sep>Control theory (sociology)<sep>Conditioning<sep>Topology optimization<sep>Electric potential energy<sep>Energy (signal processing)<sep>Nonlinear system<sep>Frequency conversion<sep>RC circuit</keyword><title>Patterned rotary parallel-plate capacitor for frequency up-conversion and RC circuit waveform conditioning<sep>An Analysis of the Gimballed Horizontal Pendulum System for Use as a Rotary Vibrational Energy Harvester<sep>Topological optimization of variable area plate capacitors for coupled electromechanical energy harvesters<sep>Potential well hopping and performance of ocean energy harvesters<sep>Investigating threshold escape behavior for the gimballed horizontal pendulum system</title><abstract>This paper details a patterned electrostatic rotary capacitive plate design with high energy densities and provides a novel strategy for up-converting low frequency mechanical excitation sources.

Both the full wave and Eigenmode simulation show a variation of 180-360 degrees tunable phase within 6.6-7.2 GHz.

The attenuator is formed by locating two GSSs symmetrically on both sides of the SSPP waveguide. Both the surface impedance of GSSs and the attenuation of the attenuator are tunable by changing the bias voltage applied to the graphene sheets. The transmission line theory is employed to model the proposed SSPP waveguide and attenuator. Measurement shows two orders of magnitude attenuation range with bias voltage changing from 0 to 4 V.

Fictitious surface electric and magnetic currents are implemented through non periodic metasurfaces to create the required field discontinuity for radiation in the desired direction. The method has the advantage of customizing the wave front based on the generated electric and magnetic fields generated by the feeding antenna. As an example, a metalens is designed for three dual-polarized stack patch antennas for the operation at the 5G sub-6GHz band of 3.1-3.6 GHz. The designed six-port MIMO antenna provides three beams at 0 and +/−12 degrees with vertical and horizontal polarizations, with the maximum realized gain of 21 dBi and the aperture efficiency of over 33%.<sep>Abstract We proposed a high gain high-efficiency compact metallic resonator antenna operating at even-mode meander line spoof surface plasmon polaritons (MLSSPPs). The high radiation efficiency is caused by the bulk of fields crowded in lossless air near the antenna rather than in lossy dielectric as in conventional dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs). The proposed antenna also exhibits compact size because of its high effective refractive index. A reliable equivalent circuit model is proposed for the design of the resonator antenna with basic mode of half wavelength resonant mode. As an example, a meander-line SSPP antenna is designed, fabricated and measured. Both the simulated and measured results show the advantages of high efficiency and compact volume. In addition, the antenna achieves higher gain and wider relative bandwidth per wavelength cube volume compared with its counterparts. This method provides a good alternative for designing DRAs.<sep>This article proposes a compact high-efficiency metallic resonator antenna operating at even-mode spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). The collective electron oscillations within the structure increase the effective relative permittivity that can be tuned by engineering the dispersion of SSPP modes on the structure. The even-mode SSPPs are excited by placing a radiator at their vicinity. As an example, a resonator antenna is designed using the comb-like SSPP structure. The proposed metallic resonator antenna achieves low loss and hence high radiation efficiency because majority of fields of SSPP modes concentrates in air rather than in dielectric compared with conventional dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs). The proposed design also employs compact size due to the high effective relative permittivity and planar configuration of the SSPP resonator. A prototype was fabricated and measured. Both the simulated and measured results show the advantages of higher efficiency of 95.2% and more compact volume of 0.0002λ <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> over a DRA. This method provides a good alternative for designing DRAs.<sep>A compact dual-band high-efficiency antenna based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) is proposed by well exciting both the TM10 mode and the LC resonant mode. Each mode can be tuned separately without affecting the other mode. The whole SSPP slab is utilized as the radiator of the TM10 mode, while the air ring gap, the shorting pin, and a minor part of SSPP slab work as the radiator of the LC resonant mode. The compact size and the high radiation efficiency of the proposed antenna are due to the high field confinement and high effective refractive index of SSPPs. A reliable circuit model is first proposed for an SSPP antenna and applied to design it for dual-band operation. A prototype was fabricated using PCB technology and measured. The proposed antenna achieves a compact electrical size of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.18\\lambda _{\\mathbf {0}} \\times 0.18\\lambda _{\\mathbf {0}} \\times 0.07\\lambda _{\\mathbf {0}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> , which is significantly smaller than its counterparts ( <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\lambda _{\\mathbf {0}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the wavelength at lower resonant frequency).

Series II: Nachlass. A: Nachgelassene Schriften. Vol. 13: Ästhetische Schriften</title><abstract>Abstract According to what is now the standard account in the history of psychology, in the 1880s William James and the Danish physician Carl Georg Lange independently developed a strikingly new theory, commonly referred to as the ‘James–Lange’ theory of emotion. In this paper it is argued that this standard account is highly misleading. Lange's views on affect in his (1885) Om Sindsbevægelser were more cautious than James allowed, and not open to criticisms that have often been levelled against the theory of emotion that James claimed he shared with Lange. In fact, Lange argued for distinctions that James did not mention in his discussion of Lange's work. Even with regard to the primary emotions, the two thinkers’ explanatory models diverged significantly. The contrast between James and Lange on affect is especially striking in their respective discussions of topics in aesthetics, as is established with reference to Lange's little-known (1899) Bidrag til Nydelsernes fysiologi som grundlag for en rationel æstetik.<sep>This chapter identifies three rival interpretations of Autumn Sonata. A first reading describes a work that, like Face to Face, was conceived along Janovian lines, and that consequently resonates positively with the tenets of Janov’s psychology. The second and third interpretations both deny that Autumn Sonata is consistently Janovian. According to one kind of ‘non-Janovian’ interpretation, Bergman worked with significant Janovian premises as he conceived of the story and characterizations for Autumn Sonata, yet for various reasons, the director did not, finally, go on to make a thoroughly Janovian work. An alternative interpretation contends that Bergman had taken some critical distance from at least some of the main tenets of Janov’s psychological theory and successfully expressed these reservations in his film. In other words, Bergman was not thoroughly or consistently persuaded of the truth of Janov’s theoretical contentions, either at the time of his initial, enthusiastic reading of The Primal Screen or upon subsequent reflection. On the basis of an examination of the relevant evidence, the chapter argues that although Bergman undeniably sought to bring out a story along Janovian lines, he ended up with one that instructively manifests ways in which that doctrine is incomplete and problematic.<sep>At the time of his death in 1848, Bernard Bolzano had completed two essays in aesthetics, one on beauty and one on the fine arts (Bolzano, 1843, 1849, 2015, 2017; for background and commentary see Rusnock and Šebestík, 2019, pp. 544–594; Livingston, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2021). Bolzano continued in his final years to work on topics in aesthetics, leaving behind a variety of drafts and notes. The volume under review is the long-awaited publication of this Nachlass. Editorial work on the volume was begun many years ago by the talented and industrious Bolzano scholar, Jan Berg, yet remained incomplete at the time of his death in 2015. The editor-in-chief of the Bernard-Bolzano-Gesamtausgabe, Edgar Morscher, shouldered the responsibility for bringing the project to completion. He was assisted by Kurt F. Strasser and Berg’s long-time collaborator, Peter Michael Schenkel. The contents of this volume can be briefly indicated as follows: This is critical-editorial scholarship at its best. The manuscripts that Bolzano left behind are in a very difficult and, at times, illegible hand. Bolzano used many abbreviations, only hinting at the words he had in mind. He made many corrections, often filled the margins with additions, and struck out lines or even entire pages of legible prose. The transcription of these texts demanded a painstaking and time-consuming process of educated mind-reading, an art that Berg had duly perfected in his editing of many volumes in the Gesamtausgabe.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/201435/assistant-professor-russian-language-department/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5040625813", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5035147022", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research aligns more closely with the technical and scientific requirements of the job, particularly in areas related to quantum processes and noncommutative geometry, which are relevant to modern educational technologies and methodologies.

We recently showed that ductal cells clonally expand as self-renewing liver organoids that retain their differentiation capacity into both hepatocytes and ductal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which adult ductal-committed cells acquire cellular plasticity, initiate organoids and regenerate the damaged tissue remain largely unknown. Here, we describe that ductal cells undergo a transient, genome-wide, remodelling of their transcriptome and epigenome during organoid initiation and in vivo following tissue damage. TET1-mediated hydroxymethylation licences differentiated ductal cells to initiate organoids and activate the regenerative programme through the transcriptional regulation of stem-cell genes and regenerative pathways including the YAP-Hippo signalling. Our results argue in favour of the remodelling of genomic methylome/hydroxymethylome landscapes as a general mechanism by which differentiated cells exit a committed state in response to tissue damage.<sep>The number of patients diagnosed with chronic bile duct disease is increasing and in most cases these diseases result in chronic ductular scarring, necessitating liver transplantation. The formation of ductular scaring affects liver function; however, scar-generating portal fibroblasts also provide important instructive signals to promote the proliferation and differentiation of biliary epithelial cells. Therefore, understanding whether we can reduce scar formation while maintaining a pro-regenerative microenvironment will be essential in developing treatments for biliary disease. Here, we describe how regenerating biliary epithelial cells express Wnt-Planar Cell Polarity signalling components following bile duct injury and promote the formation of ductular scars by upregulating pro-fibrogenic cytokines and positively regulating collagen-deposition. Inhibiting the production of Wnt-ligands reduces the amount of scar formed around the bile duct, without reducing the development of the pro-regenerative microenvironment required for ductular regeneration, demonstrating that scarring and regeneration can be uncoupled in adult biliary disease and regeneration.<sep>Right-sided (proximal) colorectal cancer (CRC) has a poor prognosis and a distinct mutational profile, characterized by oncogenic BRAF mutations and aberrations in mismatch repair and TGFβ signalling. Here, we describe a mouse model of right-sided colon cancer driven by oncogenic BRAF and loss of epithelial TGFβ-receptor signalling. The proximal colonic tumours that develop in this model exhibit a foetal-like progenitor phenotype (Ly6a/Sca1+) and, importantly, lack expression of Lgr5 and its associated intestinal stem cell signature. These features are recapitulated in human BRAF-mutant, right-sided CRCs and represent fundamental differences between left- and right-sided disease. Microbial-driven inflammation supports the initiation and progression of these tumours with foetal-like characteristics, consistent with their predilection for the microbe-rich right colon and their antibiotic sensitivity. While MAPK-pathway activating mutations drive this foetal-like signature via ERK-dependent activation of the transcriptional coactivator YAP, the same foetal-like transcriptional programs are also initiated by inflammation in a MAPK-independent manner. Importantly, in both contexts, epithelial TGFβ-receptor signalling is instrumental in suppressing the tumorigenic potential of these foetal-like progenitor cells.<sep>The tumour suppressor APC is the most commonly mutated gene in colorectal cancer. Loss of Apc in intestinal stem cells drives the formation of adenomas in mice via increased WNT signalling1, but reduced secretion of WNT ligands increases the ability of Apc-mutant intestinal stem cells to colonize a crypt (known as fixation)2. Here we investigated how Apc-mutant cells gain a clonal advantage over wild-type counterparts to achieve fixation. We found that Apc-mutant cells are enriched for transcripts that encode several secreted WNT antagonists, with Notum being the most highly expressed. Conditioned medium from Apc-mutant cells suppressed the growth of wild-type organoids in a NOTUM-dependent manner. Furthermore, NOTUM-secreting Apc-mutant clones actively inhibited the proliferation of surrounding wild-type crypt cells and drove their differentiation, thereby outcompeting crypt cells from the niche. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NOTUM abrogated the ability of Apc-mutant cells to expand and form intestinal adenomas. We identify NOTUM as a key mediator during the early stages of mutation fixation that can be targeted to restore wild-type cell competitiveness and provide preventative strategies for people at a high risk of developing colorectal cancer.<sep>The genomic landscape of colorectal cancer (CRC) is shaped by inactivating mutations in tumour suppressors such as APC, and oncogenic mutations such as mutant KRAS. Here we used genetically engineered mouse models, and multimodal mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to study the impact of common genetic drivers of CRC on the metabolic landscape of the intestine. We show that untargeted metabolic profiling can be applied to stratify intestinal tissues according to underlying genetic alterations, and use mass spectrometry imaging to identify tumour, stromal and normal adjacent tissues. By identifying ions that drive variation between normal and transformed tissues, we found dysregulation of the methionine cycle to be a hallmark of APC-deficient CRC. Loss of Apc in the mouse intestine was found to be sufficient to drive expression of one of its enzymes, adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY), which was also found to be transcriptionally upregulated in human CRC. Targeting of AHCY function impaired growth of APC-deficient organoids in vitro, and prevented the characteristic hyperproliferative/crypt progenitor phenotype driven by acute deletion of Apc in vivo, even in the context of mutant Kras. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of AHCY reduced intestinal tumour burden in ApcMin/+ mice indicating its potential as a metabolic drug target in CRC.<sep>Abstract Oncogenic mutations in otherwise normal tissue are common in many adult tissues 1,2 . This suggests multiple events need to converge to drive tumourigenesis and that many processes such as tissue differentiation may be protective against carcinogenesis. Within the liver Wnt/β-catenin signalling maintains zonal differentiation during liver homeostasis 3,4 . However, the CTNNB1 oncogene—encoding β-catenin—is also frequently mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in aberrant Wnt signalling that promotes cell growth 5,6 . Here we investigated the antagonistic interplay between Wnt-driven growth and differentiation in zonal hepatocyte populations during liver tumorigenesis. We found that β-catenin mutants transiently stimulated growth in zone-1 and -2 hepatocytes within the Wnt-low region of the liver lobule – before inducing a differentiated zone-3 fate. One key feature lacking within the differentiated zone-3 hepatocytes that is often upregulated in human cancer was MYC which can synergise with β-catenin to initiate HCC in mice. When mutant β-catenin and MYC were expressed cell-agnostically across the liver lobule, a subset of mutant hepatocytes were proliferative and tumorigenic. These exhibited a selective upregulation of the zone-2 factors IGFBP2, cyclin D1, and mTOR and a reduction in the levels of Wnt signalling when compared to non-proliferative Wnt-high single cell clones. Inhibition of mTOR signalling with Rapamycin blocked tumourigenesis. Furthermore, restricting β-catenin and MYC mutations with Lgr5-Cre to zone-3 hepatocytes suppressed tumourigenesis. This was associated with high Wnt signalling and the lack of zone-2 factors permissive to growth. Importantly other oncogenic-drivers could promote tumourigenesis from zone-3 hepatocytes but tumours that arose had all lost their zone 3 features. Therefore we propose that zonal identity dictates hepatocyte susceptibility to Wnt-driven tumorigenesis and that escaping Wnt-induced differentiation is essential for liver cancer.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Interactome<sep>Transcription (linguistics)<sep>Bromodomain<sep>Histone<sep>Promoter<sep>Live cell imaging<sep>Fluorescence microscope<sep>Nucleic acid<sep>Transcription factor<sep>DNA-binding protein<sep>Small molecule<sep>DNA<sep>Chromatin<sep>G-quadruplex<sep>RNA polymerase II<sep>Breast cancer<sep>Transcription coregulator<sep>Fluorescence<sep>Gene</keyword><title>Promoter G-quadruplex folding precedes transcription and is controlled by chromatin<sep>Chem-map profiles drug binding to chromatin in cells<sep>Chemical profiling of DNA G-quadruplex-interacting proteins in live cells<sep>Landscape of G-quadruplex DNA structural regions in breast cancer<sep>Single-molecule visualization of DNA G-quadruplex formation in live cells</title><abstract>Four-stranded G-quadruplexes (G4s) are DNA secondary structures in the human genome that are primarily found in active promoters associated with elevated transcription. Here, we explore the relationship between the folding of promoter G4s, transcription and chromatin state.Transcriptional inhibition by DRB or by triptolide reveals that promoter G4 formation, as assessed by G4 ChIP-seq, does not depend on transcriptional activity. We then show that chromatin compaction can lead to loss of promoter G4s and is accompanied by a corresponding loss of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), thus establishing a link between G4 formation and chromatin accessibility. Furthermore, pre-treatment of cells with a G4-stabilising ligand mitigates the loss of Pol II at promoters induced by chromatin compaction.Overall, our findings show that G4 folding is coupled to the establishment of accessible chromatin and does not require active transcription.<sep>Abstract Characterizing drug–target engagement is essential to understand how small molecules influence cellular functions. Here we present Chem-map for in situ mapping of small molecules that interact with DNA or chromatin-associated proteins, utilizing small-molecule-directed transposase Tn5 tagmentation. We demonstrate Chem-map for three distinct drug-binding modalities as follows: molecules that target a chromatin protein, a DNA secondary structure or that intercalate in DNA. We map the BET bromodomain protein-binding inhibitor JQ1 and provide interaction maps for DNA G-quadruplex structure-binding molecules PDS and PhenDC3. Moreover, we determine the binding sites of the widely used anticancer drug doxorubicin in human leukemia cells; using the Chem-map of doxorubicin in cells exposed to the histone deacetylase inhibitor tucidinostat reveals the potential clinical advantages of this combination therapy. In situ mapping with Chem-map of small-molecule interactions with DNA and chromatin proteins provides insights that will enhance understanding of genome and chromatin function and therapeutic interventions.<sep>DNA-protein interactions regulate critical biological processes. Identifying proteins that bind to specific, functional genomic loci is essential to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms on a molecular level. Here we describe a co-binding-mediated protein profiling (CMPP) strategy to investigate the interactome of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) in native chromatin. CMPP involves cell-permeable, functionalized G4-ligand probes that bind endogenous G4s and subsequently crosslink to co-binding G4-interacting proteins in situ. We first showed the robustness of CMPP by proximity labelling of a G4 binding protein in vitro. Employing this approach in live cells, we then identified hundreds of putative G4-interacting proteins from various functional classes. Next, we confirmed a high G4-binding affinity and selectivity for several newly discovered G4 interactors in vitro, and we validated direct G4 interactions for a functionally important candidate in cellular chromatin using an independent approach. Our studies provide a chemical strategy to map protein interactions of specific nucleic acid features in living cells.<sep>Response and resistance to anticancer therapies vary due to intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity1. Here, we map differentially enriched G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structure-forming regions (∆G4Rs) in 22 breast cancer patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models. ∆G4Rs are associated with the promoters of highly amplified genes showing high expression, and with somatic single-nucleotide variants. Differences in ΔG4R landscapes reveal seven transcription factor programs across PDTXs. ∆G4R abundance and locations stratify PDTXs into at least three G4-based subtypes. ∆G4Rs in most PDTXs (14 of 22) were found to associate with more than one breast cancer subtype, which we also call an integrative cluster (IC)2. This suggests the frequent coexistence of multiple breast cancer states within a PDTX model, the majority of which display aggressive triple-negative IC10 gene activity. Short-term cultures of PDTX models with increased ∆G4R levels are more sensitive to small molecules targeting G4 DNA. Thus, G4 landscapes reveal additional IC-related intratumor heterogeneity in PDTX biopsies, improving breast cancer stratification and potentially identifying new treatment strategies.<sep>Substantial evidence now exists to support that formation of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) is coupled to altered gene expression. However, approaches that allow us to probe G4s in living cells without perturbing their folding dynamics are required to understand their biological roles in greater detail. Herein, we report a G4-specific fluorescent probe (SiR-PyPDS) that enables single-molecule and real-time detection of individual G4 structures in living cells. Live-cell single-molecule fluorescence imaging of G4s was carried out under conditions that use low concentrations of SiR-PyPDS (20 nM) to provide informative measurements representative of the population of G4s in living cells, without globally perturbing G4 formation and dynamics. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging and time-dependent chemical trapping of unfolded G4s in living cells reveal that G4s fluctuate between folded and unfolded states. We also demonstrate that G4 formation in live cells is cell-cycle-dependent and disrupted by chemical inhibition of transcription and replication. Our observations provide robust evidence in support of dynamic G4 formation in living cells. Visualization of endogenous G-quadruplexes (G4s) in living cells by fluorescence microscopy has been hampered by the high concentrations of G4-binding probes required, which can artificially induce additional G4 formation. Now, a G4-specific fluorescent probe (SiR-PyPDS) has been developed that enables single-molecule and real-time detection of individual G4 structures in living cells without perturbing G4 formation and dynamics.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/527396", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5009014324", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5031037289", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A has extensive experience in molecular biology, cancer research, and stem cell biology, with a focus on Wnt signaling, MAPK/ERK pathways, and organoid formation, which aligns well with the molecular virology and biochemistry aspects of the job.

A significant change is the new grading system for these tumours, including the innovative involvement of tumour profiling at the molecular level in the system for determining the degree of tumour differentiation and the application of the principle of integrated diagnostics, i. e. the synthesis of available histopathological and molecular findings<sep>Examination of changes in the methylation profile of DNA in cancer is currently used to determine the diagnosis or prognostic and predictive biomarkers. It complements histological or molecular biological examinations. At the same time, it helps to identify new diagnostic groups and subgroups. Currently, this diagnosis is most common in brain tumors, where it has become a routine examination. The established methylation profile may help even where the diagnosis or subgroup classification of the disease cannot be determined in any<sep>Abstract Congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN), the most common renal tumor of infancy, is a mesenchymal neoplasm histologically classified into classic, cellular, or mixed types. Most cellular CMNs harbor a characteristic ETV6‐NTRK3 fusion. Here, we report an unusual congenital mesoblastic nephroma presenting in a newborn boy with a novel EML4‐ALK gene fusion revealed by Anchored Multiplex RNA Sequencing Assay. The EML4‐ALK gene fusion expands the genetic spectrum implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital mesoblastic nephroma, with yet another example of kinase<sep>Molecular assays for translocation detection in different tumors have gradually been incorporated into routine diagnostics. However, conventional methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-PCR come with several drawbacks.

Lysine-specific demethylase 5B (KDM5B), is a member of the KDM5 family of histone demethylases, whose dysregulation has been observed in numerous types of cancer and plays a role in drug tolerance. The present study examined KDM5B expression in high risk neuroblastoma cell lines. Its level was markedly reduced in cisplatin-resistant cells, UKF-NB-4CDDP, compared with parental sensitive cells UKF-NB-4. Moreover, KDM5B-silencing did not affect either viability nor the response to CDDP in<sep>Over the past decade, wingless-activated (WNT) medulloblastoma has been identified as a candidate for therapy de-escalation based on excellent survival; however, a paucity of relapses has precluded additional analyses of markers of relapse. To address this gap in knowledge, an international cohort of 93 molecularly confirmed WNT MB was assembled, where 5-year progression-free survival is 0.84 (95%, 0.763-0.925) with 15 relapsed individuals identified. Maintenance chemotherapy is identified as a strong predictor of relapse, with individuals receiving high doses of cyclophosphamide<sep>In the clinical management of paediatric solid tumours, histological examination of tumour tissue obtained by a biopsy remains the gold standard to establish a conclusive pathological diagnosis. The DNA methylation pattern of a tumour is known to correlate with the histopathological diagnosis across cancer types and is showing promise in the diagnostic workup of tumour samples. This methylation pattern can be detected in the cell-free DNA.

Although considered gliomas, G34R/V tumors actually arise in GSX2/DLX-expressing interneuron progenitors, where G34R/V mutations impair neuronal differentiation. The lineage of origin may facilitate PDGFRA co-option through a chromatin loop connecting PDGFRA to<sep>The current progress and increasing knowledge about the genetic causes of cancer opens up new possibilities for its treatment. However, it is necessary to combine the results obtained using classical pathological methods with sensitive, multiplex molecular pathological methods. The method that meets the required criteria is MLPA based on multiplex PCR reaction. This method detects both changes in gene copy number and DNA methylation and, last but not least, point mutations. The MLPA reaction is applicable to even highly fragmented<sep>Abstract In this study, we provide a comprehensive clinical and molecular biological characterization of radiation-induced gliomas (RIG), including a risk assessment for developing gliomas. A cohort of 12 patients who developed RIG 9.5 years (3–31 years) after previous cranial radiotherapy for brain tumors or T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was established. The derived risk of RIG development based on our consecutive cohort of 371 irradiated patients was 1.6% at 10 years and 3.02% at 15 years.

NMYC amplification or overexpression is associated with the malignant behavior of NBL tumors. In the present study, we revealed an association between long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) and NMYC amplification in NBL cell lines and MIAT expression in NBL tissue samples. MIAT silencing induces cell death only in cells with NMYC amplification, but in NBL cells<sep>Multiple head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) are neuroendocrine tumors of a mostly benign nature that can be associated with a syndrome, precipitated by the presence of a germline mutation. Familial forms of the disease are usually seen with mutations of SDHx genes, especially the SDHD gene. SDHB mutations are predisposed to malignant tumors. We found 6 patients with multiple tumors amongst 30 patients with HNPGLs during the period of 2016 to 2021. We discuss the phenotypic and genetic patterns in<sep>Introduction Head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors, which are mostly benign in nature. Amongst all genes, Succinate Dehydrogenase Subunit D ( SDHD ) is the most commonly mutated in familial HNPGLs. In about 30% of HNPGLs, germline mutations in SDHD can also occur in the absence of positive family history, thus giving rise to “occult familial” cases. Our aim was to evaluate the pattern of SDHD germline mutations in Czech patients with HNPGLs. Materials and methods We<sep>Pontine gliomas represent difficult to treat entity due to the location and heterogeneous biology varying from indolent low-grade gliomas to aggressive diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Making the correct tumor diagnosis in the pontine location is thus critical. Here, we report a case study of a 14-month-old patient initially diagnosed as histone H3 wild-type DIPG. Due to the low age of the patient, the MRI appearance of DIPG, and anaplastic astrocytoma histology, intensive chemotherapy based on the HIT-SKK protocol with<sep>Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) constitute a heterogeneous spectrum of tumors with respect to clinical behavior and tumor morphology. The paternal uniparental disomy (pUPD) of 11p15.5 is a molecular change described mainly in embryonal RMS. In addition to LOH, UPD, the MLPA technique (ME030kit) also determines copy number variants and methylation of H19 and KCNQ1OT1 genes, which have not been systematically investigated in RMS. All 127 RMS tumors were divided by histology and PAX status into four groups, pleomorphic histology (n = 2);<sep>Abstract BACKGROUND Heterogeneous pathology in hemispheric low-grade gliomas (hemLGG) stress the importance of molecular testing in terms of prognosis prediction and targeted therapy options. METHODS Demographic data was collected and targeted genomic approach was employed in the single institutional study. RT-PCR was used to screen for KIAA1549-BRAF fusion and FGFR1 tyrosine-kinase domain duplication (FGFR1-ITD). Direct sequencing evaluated point mutations (BRAF ex15 and ex11, FGFR1 ex12 and ex14). Samples with no detected alteration were subjected to panel RNA-sequencing (FusionPlex Archer Diagnostics).<sep>Abstract Radiation-induced gliomas (RIGs) are the most common secondary solid tumours with very unfavourable prognosis. We aimed to describe different clinical and molecular biological characteristic of RIGs from primary gliomas. We reviewed clinical data of ten patients with RIGs. In patients with available samples, we used the whole genome methylation array and performed targeted sequencing for specific mutations. Between 2000–2018, we diagnosed RIG in 10 patients (M/F 2/8) aged 5–12 years at primary diagnosis of different solid tumours and acute<sep>The analysis of urinary catecholamine metabolites is a cornerstone of neuroblastoma diagnostics. Currently, there is no consensus regarding the sampling method, and variable combinations of catecholamine metabolites are being used. We investigated if spot urine samples can be reliably used for analysis of a panel of catecholamine metabolites for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma.Twenty-four-hour urine or spot urine samples were collected from patients with and without neuroblastoma at diagnosis. Homovanillic acid (HVA), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, norepinephrine, normetanephrine, epinephrine and<sep>Paediatric tumours are often characterised by the presence of recurrent DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). These DNA copy number profiles, obtained from a tissue biopsy, can aid in the correct prognostic classification and therapeutic stratification of several paediatric cancer entities (e.g. MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma) and are part of the routine diagnostic practice. Liquid biopsies (LQBs) offer a potentially safer alternative for such invasive tumour tissue biopsies and can provide deeper insight into tumour heterogeneity.The robustness and reliability of LQB<sep>Abstract BACKGROUND Significant heterogeneity of pediatric brain tumors poses major challenge on diagnostics. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate feasibility of methylation array in the diagnostic process. METHODS Methylation array (Infinium MethylationEPIC, Illumina) was performed on DNA extracted from fresh frozen tissue from prospective newly diagnosed and selected retrospective patients. Results from Heidelberg classifier (www.molecularneuropathology.org) were compared to the histological diagnosis and further genetic testing was performed to establish integrated morphological/molecular diagnosis. RESULTS Within years 2018–2019, we performed methylation array profiling<sep>Malignant astrocytic gliomas in children show a remarkable biological and clinical diversity. Small in-frame insertions or missense mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) have recently been identified in a distinct subset of pediatric-type bithalamic gliomas with a unique DNA methylation pattern.Here, we investigated an epigenetically homogeneous cohort of malignant gliomas (n = 58) distinct from other subtypes and enriched for pediatric cases and thalamic location, in comparison with this recently identified subtype of pediatric bithalamic gliomas.EGFR gene<sep>Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) form the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. The majority of GISTs are characterized by activating mutations in the KIT and PDGFRA genes (80 – 85 %). Approximately 10 – 15 % of adult (and 85 % pediatric) GISTs do not have detectable mutations in KIT or PDGFRA genes (KIT/PDGFRA non-mutated GISTs). KIT/PDGFRA non-mutated GISTs are a very heterogeneous group of tumors with alteration in SDH (SDH-deficient GIST accounting for approximately 20–40% of all<sep>Gliomas are the most common central nervous tumors in children and adolescents. However, spinal cord low-grade gliomas (sLGGs) are rare, with scarce information on tumor genomics and epigenomics. To define the molecular landscape of sLGGs, we integrated clinical data, histology, and multi-level genetic and epigenetic analyses on a consecutive cohort of 26 pediatric patients. Driver molecular alteration was found in 92% of patients (24/26). A novel variant of KIAA1549:BRAF fusion (ex10:ex9) was identified using RNA-seq in four cases. Importantly, only<sep>Ependymomas encompass a heterogeneous group of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms that occur along the entire neuroaxis. In recent years, extensive (epi-)genomic profiling efforts have identified several molecular groups of ependymoma that are characterized by distinct molecular alterations and/or patterns.

Paragangliomas are essentially the extra-adrenal counterparts of pheochromocytomas. As such this family of tumors can be subdivided into head and neck paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas and thoracic and abdominal extra-adrenal paragangliomas. Ten out of fifteen genes that contribute to the development of paragangliomas are more susceptible to the development of head and neck paragangliomas when mutated.<sep>Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a condition characterized by germ-line TP53 mutation and predisposition to various types of malignant neoplasms in childhood. We aimed to characterize spectrum of brain tumours in children associated with LFS. We gathered clinical information on LFS patients treated since 1990 at our department. Where the tissue was available, we performed molecular analysis consisting of whole genome methylation array and/or sequencing. We identified 15 LFS patients diagnosed with brain tumours; six with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), four<sep>A group of spindle cell tumors with characteristic morphologic features and recurrent gene rearrangements has recently been described. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling has emerged as a powerful tool for both robust classification of known sarcoma entities and identification of novel and clinically relevant subclasses of soft tissue tumors with characteristic alterations.

Current molecular-biological diagnostic approaches allow for more precise characterization and determination of new unique subgroups of HGG. Our aim was to identify novel and rare HGG subgroups within our institution cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our reference centre patients′ cohort consisted of 97 clinically annotated patients with HGG diagnosed between 2000 and 2021. Sanger sequencing was used for screening of the<sep>Objective: More than 20 genes associated with the development of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL) have been described so far. In previous studies, mutation rate of involved genes reached up to 30–40% depending of studied populations. Aim of the study was to search for mutations of PPGL-related genes among subjects from tertiary referral center in the Czech Republic. Design and method: Only patients with sporadic histologically proven pheochromocytoma or sympathetic paraganglioma were included. Exclusion criterion was either positive family history for<sep>The most important findings revealing pathogenesis, molecular characteristics, genotyping and targeted therapy of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are activated oncogenic mutations in KIT and PDGFRA genes. Imatinib mesylate (IM), which inhibits both KIT and PDGFRA receptors, significantly improved treatment of advanced (metastatic, recurrent, and/or inoperable) GISTs. However, in a significant number of patients the treatment fails due to the primary or secondary resistance to targeted therapy. Most common cause of secondary resistance is a presence of secondary mutations. Approximately 15%<sep>In neuroblastoma (NB), the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase can be constitutively activated through activating point mutations or genomic amplification. We studied ALK genetic alterations in high-risk (HR) patients on the HR-NBL1/SIOPEN trial to determine their frequency, correlation with clinical parameters, and prognostic impact.Diagnostic tumor samples were available from 1,092 HR-NBL1/SIOPEN patients to determine ALK amplification status (n = 330), ALK mutational profile (n = 191), or both (n = 571).Genomic ALK amplification (ALKa) was detected in 4.5% of cases (41<sep>Abstract Background Malignant astrocytic gliomas in children show a remarkable biological and clinical diversity.

The clinical manifestation of Covid-19 is manifold, cardio-respiratory symptoms and multiorgan failure being the most critical. Anosmia was reported to be an early symptom in a significant number of Covid-19 patients and is frequently the only symptom without underlying nasal congestion. Here we present neuropathological work-up of olfactory epithelium and associated olfactory nerves from two patients succumbing to Covid-19, one of which was anosmic. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with<sep>Abstract Synaptic signaling depends on ATP generated by mitochondria. Due to extensive connectivity, the striatum is especially vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction and thus requires efficient mitochondrial quality control and repair. We found that global knockout of the neuronal calcium-binding protein 2 (NECAB2) in the mouse causes loss of striatal synapses and behavioral phenotypes related to striatal dysfunction such as reduced motivation and altered sensory gating. Striatal mitochondria from Necab2 knockout mice are more abundant and smaller. They are characterized by increased respiration and superoxide production resulting in oxidative stress. This accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria is caused by a defective assembly of mitochondria with early<sep>Treatment options for patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma are limited and lack an efficient targeted drug combination that significantly increases overall and progression-free survival. In addition, targeted therapy success is hampered by the inevitable emergence of drug resistance. A thorough understanding of the molecular processes driving cancer cells’ escape mechanisms is crucial to tailor more efficient follow-up therapies. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of NRAS-mutant melanoma treated with MEK1/2 plus CDK4/6 inhibitors to decipher transcriptional transitions during the development of drug resistance. Cell lines resuming full proliferation (FACs [fast-adapting cells]) and cells that became senescent (SACs [slow-adapting cells]) over prolonged treatment were identified. The early<sep>The link between both high and low blood pressure (BP) levels and cognitive impairment in later life has been reported in several studies. The mechanisms for this link are unclear but may be related to abnormalities in brain blood flow control. Our previous work has shown that cerebral autoregulation (CA) is unimpaired in both young and older people with hypertension at rest and that ageing does not appear to impact on the increase in the cerebral blood flow response to increased metabolic demand of neurones and other cells of the nervous system due to heightened activity (Neurovascular Coupling, NVC). Nonetheless, it is plausible that<sep>Ion fluxes across the inner mitochondrial membrane control mitochondrial volume, energy production, and apoptosis. TMBIM5, a highly conserved protein with homology to putative pH-dependent ion channels, is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial cristae architecture, ATP production, and apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that overexpressed TMBIM5 can mediate mitochondrial calcium uptake. Under steady-state conditions, loss of TMBIM5 results in increased potassium and reduced proton levels in the mitochondrial matrix caused by attenuated exchange of these ions. To identify the in vivo consequences of TMBIM5 dysfunction, we generated mice carrying a mutation in the channel pore. These mutant mice display increased embryonic or perinatal lethality and<sep>We provide in this paper a comprehensive comparison of various transfer learning strategies and deep learning architectures for computer-aided classification of adult-type diffuse gliomas. We evaluate the generalizability of out-of-domain ImageNet representations for a target domain of histopathological images, and study the impact of in-domain adaptation using self-supervised and multi-task learning approaches for pretraining the models using the medium-to-large scale datasets of histopathological images. A semi-supervised learning approach is furthermore proposed, where the fine-tuned models are utilized to predict the labels of unannotated regions of the whole slide images (WSI). The models are subsequently retrained using the ground-truth labels and weak labels determined in<sep>Understanding and classifying inherent tumor heterogeneity is a multimodal approach, which can be undertaken at the genetic, biochemical, or morphological level, among others. Optical spectral methods such as Raman spectroscopy aim at rapid and non-destructive tissue analysis, where each spectrum generated reflects the individual molecular composition of an examined spot within a (heterogenous) tissue sample. Using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods as well as a solid database of Raman spectra of native glioblastoma samples, we succeed not only in distinguishing explicit tumor areas—vital tumor tissue and necrotic tumor tissue can correctly be predicted with an accuracy of 76%—but also in<sep>In recent years, Raman spectroscopy has been more and more frequently applied to address research questions in neuroscience. As a non-destructive technique based on inelastic scattering of photons, it can be used for a wide spectrum of applications including neurooncological tumor diagnostics or analysis of misfolded protein aggregates involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Progress in the technical development of this method allows for an increasingly detailed analysis of biological samples and may therefore open new fields of applications. The goal of our review is to provide an introduction into Raman scattering, its practical usage and also commonly associated pitfalls. Furthermore, intraoperative assessment of tumor recurrence<sep>Synaptic signaling depends on ATP generated by mitochondria. Dysfunctional mitochondria shift the redox balance towards a more oxidative environment. Due to extensive connectivity, the striatum is especially vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that neuronal calcium-binding protein 2 (NECAB2) plays a role in striatal function and mitochondrial homeostasis. NECAB2 is a predominantly endosomal striatal protein which partially colocalizes with mitochondria. This colocalization is enhanced by mild oxidative stress. Global knockout of Necab2 in the mouse results in increased superoxide levels, increased DNA oxidation and reduced levels of the antioxidant glutathione which correlates with an altered mitochondrial shape and function. Striatal mitochondria from Necab2 knockout<sep>Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving pandemic caused by the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2. Clinically manifest central nervous system symptoms have been described in COVID-19 patients and could be the consequence of commonly associated vascular pathology, but the detailed neuropathological sequelae remain largely unknown. A total of six cases, all positive for Sars-CoV-2, showed evidence of cerebral petechial hemorrhages and microthrombi at autopsy. Two out of six patients showed an elevated risk for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy according to current criteria and were excluded from further analysis. In the remaining four patients, the hemorrhages were most prominent at the grey and white matter junction of<sep>The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) was originally described as a master regulator of antioxidant cellular response, but in the time since, numerous important biological functions linked to cell survival, cellular detoxification, metabolism, autophagy, proteostasis, inflammation, immunity, and differentiation have been attributed to this pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates hundreds of genes. After 40 years of in-depth research and key discoveries, NRF2 is now at the center of a vast regulatory network, revealing NRF2 signalling as increasingly complex. It is widely recognized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in human physiological and pathological processes such as ageing, obesity, diabetes,<sep>H3K27M mutant (mut) diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a lethal cancer with no effective cure. The glycosphingolipids (GSL) metabolism is altered in these tumors and could be exploited to develop new therapies. We tested the effect of the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (GSI) miglustat and eliglustat on cell proliferation, alone or in combination with temozolomide or ionizing radiation. Miglustat was included in the therapy protocol of two pediatric patients. The effect of H3.3K27 trimethylation on GSL composition was analyzed in ependymoma. GSI reduced the expression of the ganglioside GD2 in a concentration and time-dependent manner and increased the expression of ceramide, ceramide 1-phosphate, sphingosine, and<sep>Neuroblastoma (NBL) and medulloblastoma (MB) are aggressive pediatric cancers which can benefit from therapies targeting gangliosides. Therefore, we compared the ganglioside profile of 9 MB and 14 NBL samples by thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry. NBL had the highest expression of GD2 (median 0.54 nmol GD2/mg protein), and also expressed complex gangliosides. GD2-low samples expressed GD1a and were more differentiated. MB mainly expressed GD2 (median 0.032 nmol GD2/mg protein) or GM3. Four sonic hedgehog-activated (SHH) as well as one group 4 and one group 3 MBs were GD2-positive. Two group 3 MB samples were GD2-negative but GM3-positive. N-glycolyl neuraminic acid-containing GM3 was neither<sep>In a healthy physiological context, astrocytes are multitasking cells contributing to central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, defense, and immunity. In cell culture or rodent models of age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), numerous studies have shown that astrocytes can adopt neurotoxic phenotypes that could enhance disease progression. Chronic inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, unbalanced phagocytosis, or alteration of their core physiological roles are the main manifestations of their detrimental states. However, if astrocytes are directly involved in brain deterioration by exerting neurotoxic functions in patients with NDDs is still controversial. The large spectrum of NDDs, with often overlapping<sep>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has limitations in identifying underlying tissue pathology, which is relevant for neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke or brain tumours. However, there are no standardized methods for correlating MRI features with histopathology. Thus, here we aimed to develop and validate a tool that can facilitate the correlation of brain MRI features to corresponding histopathology. For this, we designed the Brainbox, a waterproof and MRI-compatible 3D printed container with an integrated 3D coordinate system. We used the Brainbox to acquire post-mortem ex vivo MRI of eight human brains, fresh and formalin-fixed, and correlated focal imaging features to histopathology using the<sep>BackgroundVirchow-Robin spaces (VRS) have been associated with neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. However, it remains uncertain to what degree non-dilated or dilated VRS reflect specific features of neuroinflammatory pathology. Thus, we aimed at investigating the clinical relevance of VRS as imaging biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS) and to correlate VRS to their histopathologic signature.MethodsIn a cohort study comprising 142 MS patients and 30 control subjects, we assessed the association of non-dilated and dilated VRS to clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes. Findings were corroborated in a validation cohort comprising 63 MS patients. Brain blocks from 6 MS patients and 3 non-MS controls were histopathologically processed<sep>Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), assumed to cause antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), are notorious for their heterogeneity in targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. The persistent presence of Lupus anticoagulant and/or aPL against cardiolipin and/or β2-glycoprotein I have been shown to be independent risk factors for vascular thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity in APS. aPL production is thought to be triggered by–among other factors–viral infections, though infection-associated aPL have mostly been considered non-pathogenic. Recently, the potential pathogenicity of infection-associated aPL has gained momentum since an increasing number of patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been described with coagulation abnormalities and hyperinflammation, together with the<sep>The ganglioside GD2 is an important target in childhood cancer. Nevertheless, the only therapy targeting GD2 that is approved to date is the monoclonal antibody dinutuximab, which is used in the therapy of neuroblastoma. The relevance of GD2 as a target in other tumor entities remains to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed the expression of GD2 in different pediatric tumor entities by flow cytometry and tested two approaches for targeting GD2. H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (H3K27M-mutant DMG) samples showed the highest expression of GD2 with all cells strongly positive for the antigen. Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) samples also showed high expression, but displayed intra- and<sep>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important disease with a high incidence among patients admitted to intensive care units. Over the last decades, the survival of critically ill patients has improved; however, cognitive deficits are among the long-term sequelae. We hypothesize that acute lung injury leads to upregulation of cerebral cytokine synthesis.After approval of the institutional and animal care committee, 20 male pigs were randomized to one of three groups: (1) Lung injury by oleic acid injection (OAI), (2) ventilation only (CTR) or (3) untreated. We compared neuronal numbers, proportion of neurons with markers for apoptosis, activation state of Iba-1 stained microglia cells<sep>First-line drug in the treatment of glioblastoma, the most severe brain cancer, is temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA-methylating agent that induces the critical damage O6-methylguanine (O6MeG). This lesion is cytotoxic through the generation of mismatch repair-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which trigger apoptotic pathways. Previously, we showed that O6MeG also induces cellular senescence (CSEN). Here, we show that TMZ-induced CSEN is a late response which has similar kinetics to apoptosis, but at a fourfold higher level. CSEN cells show a high amount of DSBs, which are located outside of telomeres, a high level of ROS and oxidized DNA damage (8-oxo-guanine), and sustained activation of the<sep>Aircraft noise induces vascular and cerebral inflammation and oxidative stress causing hypertension and cardiovascular/cerebral dysfunction. With the present studies, we sought to determine the role of myeloid cells in the vascular vs. cerebral consequences of exposure to aircraft noise. Toxin-mediated ablation of lysozyme M+ (LysM+) myeloid cells was performed in LysMCreiDTR mice carrying a cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor. In the last 4d of toxin treatment, the animals were exposed to noise at maximum and mean sound pressure levels of 85 and 72 dB(A), respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed accumulation of CD45+, CD11b+, F4/80+, and Ly6G-Ly6C+ cells in the aortas of noise-exposed mice, which was<sep>Arterial hypertension is the most important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Recently, aircraft noise has been shown to be associated with elevated blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Here, we investigated the potential exacerbated cardiovascular effects of aircraft noise in combination with experimental arterial hypertension. C57BL/6J mice were infused with 0.5 mg/kg/d of angiotensin II for 7 days, exposed to aircraft noise for 7 days at a maximum sound pressure level of 85 dB(A) and a mean sound pressure level of 72 dB(A), or subjected to both stressors. Noise and angiotensin II increased blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and<sep>Abstract Heterozygous variants in the glucocerebrosidase GBA1 gene are an increasingly recognized risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Due to the GBAP1 pseudogene, which shares 96% sequence homology with the GBA1 coding region, accurate variant calling by array-based or short-read sequencing methods remains a major challenge in understanding the genetic landscape of GBA1 -associated PD. We analyzed 660 patients with PD, 100 patients with Parkinsonism and 808 healthy controls from the Luxembourg Parkinson’s study, sequenced using amplicon-based long-read DNA sequencing technology. We found that 12.1% (77/637) of PD patients carried GBA1 variants, with 10.5% (67/637) of them carrying known pathogenic variants (including severe, mild,<sep>Abstract Glioblastoma is the most prevalent and aggressive malignant tumor of the central nervous system. With a median overall survival of only one year, glioblastoma patients have a particularly poor prognosis, highlighting a clear need for novel therapeutic strategies to target this disease. Transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases (tCDK), which phosphorylate key residues of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) c-terminal domain (CTD), play a major role in sustaining aberrant transcriptional programs that are key to development and maintenance of cancer cells. Here, we show that either pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of the tCDKs, CDK12 and CDK13, markedly reduces both the proliferation and migratory capacity of glioma<sep>Gaucher's disease is characterized by intralysosomal storage of glucosylceramide due to a genetic deficiency of the enzyme glucosylceramidase. Gaucher’s disease can be treated using eliglustat and miglustat, two inhibitors of the glucosylceramide synthase (GSL). The conversion of ceramide to glucosylceramide is one of the first steps in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids which can be therefore inhibited by eliglustat and miglustat. Glycosphingolipids play a major role in brain development and have been involved in the pathology of brain tumors. Here we analyzed the glycosphingolipids composition and the effect of eliglustat in diffuse midline glioma (DMG), one of the deadliest cancers in the pediatric population. We<sep>Abstract H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (H3K27M-mutant DMG) is a rare malignant brain tumour entity in children and adults with a median overall survival of around 12 months. Genomic and proteomic analysis may help to identify new target structures, however not all relevant targets are covered by these analyses. Glycosphingolipids and particularly gangliosides play a major role in brain development and have been involved in the pathology of brain tumours. The conversion of ceramide to glucosylceramide via glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) is one of the first steps in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids. Therefore, targeting GCS will inhibit their synthesis. Here we analysed the glycosphingolipids composition and<sep>Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a primary cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma with unfavourable prognosis for patients with advanced stages of the disease. Refractory disease and advanced‐stage disease require systemic therapy. We report on a rare case of an atypical predominantly CD8+ folliculotropic MF, a subtype of MF with poorer prognosis, in a 59‐year‐old woman. She was initially diagnosed with MF restricted to the skin, of T3N0M0B0/stage IIB according to the current World Health Organization–European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer classification. First‐line treatment with local percutaneous radiotherapy in combination with systemic interferon alfa‐2a resulted in complete remission.

Several groups have reported elevated levels of criteria and non-criteria antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), assumed to cause APS, during acute or post-acute COVID-19. However, disease heterogeneity of COVID-19 is accompanied by heterogeneity in molecular signatures, including aberrant cytokine profiles and an increased occurrence of autoantibodies. Moreover, little is known about the association between autoantibodies and the clinical events. Here, we first aim to characterise the antiphospholipid antibody, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, and the cytokine profiles in a diverse collective of<sep>Spinal arachnoid web (SAW) is a rare condition characterized by focal thickening of the arachnoid membrane causing displacement and compression of the spinal cord with progressive symptoms and neurological deficits.

Moderate hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and increases in oxidative stress are associated with exposure to the novel cardiovascular risk, noise pollution. Since we have previously established a role for myelomonocytes (LysM+ cells) in the deleterious effects of noise exposure, we hypothesized that partial ablation of these cells would protect from cardiovascular consequences. Methods LysM+ immune cells were depleted with diphtheria toxin (DTX) in LysMCre+/-iDTR+/- mice for 6 days prior to noise exposure (mean SPL; 72 dBA) and 4 days concurrently.

The development of hypertension is multifactorial and determined by dietary, environmental, and genetic factors, complicating the characterization and treatment of the disease. We have previously established development of hypertension and an increase in inflammatory parameters following acute noise exposure [Münzel et al. Eur Heart J 2017; Kröller‐Schön et al.

The main objective of this review is to delineate and discuss the critical factors involved in the liquid target production of radiometals, including type of salt solution, solution composition, beam energy, beam current, the effect of irradiation duration (length of irradiation) and challenges posed by in-target chemistry in relation with irradiation parameters. We also summarize the optimal parameters for the production of various radiometals in liquid targets. Additionally, we discuss the future prospects of PET radiometals production in the liquid targets for academic research and clinical applications. Significant emphasis has been given to the production of 68Ga using liquid targets due to the growing demand for 68Ga labeled PSMA vectors, [68Ga]- Ga-DOTATATE, [68Ga]Ga-DOTANOC and some upcoming 68Ga labeled radiopharmaceuticals.

There is an unmet clinical need for a blood‐brain barrier (BBB) permeable positron emission tomography (PET) probe for imaging of GSK‐3α/β in the brain to understand the pathogenesis of AD. Herein, we synthesized two PET probes, [ 18 F]F‐CNBI and [ 18 F]F‐CNPIFE, and evaluated their BBB permeability and affinity towards GSK‐3α/β. [ 19 F]F‐CNPIFE showed higher in‐vitro binding towards GSK‐3α/β (IC 50 =19.4±2.5 nM; n=3, for GSK‐3α, IC 50 =19.4±3.8 nM; n=3, for GSK‐3β) compared to [ 19 F]F‐CNBI (IC 50 =107.6±26.0 nM; n=4, for GSK‐3α, IC 50 =105.3±18.2 nM; n=3, for GSK‐3β). [ 18 F]F‐CNPIFE showed 9.5‐fold higher brain uptake than [ 18 F]F‐CNBI, in normal FVB/NJ mice, which was increased by additional 1.5‐fold on co‐administration of [ 19 F]F‐CNPIFE with respect to [ 18 F]F‐CNBI. Overall, [ 18 F]F‐CNPIFE is a<sep>T cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) have shown unprecedented results in pivotal clinical trials for patients with B cell malignancies or multiple myeloma (MM). However, numerous obstacles limit the efficacy and prohibit the widespread use of CAR T cell therapies due to poor trafficking and infiltration into tumor sites as well as lack of persistence in vivo. Moreover, life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity, are major concerns. Efficient and sensitive imaging and tracking of CAR T cells enables the evaluation of T cell trafficking, expansion, and in vivo characterization and allows the development of strategies to overcome the current limitations of CAR T cell therapy. This paper describes the methodology for incorporating the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) in CAR T cells and for CAR T cell imaging using [18F]tetrafluoroborate-positron emission tomography ([18F]TFB-PET) in preclinical models. The methods described in this protocol can be applied<sep>Abstract Introduction Radiolabeling of stem cells with a positron emitting radioisotope represents a major advancement in regenerative biotherapy enabling non-invasive imaging. To assess the value of such an approach in a clinically relevant scenario, the tolerability and therapeutic aptitude of [89Zr]zirconium-p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine ([89Zr]Zr-DBN) labeled human cardiopoietic stem cells (CPs) were evaluated in a model of ischemic heart failure. Methods and results [89Zr]Zr-DBN based radiolabeling of human CPs yielded [89Zr]Zr-DBN-CPs with radioactivity yield of 0.70 ± 0.20 MBq/106 cells and excellent label stability. Compared to unlabeled cell counterparts, [89Zr]Zr-DBN-CPs maintained morphology, viability, and proliferation capacity with characteristic expression of mesodermal and pro-cardiogenic transcription factors defining the cardiopoietic phenotype. Administered in chronically infarcted murine hearts, [89Zr]Zr-DBN-CPs salvaged cardiac pump failure, documented by improved left ventricular ejection fraction not inferior to unlabeled CPs and notably superior to infarcted hearts without cell treatment. Conclusion The present study establishes that [89Zr]Zr-DBN labeling does not compromise stem cell<sep>Four tris-bidentate catecholamide (CAM) ligands were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as ligands for radiolabeling of gallium-68 for positron emission tomography (PET). Three of those ligands, 2,2-Glu-CAM, 3,3-Glu-CAM, and TREN-bisGlyGlu-CAM, incorporate ligand caps that contain a pendant carboxylic group for further conjugation to targeting moieties. The acyclic ligands all exhibited high (>80%) radiolabeling yields after short reaction times (<10 min) at room temperature, a distinct advantage over macrocyclic analogues that display slower kinetics. The stabilities of the four GaIII complexes are comparable to or higher than those of other acyclic ligands used for gallium-68 PET imaging, such as desferrioxamine, with pGa values ranging from 21 to >24, although the functionalizable ligands are less stable than the parent GaIII-TREN-CAM. In vivo imaging studies and ex vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies indicate that the parent [68Ga]Ga-TREN-CAM is stable in vivo but is rapidly cleared in <15 min, probably via a renal pathway. The rapid<sep>Stem cell and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are emerging as promising therapeutics for organ regeneration and as immunotherapy for various cancers. Despite significant progress having been made in these areas, there is still more to be learned to better understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the administered therapeutic cells in the living system. For noninvasive, in vivo tracking of cells with positron emission tomography (PET), a novel [89Zr]Zr-p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine ([89Zr]Zr-DBN)-mediated cell radiolabeling method has been developed utilizing 89Zr (t1/2 78.4 h). The present protocol describes a [89Zr]Zr-DBN-mediated, ready-to-use, radiolabeling synthon for direct radiolabeling of variety of cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, lineage-guided cardiopoietic stem cells, liver regenerating hepatocytes, white blood cells, melanoma cells, and dendritic cells. The developed methodology enables noninvasive PET imaging of cell trafficking for up to 7 days post-administration without affecting the nature or the function of the radiolabeled cells. Additionally, this protocol describes a stepwise method<sep>Noninvasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of luciferase-expressing tumor cells has advanced pre-clinical evaluation of cancer therapies. Yet despite its successes, BLI is limited by poor spatial resolution and signal penetration, making it unusable for deep tissue or large animal imaging and preventing precise anatomical localization or signal quantification. To refine pre-clinical BLI methods and circumvent these limitations, we compared and ultimately combined BLI with tomographic, quantitative imaging of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). To this end, we generated tumor cell lines expressing luciferase, NIS, or both reporters, and established tumor models in mice. BLI provided sensitive early detection of tumors and relatively easy monitoring of disease progression. However, spatial resolution was poor, and as the tumors grew, deep thoracic tumor signals were massked by overwhelming surface signals from superficial tumors. In contrast, NIS-expressing tumors were readily distinguished and precisely localized at all tissue depths by positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon<sep>Immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) is efficacious in various solid and hematologic malignancies. However, the response rate to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is only 15-35%. To obtain optimal clinical response to ICI therapies, a reliable assessment of tumor PD-L1 expression is needed to select appropriate patients, and a non-invasive imaging-based assessment of PD-L1 expression is critically needed. Although radiolabeled PET probes based on PD-L1 targeted therapeutic antibodies (e.g. atezolizumab) have shown encouraging results, there is concern that residual therapeutic antibody may compete for binding with the radiotracer thereby compromising imaging studies that follow treatment.In this study, we used novel anti-PD-L1-B11 clone antibody known to bind to a different epitope of PD-L1 than the therapeutic antibodies to avoid potential saturation effects. The anti-PD-L1-B11 clone was radiolabeled with zirconium-89 and evaluated to detect PD-L1 expression in various in vitro and in vivo cancer model systems in comparison with [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS-atezolizumab. In vitro binding parameters<sep>Metal ion dyshomeostasis and disparate levels of biometals like zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and selenium (Se) have been implicated as a potential causative factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this study, we have enrolled 129 children (aged 2-4 years) in North America, of which 64 children had a diagnosis of ASD and 65 were controls. Hair, nail, and blood samples were collected and quantitatively analyzed for Zn, Cu and Se using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Of the analyzed biometals, serum Se (116.83 ± 14.84 mcg/mL) was found to be significantly lower in male ASD cases compared to male healthy controls (128.21 ± 9.11 mcg/mL; p < 0.005). A similar trend was found for nail Se levels in ASD (1.01 ± 0.15 mcg/mL) versus that of controls (1.11 ± 0.17 mcg/mL) with a p-value of 0.0132 using a stratified Wilcoxon rank sum testing. The level of Se in ASD<sep>Abstract The effectiveness of cell-based therapies to treat liver failure is limited by the diseased liver environment. Herein we provide preclinical proof-of-concept for the treatment of liver failure through hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes in a large-animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic liver disease caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. FAH-deficient pigs received autologous hepatocyte transplantation into mesenteric lymph nodes after ex vivo transduction with a lentiviral vector carrying the pig Fah gene. Hepatocytes showed early (6 hour) and durable (8 month) engraftment in lymph nodes, with reproduction of vascular and hepatic microarchitecture. Subsequently, hepatocytes migrated to and repopulated the native diseased liver. The corrected cells generated enough liver mass to clinically ameliorate disease as early as 97 days post-transplantation, with complete normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Integration site analysis defined the corrected hepatocytes in the liver as a subpopulation of hepatocytes<sep>Due to the advent of various biologics like antibodies, proteins, cells, viruses, and extracellular vesicles as biomarkers for disease diagnosis, progression, and as therapeutics, there exists a need to have a simple and ready to use radiolabeling synthon to enable noninvasive imaging trafficking studies. Previously, we reported [89Zr]zirconium-p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine ([89Zr]Zr-DBN) as a synthon for the radiolabeling of biologics to allow PET imaging of cell trafficking. In this study, we focused on improving the molar activity (Am) of [89Zr]Zr-DBN, by enhancing 89Zr production on a low-energy cyclotron and developing a new reverse phase HPLC method to purify [89Zr]Zr-DBN. To enhance 89Zr production, a new solid target was designed, and production yield was optimized by varying, thickness of yttrium foil, beam current, irradiation duration and proton beam energy. After optimization, 4.78±0.33 GBq (129.3±8.9 mCi) of 89Zr was produced at 40 µA for 180 min (3 h) proton irradiation decay corrected to the end of<sep>Although chimeric antigen receptor T (CART)-cell therapy has been successful in treating certain hematologic malignancies, wider adoption of CART-cell therapy is limited because of minimal activity in solid tumors and development of life-threatening toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS). There is a lack of a robust, clinically relevant imaging platform to monitor in vivo expansion and trafficking to tumor sites. To address this, we utilized the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) as a platform to image and track CART cells. We engineered CD19-directed and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CART cells to express NIS (NIS+CART19 and NIS+BCMA-CART, respectively) and tested the sensitivity of 18F-TFB-PET to detect trafficking and expansion in systemic and localized tumor models and in a CART-cell toxicity model. NIS+CART19 and NIS+BCMA-CART cells were generated through dual transduction with two vectors and demonstrated exclusive 125I uptake in vitro. 18F-TFB-PET detected NIS+CART cells in vivo to a sensitivity level of 40,000 cells.<sep>&lt;div&gt;Abstract&lt;p&gt;Although chimeric antigen receptor T (CART)–cell therapy has been successful in treating certain hematologic malignancies, wider adoption of CART-cell therapy is limited because of minimal activity in solid tumors and development of life-threatening toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Whereas Zn 2+ deficiency can cause cognitive immune or metabolic dysfunction and infertility, excess Zn 2+ is nephrotoxic. As for other ions and solutes, Zn 2+ is moved into and out of cells by specific membrane transporters: ZnT, Zip, and NRAMP/DMT proteins. ZIP10 is reported to be localized at the apical membrane of renal proximal tubules in rats, where it is believed to play a role in Zn 2+ import. Renal regulation of Zn 2+ is of particular interest in light of growing evidence that Zn 2+ may play a role in kidney stone formation. The objective of this study was to show that ZIP10 homologs transport Zn 2+ , as well as ZIP10, kidney localization across species. We cloned ZIP10 from dog, human,<sep>The ability of heart and skeletal muscle (SM) to switch between fat and carbohydrate oxidation is of high interest in the study of metabolic diseases and exercise physiology. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the glucose analog 2-[ 18 F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose ( 18 F-FDG) provides a noninvasive means to quantitate glucose metabolic rates. However, evaluation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rates by PET has been limited by the lack of a suitable FAO probe. We have developed a metabolically trapped oleate analog, ( Z)-18-[ 18 F]fluoro-4-thia-octadec-9-enoate ( 18 F-FTO), and investigated the feasibility of using 18 F-FTO and 18 F-FDG to measure FAO and glucose uptake, respectively, in heart and SM of rats in vivo. To enhance the metabolic rates in SM, the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle was electrically stimulated in fasted rats for 30 min before and 30 min following radiotracer injection. The responses of radiotracer uptake patterns to pharmacological inhibition<sep>Aberrant insulin signaling has been considered one of the risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has drawn considerable attention from the research community to further study its role in AD pathophysiology. Herein, we describe the development of an insulin-based novel positron emission tomography (PET) probe, [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-insulin, to noninvasively study the role of insulin in AD. The developed PET probe [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-insulin showed a significantly higher uptake (0.396 ± 0.055 SUV) in the AD mouse brain compared to the normal (0.140 ± 0.027 SUV) mouse brain at 5 min post injection and also showed a similar trend at 10, 15, and 20 min post injection. In addition, [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-insulin was found to have a differential uptake in various brain regions at 30 min post injection. Among the brain regions, the cortex, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum showed a significantly higher standard uptake value (SUV) of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-insulin in AD mice as<sep>1231 Introduction: The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) protein mediates transport of iodide into cells, and provides a key role in diagnosis and treatment of well-differentiated thyroid cancers. Surprisingly, breast cancer has recently been found to express hNIS in more than 75% of all sampled tumors 1. There is potential for NIS-mediated radiotracer imaging and radioiodide therapy in breast cancer, as it has been performed for decades in thyroid cancer under the same mechanisms. Some pretreatment agents such as retinoids alone or in combination with DEX have been used to enhance NIS expression and activity in breast cancer cells 2-4. [18F]tetrafluoroborate ([18F] TFB) is a positron emission tomography (PET) iodide-analog radiotracer that enables imaging of NIS-mediated transport into the cell, which provides higher resolution over planar scans and SPECT. Herein, we evaluated [18F] TFB as a radioactive imaging agent in MCF-7 breast cancer cells in comparison with [123I], and [99mTc] pertechnetate and examined<sep>To optimize 68Ga production using a liquid cyclotron target, investigations were performed to compare production yields using different concentrations of [68Zn]Zn(NO3)2, nitric acid, and irradiation parameters. Different concentrations of [68Zn]Zn(NO3)2 (0.6 M, 1.2 M and 1.42 M) in varying normality of nitric acid (0.8–1.5 N) were prepared and irradiated with protons (incident energy ~14 MeV) using a BMLT-2 liquid target at different beam currents (30–50 μA) and irradiation times (30–60 min). The 68Ga production and saturation yields were calculated and compared. [68Ga]GaCl3 was isolated using in-house developed hydroxamate resin and optimized for routine application. Recycling of [68Zn]Zn(NO3)2 from the recovered target solution was also investigated. On increasing concentration of [68Zn]Zn(NO3)2 from 0.6 M to 1.2 M in 0.8 N nitric acid, decay corrected yield of 68Ga at EOB was found to be 1.64 GBq (44.4 mCi) and 3.37 GBq (91.0 mCi), respectively at 30 μA beam current, indicating production yield was<sep>The effectiveness of cell-based therapies to treat liver failure is often limited by the diseased liver environment. Here, we provide preclinical proof of concept for hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes as a cure for liver failure in a large-animal model with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic liver disease caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. Autologous porcine hepatocytes were transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector carrying the pig Fah gene and transplanted into mesenteric lymph nodes. Hepatocytes showed early (6 h) and durable (8 months) engraftment in lymph nodes, with reproduction of vascular and hepatic microarchitecture. Subsequently, hepatocytes migrated to and repopulated the native diseased liver. The corrected cells generated sufficient liver mass to clinically ameliorate the acute liver failure and HT1 disease as early as 97 days post-transplantation. Integration site analysis defined the corrected hepatocytes in the liver as a subpopulation of hepatocytes from lymph nodes,<sep>Noninvasive dual-imaging methods that provide an early readout on tumor permissiveness to virus infection and tumor cell death could be valuable in optimizing development of oncolytic virotherapies. Here, we have used the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and 125I radiotracer to detect infection and replicative spread of an oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in VSV-susceptible (MPC-11 tumor) versus VSV-resistant (CT26 tumor) tumors in BALB/c mice. In conjunction, tumor cell death was imaged simultaneously using technetium (99mTc)-duramycin that binds phosphatidylethanolamine in apoptotic and necrotic cells. Dual-isotope single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging showed areas of virus infection (NIS and 125I), which overlapped well with areas of tumor cell death (99mTc-duramycin imaging) in susceptible tumors. Multiple infectious foci arose early in MPC-11 tumors, which rapidly expanded throughout the tumor parenchyma over time. There was a dose-dependent increase in numbers of infectious centers and 99mTc-duramycin-positive areas with viral dose. In contrast, NIS or duramycin<sep>Endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1 (ERN1, also called IRE1A) is a sensor of the unfolded protein response that is activated in the livers of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatocytes release ceramide-enriched inflammatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) after activation of IRE1A. We studied the effects of inhibiting IRE1A on release of inflammatory EVs in mice with diet-induced steatohepatitis.C57BL/6J mice and mice with hepatocyte-specific disruption of Ire1a (IRE1αΔhep) were fed a diet high in fat, fructose, and cholesterol to induce development of steatohepatitis or a standard chow diet (controls). Some mice were given intraperitoneal injections of the IRE1A inhibitor 4μ8C. Mouse liver and primary hepatocytes were transduced with adenovirus or adeno-associated virus that expressed IRE1A. Livers were collected from mice and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays; plasma samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. EVs were derived from hepatocytes and injected intravenously into mice.

Methods: Leveraging a high production yield of 68Ga in a liquid cyclotron target (BMLT-2)1-2, we synthesized 68Ga-PSMA-HBED under cGMP using cyclotron produced 68GaCl3. A solution of 1.5 M 68Zn-nitrate in 1.2 N nitric acid was employed for proton irradiation at 40 µA current for 60 min to produce 68Ga(NO3)3. The 68Ga(NO3)3 was purified in two steps using in-house synthesized hydroxamate resin (100 mg) followed by trapping of 68Ga as [68GaCl4]- on an anion exchange resin (AG-1X-8, 400 mg) using an automated radiochemistry module (Trasis All-in-One)2-3. Finally, 68GaCl3 was eluted in 2 mL of water and transferred to a reactor vial preloaded with 5 ug of PSMA-HBED precursor in 3M sodium acetate. Radiolabeling was carried out at 100 oC for 10 min followed by trap-and-release from a C-18 Sep-Pak<sep>The objectives of the present work were to optimize and validate the synthesis and stability of 14(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([18F]FTHA) and 16-[18F]fluoro-4-thia-palmitic acid ([18F]FTP) under cGMP conditions for clinical applications. Benzyl-14-(R,S)-tosyloxy-6-thiaheptadecanoate and methyl 16-bromo-4-thia-palmitate were used as precursors for the synthesis of [18F]FTHA and [18F]FTP, respectively. For comparison, a fatty acid analog lacking a thia-substitution, 16-[18F]fluoro-palmitic acid ([18F]FP), was synthesized from the precursor methyl 16-bromo-palmitate. A standard nucleophilic reaction using cryptand (Kryptofix/K222, 8.1 mg), potassium carbonate (K2CO3, 4.0 mg) and 18F-fluoride were employed for the 18F-labeling and potassium hydroxide (0.8 M) was used for the post-labeling ester hydrolysis. The final products were purified via reverse phase semi-preparative HPLC and concentrated via trap and release on a C-18 plus solid phase extraction cartridge. The radiochemical purities of the [18F]fluorothia fatty acids and [18F]FP were examined over a period of 4 h post-synthesis using an analytical HPLC. All the syntheses were optimized in an<sep>1486 Introduction: Immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has been found to be efficacious in numerous solid & hematologic malignancies. However, its response rate to therapy is only 15-35%. In order to optimize ICI therapies, a reliable assessment of PD-L1 expression is needed for selecting patients for ICI treatment & to assess potential alteration of PD-L1 expression during & post-therapy conferring resistance. Immunohistochemistry quantification of PD-L1 following biopsy is severely limited by random tissue sampling & inherent heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression within & among metastatic lesions. A non-invasive imaging based assessment of PD-L1 expression is critically needed. Although radiolabeled PET probes based on PD-L1 targeted therapeutic antibodies, like Atezolizumab have shown encouraging results, slow blood clearance (half-life = 27 days for therapeutic Atezolizumab) complicates the use of [89Zr]Zr-Atezolizumab as imaging probe. Therefore, alternate PD-L1 imaging probes based on antibodies with faster blood clearance could be advantageous.

To address this, we introduce an experimental design to match inter-platform biological signals, hence revealing the technological discrepancy, and then develop a deconvolution framework called DeMixSC using the better-matched, i.e., benchmark, data. Built upon a novel weighted nonnegative least-squares framework, DeMixSC identifies and adjusts genes with high technological discrepancy and aligns the benchmark data with large patient<sep>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness, affecting 200 million people worldwide. To identify genes that could be targeted for treatment, we created a molecular atlas at different stages of AMD. Our resource is comprised of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and DNA methylation microarrays from bulk macular retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid of clinically phenotyped normal and AMD donor eyes (n = 85), single-nucleus RNA-seq (164,399 cells), and single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq (125,822 cells) from the retina, RPE, and<sep>Single-cell sequencing has revolutionized the scale and resolution of molecular profiling of tissues and organs. Here, we present an integrated multimodal reference atlas of the most accessible portion of the mammalian central nervous system, the retina. We compiled around 2.4 million cells from 55 donors, including 1.4 million unpublished data points, to create a comprehensive human retina cell atlas (HRCA) of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility, unveiling over 110 types. Engaging the retina community, we annotated each cluster, refined the Cell Ontology for<sep>Retinal disorders are a group of ocular diseases whose onset is associated with a number of aberrant molecular and cellular processes or physical damages that affect retinal structure and function resulting in neural and vascular degeneration in the retina. Current research has primarily focused on delaying retinal disease with minimal success in preventing or reversing neuronal degeneration.

All these conditions are complex, meaning that environmental factors, genetic factors, and their interactions play a role in disease pathophysiology. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS), and studies on twins demonstrate the genetic/hereditary component to these complex diseases, including AMD, this contribution is much less than 100%. Moreover,<sep>Purpose: To describe the clinical, histological, electrophysiologic, and multimodal imaging findings in a 76-year-old patient with aceruloplasminemia with low genetic risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Clinical examination as well as multimodal imaging including fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy imaging, and full-field and multifocal electroretinography were performed on one patient with aceruloplasminemia.

This review captures the landscape of understanding of AD pathology, diagnostics, and current therapies. Two major mechanisms direct AD pathology: (1) accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaque and (2) tau-derived neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The most common variants in the Aβ pathway in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 are largely responsible for early-onset AD (EOAD), while MAPT, APOE, TREM2 and<sep>Abstract Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous disease and the main cause of vision loss within the group of inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). IRDs are a group of rare disorders caused by mutations in one or more of over 280 genes which ultimately result in blindness. Modifier genes play a key role in modulating disease phenotypes, and mutations in them can affect disease outcomes, rate of progression, and severity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the nuclear hormone receptor 2 family e,<sep>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the world's leading cause of blindness in the aging population. Although the clinical stages and forms of AMD have been elucidated, more specific prognostic tools are required to determine when patients with early and intermediate AMD will progress into the advanced stages of AMD. Another challenge in the field has been the appropriate development of therapies for intermediate AMD and advanced atrophic AMD. After numerous negative clinical trials, an anti-C5 agent<sep>Globally, women experience a greater burden of eye disease as compared to men. Women around the world face different obstacles in maintaining both healthy vision and prevention of vision loss. Understanding women’s eye health can be a challenge because risk can vary based on demographic, environmental, genetic, and social factors. Women also experience varying risk for visual impairment in different stages of their lives such as pregnancy, menopause, and post-menopause. Moreover, women experience a greater risk of visual impairment because of where<sep>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of blindness in people under the age of 65. Unfortunately, the current screening process for DR restricts the population that can be evaluated and the disease goes undetected until irreversible damage occurs. Herein, we aimed to evaluate homocysteine (Hcy) as a biomarker for DR screening. Hcy levels were measured by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) and immunolocalization methods in the serum, vitreous and retina of diabetic patients as well as in serum and retina<sep>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss. Elevated homocysteine (Hcy) (Hyperhomocysteinemia) (HHcy) has been reported in AMD. We previously reported that HHcy induces AMD-like features. This study suggests that N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a mechanism for HHcy-induced AMD. Serum Hcy and cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) were assessed by ELISA. The involvement of NMDAR in Hcy-induced AMD features was evaluated (1) in vitro using ARPE-19 cells, primary RPE isolated from HHcy mice (CBS), and<sep>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a blinding condition affecting preterm infants, is an interruption of retinal vascular maturation that is incomplete when born preterm. Although ROP demonstrates delayed onset following preterm birth, representing a window for therapeutic intervention, there are no curative or preventative measures available for this condition. The in utero environment, including placental function, is increasingly recognized for contributions to preterm infant disease risk. The current study identified a protective association between acute placental inflammation and preterm infant ROP development using<sep>Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common form of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH is a complex genetic disorder, assigned to three clinical subtypes differing in onset, course and severity, with USH1 being the most severe. Rodent USH1 models do not reflect the ocular phenotype observed in human patients to date; hence, little is known about the pathophysiology of USH1 in the human eye. One of the USH1 genes, USH1C, exhibits extensive alternative splicing and encodes numerous harmonin protein isoforms that function<sep>Abstract Multiomic profiling of single cells by sequencing is a powerful technique for investigating cellular diversity in complex biological systems. Although the existing droplet-based microfluidic methods have advanced single-cell sequencing, they produce a plethora of cell-free droplets and underutilize barcoding capacities due to their low cell concentration prerequisites. Meanwhile, combinatorial indexing on microplates can index cells in a more effective way; however, it requires time-consuming and laborious protocols involving multiple splitting and pooling steps.

Rods are dominant in the peripheral retina, whereas cones are enriched in the macula, which is responsible for central vision and visual acuity. Macular degenerations affect vision the most and are currently incurable. Here we report the generation, transcriptome profiling, and functional validation of cone-rich human retinal organoids differentiated from hESCs using an improved retinal differentiation system.

CODA is characterized by a variably excavated optic nerve appearance such as morning glory, optic pit, atypical coloboma, and severe optic nerve cupping. Four affected and fourteen unaffected family members of a multi-generation pedigree were phenotyped by visual acuity, intraocular pressure, dilated fundus examination, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography.<sep>Purpose: Current understanding of local disease pathophysiology in AMD is limited. Analysis of the human disease-affected tissue is most informative, as gene expression, expressed quantitative trait loci, microenvironmental, and epigenetic changes can be tissue, cell type, and location specific. Development of a novel translational treatment and prevention strategies particularly for earlier forms of AMD are needed, although access to human ocular tissue analysis is challenging. We present a standardized protocol to study rapidly processed postmortem donor eyes for molecular biochemical and genomic<sep>Abstract Background Systematic characterization of how genetic variation modulates gene regulation in a cell type specific context is essential for understanding complex traits. To address this question, we profiled gene expression and chromatin state of cells from healthy retinae of 20 human donors with a single-cell multiomics approach, and performed genomic sequencing. Results We mapped single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTLs), single-cell caQTL (sc-caQTL), single-cell allelic specific chromatin accessibility (sc-ASCA) and single-cell allelic specific expression (sc-ASE) in major retinal cell types. By integrating these results,<sep>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a blinding aberrancy of retinal vascular maturation in preterm infants. Despite delayed onset after preterm birth, representing a window for therapeutic intervention, we cannot prevent or cure ROP blindness. A natural form of ROP protection exists in the setting of early-onset maternal preeclampsia, though is not well characterized. As ischemia is central feature in both ROP and preeclampsia, we hypothesized that angiogenesis mediators may underlie this protection. To test our hypothesis we analyzed peripheral blood expression of<sep>Abstract Background: Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in old people. Elevated homocysteine (Hcy), known as Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) was reported in association with AMD. We previously reported that HHcy induces AMD like features. The current study suggests activation of N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells as a mechanism for HHcy-induced AMD. Serum Hcy and cystathione-β-synthase enzyme (CBS) were assessed by ELISA in AMD patients. The involvement of NMDAR in Hcy’s induced AMD features<sep>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been implicated as a risk factor for severe consequences from COVID-19. We evaluated the genetic architecture shared between AMD and COVID-19 (critical illness, hospitalization, and infections) using analyses of genetic correlations and pleiotropy (i.e., cross-phenotype meta-analysis) of AMD (n = 33,976) and COVID-19 (n ≥ 1,388,342) and subsequent analyses including expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), differential gene expression, and Mendelian randomization (MR). We observed a significant genetic correlation between AMD and COVID-19 infection (rG = 0.10, p<sep>iStent implantation is thought to augment the trabecular outflow channel in the anterior segment of the eye. We hypothesized that iStent with subsequent selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) would better control the intraocular pressure (IOP) compared to standalone SLT in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). We, therefore, determined if the presence of an iStent combined with SLT was statistically associated with IOP lowering compared to standalone SLT.

Pharmacotherapy manages intraocular pressure (IOP) and slows disease progression. However, non-adherence to glaucoma medications remains problematic, with 41-71% of patients being non-adherent to their prescribed medication. Despite substantial investment in research, clinical effort, and patient education protocols, non-adherence remains high. Therefore, we aimed to determine if there is a substantive genetic component behind patients' glaucoma medication non-adherence.

Overexpressed DC scaffolds undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), but DC mesoscale organization at endogenous expression levels and its role in β-catenin processing were previously unknown. Here, we find that DC LLPS is nucleated by the centrosome. Through a combination of CRISPR-engineered custom fluorescent tags, finite element simulations, and optogenetic tools that allow for manipulation of DC concentration and multivalency, we find that centrosomal nucleation drives processing of β-catenin by colocalizing DC components to a single reaction crucible. Enriching GSK3β partitioning on the centrosome controls β-catenin processing and prevents Wnt-driven embryonic stem cell differentiation to mesoderm. Our findings demonstrate the role of nucleators in controlling biomolecular condensates and suggest tight integration between Wnt signal transduction and the cell cycle.<sep>Modulating signaling pathways including Wnt and Hippo can induce cardiomyocyte proliferation in vivo. Applying these signaling modulators to human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in vitro can expand CMs modestly (<5-fold). Here, we demonstrate massive expansion of hiPSC-CMs in vitro (i.e., 100- to 250-fold) by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibition using CHIR99021 and concurrent removal of cell-cell contact. We show that GSK-3β inhibition suppresses CM maturation, while contact removal prevents CMs from cell cycle exit. Remarkably, contact removal enabled 10 to 25 times greater expansion beyond GSK-3β inhibition alone. Mechanistically, persistent CM proliferation required both LEF/TCF activity and AKT phosphorylation but was independent from yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling. Engineered heart tissues from expanded hiPSC-CMs showed comparable contractility to those from unexpanded hiPSC-CMs, demonstrating uncompromised cellular functionality after expansion. In summary, we uncovered a molecular interplay that enables massive hiPSC-CM expansion for large-scale drug screening and tissue engineering applications.<sep>Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are a potentially unlimited cell source and promising patient-specific in vitro model of cardiac diseases. Yet, these cells are limited by immaturity and population heterogeneity. Current in vitro studies aiming at better understanding of the mechanical and chemical cues in the microenvironment that drive cellular maturation involve deformable materials and precise manipulation of the microenvironment with, for example, micropatterns. Such microenvironment manipulation most often involves microfabrication protocols which are time-consuming, require cleanroom facilities and photolithography expertise. Here, we present a method to increase the scale of the fabrication pipeline, thereby enabling large-batch generation of shelf-stable microenvironment protein templates on glass chips. This decreases fabrication time and allows for more flexibility in the subsequent steps, for example, in tuning the material properties and the selection of extracellular matrix or cell proteins. Further, the fabrication of deformable hydrogels has been optimized for compatibility with these templates, in addition to the templates being able to be used to acquire protein patterns directly on the glass chips. With our approach, we have successfully controlled the shapes of cardiomyocytes seeded on Matrigel-patterned hydrogels.<sep>Generating cardiomyocytes (CMs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has represented a significant advance in our ability to model cardiac disease. Current differentiation protocols, however, have limited use due to their production of heterogenous cell populations, primarily consisting of ventricular-like CMs. Here we describe the creation of two chamber-specific reporter hiPSC lines by site-directed genomic integration using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. In the MYL2-tdTomato reporter, the red fluorescent tdTomato was inserted upstream of the 3' untranslated region of the Myosin Light Chain 2 (MYL2) gene in order faithfully label hiPSC-derived ventricular-like CMs while avoiding disruption of endogenous gene expression. Similarly, in the SLN-CFP reporter, Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) was integrated downstream of the coding region of the atrial-specific gene, Sarcolipin (SLN). Purification of tdTomato+ and CFP+ CMs using flow cytometry coupled with transcriptional and functional characterization validated these genetic tools for their use in the isolation of bona fide ventricular-like and atrial-like CMs, respectively. Finally, we successfully generated a double reporter system allowing for the isolation of both ventricular and atrial CM subtypes within a single hiPSC line. These tools provide a platform for chamber-specific hiPSC-derived CM purification and analysis in the context of atrial- or ventricular-specific disease and therapeutic opportunities.<sep>Recent advancements in tissue engineering and material science have radically improved in vitro culturing platforms to more accurately replicate human tissue. However, the transition to clinical relevance has been slow in part due to the lack of biologically compatible/relevant materials. In the present study, we marry the commonly used two-dimensional (2D) technique of electrospinning and a self-assembly process to construct easily reproducible, highly porous, three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber scaffolds for various tissue engineering applications. Specimens from biologically relevant polymers polycaprolactone (PCL) and gelatin were chemically cross-linked using the naturally occurring cross-linker genipin. Potential cytotoxic effects of the scaffolds were analyzed by culturing human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) up to 23 days. The 3D PCL/gelatin/genipin scaffolds produced here resemble the complex nanofibrous architecture found in naturally occurring extracellular matrix (ECM) and exhibit physiologically relevant mechanical properties as well as excellent cell cytocompatibility. Samples cross-linked with 0.5% genipin demonstrated the highest metabolic activity and proliferation rates for HDF. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated excellent cell adhesion and the characteristic morphological features of fibroblasts in all tested samples. The three-dimensional (3D) PCL/gelatin/genipin scaffolds produced here show great potential for various 3D tissue-engineering applications such as ex vivo cell culturing platforms, wound healing, or tissue replacement.<sep>Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have advanced our ability to study the basic function of the heart and model cardiac diseases. Due to the complexities in stem cell culture and differentiation protocols, many researchers source their hiPSC-CMs from collaborators or commercial biobanks. Generally, the field has assumed the health of frozen cardiomyocytes is unchanged if the cells adhere to the substrate and commence beating. However, very few have investigated the effects of cryopreservation on hiPSC-CM's functional and transcriptional health at the cellular and molecular level. Here we review methods and challenges associated with cryopreservation, and examine the effects of cryopreservation on the functionality (contractility and calcium handling) and transcriptome of hiPSC-CMs from six healthy stem cell lines. Utilizing protein patterning methods to template physiological cell aspect ratios (7:1, length:width) in conjunction with polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogels, we measured changes in force generation and calcium handling of single hiPSC-CMs. We observed that cryopreservation altered the functionality and transcriptome of hiPSC-CMs towards larger sizes and contractile force as assessed by increased spread area and volume, single cell traction force microscopy and delayed calcium dynamics. hiPSC-CMs are broadly used for basic science research, regenerative medicine, and testing biological therapeutics. This study informs the design of experiments utilizing hiPSC-CMs to avoid confounding functional changes due to cryopreservation with other treatments.<sep>During development and disease, the heart undergoes biochemical changes. For example, after a heart attack, damaged myocardium regions change extracellular matrix (ECM) protein type composition. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) hold great potential as a model to expand our knowledge of human heart muscle cells and their interactions with the surrounding microenvironment.Polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogels are a common mechanobiology substrate with a tunable physiological relevant stiffness range and allow for functional quantitative measurements such as traction force microscopy. By engineering microphysiological systems with tunable biochemical properties, our aim is to understand the hiPSC-CM mechanobiology of cell-ECM interactions. Our goal is to identify cell-substrate interfaces supporting maximal adhesion and force transfer from hiPSC-CMs. We use protein patterning techniques to obtain discrete ECM protein patterns on the surface of PA hydrogels. We focus on specific ECM protein types (e.g. Laminin-111, Collagen IV, Fibronectin and Collagen I) that are abundant in the myocardium during cardiac development or disease. We then analyze hiPSC-CM structure and function in response to these different ECM protein types. To further probe the role of hiPSC-CMs interactions with ECM on structure and function, we also profile the cell adhesion receptors available for in vitro cell-substrate interaction. Informed by available RNA-Seq data from stages of hiPSC-CMs differentiation and CM development literature, we focus on specific integrin subunits (e.g. α1, α3, α5, α6, α7, β1). We use integrin antibodies to obtain protein data using flow cytometry and compare this to gene expression data. The results of these studies enable tuning microenvironment properties and quantify cell-ECM interactions matched to cardiac development and in disease states.<sep>32 of every 100 global deaths are caused by cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [World Health Organization, CVD Fact Sheet, 2021]. Most mammalian research has been in male cell lines and subjects for over a hundred years which lead to sex related health inequities which are particularly acute for CVD since women have different symptoms than men, and respond differently to CVD treatment [Pierre, Frontiers in Physiology, 2022]. Only in the last ∼10 years have female subjects been required in experimental research studies [Miller, FASEB, 2016]. Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cell derived Cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are an emerging model for the human heart but their sex differences remain understudied. For example, incomplete X chromosome inactivation (XCI) causes many differentially expressed genes between male and female cell lines even in the absence of sex hormones. We characterized the variability and sexual dimorphism of functional phenotypes in hiPSC-CMs using Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) to quantify contractile force generation. Some of this data was adapted from previously published work where we used standard differentiation and culture protocols for 3 female and 4 male cell lines and analyzed >40 cells for each line [Chirikian, JMCC, 2022]. We cultured hiPSC-CM on physiologically-relevant 10-kPa hydrogel substrates patterned with 1500 µm2 rectangular “islands” of Matrigel to constrain cell shapes to a 7:1 aspect ratio. Through regression analysis we observed statistically significant differences in contractile dynamics: male cell force was +19.5% (11%-28.5%), p = 0.0139, and spread area: Af = 823 +/- 17.32 (µm2) vs. Am = 756 +/- 21.64 (µm2), p = 0.0018. In ongoing studies, we are increasing the number of cells lines for each sex and evaluating the effect of estrogen and testosterone added to maintenance media.<sep>Rationale: The cardiac conduction system (CCS) consists of distinct components including the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, His bundle, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. Despite an essential role for the CCS in heart development and function, the CCS has remained challenging to interrogate because of inherent obstacles including small cell numbers, large cell-type heterogeneity, complex anatomy, and difficulty in isolation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing allows for genome-wide analysis of gene expression at single-cell resolution. Objective: Assess the transcriptional landscape of the entire CCS at single-cell resolution by single-cell RNA-sequencing within the developing mouse heart. Methods and Results: Wild-type, embryonic day 16.5 mouse hearts (n=6 per zone) were harvested and 3 zones of microdissection were isolated, including: Zone I—sinoatrial node region; Zone II—atrioventricular node/His region; and Zone III—bundle branch/Purkinje fiber region. Tissue was digested into single-cell suspensions, cells isolated, mRNA reverse transcribed, and barcoded before high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. Single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on over 22 000 cells, and all major cell types of the murine heart were successfully captured including bona fide clusters of cells consistent with each major component of the CCS. Unsupervised weighted gene coexpression network analysis led to the discovery of a host of novel CCS genes, a subset of which were validated using fluorescent in situ hybridization as well as whole-mount immunolabeling with volume imaging (iDISCO+) in 3 dimensions on intact mouse hearts. Further, subcluster analysis unveiled isolation of distinct CCS cell subtypes, including the clinically relevant but poorly characterized transitional cells that bridge the CCS and surrounding myocardium. Conclusions: Our study represents the first comprehensive assessment of the transcriptional profiles from the entire CCS at single-cell resolution and provides a characterization in the context of development and disease.<sep>Hypertrophy Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most prevalent hereditary cardiovascular disease - affecting >1:500 individuals. Advanced forms of HCM clinically present with hypercontractility, hypertrophy and fibrosis. Several single-point mutations in β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) have been associated with HCM and increased contractility at the organ level. Different MYH7 mutations have resulted in increased, decreased, or unchanged force production at the molecular level. Yet how these molecular kinetics link to cell and tissue pathogenesis remains unclear. The Hippo Pathway has been demonstrated to be reactivated in pathological hypertrophic growth, intriguing because it signals proliferative growth during developmental growth and is quiescent during cardiac homeostasis. We hypothesized that changes in force production (intrinsically or extrinsically) directly alter the homeostatic mechano-signaling of the Hippo pathway through changes in stresses on the nucleus. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), we asked whether homeostatic mechanical signaling through the canonical growth regulator, Hippo-YAP, is altered 1) by changes in the biomechanics of single HCM mutant cardiomyocytes and 2) by alterations in the mechanical environment. We use genetically edited hiPSC-CM with point mutations in MYH7 associated with HCM, and their matched controls, combined with micropatterned traction force microscopy substrates of different stiffness to measure changes in contractility and cell size. Mutant hiPSC-CMs display hypercontractile phenotypes and activated Hippo-YAP (% of hiPSC-CMs with nuclear localized YAP, mutants: 56.4% +/-6.85%, control: 32.1% +/-4.67%). The modulation of contractility in healthy hiPSC-CMs by treatment with inotropic drugs or culture in fibrotic-like stiff conditions also activated YAP compared to untreated controls. We hypothesize the activation of YAP in both HCM mutants and healthy hiPSC-CMs treated with contractility modulators is through enhanced nuclear deformation (nuclear aspect ratio amplitude, mutants: 0.063 +/-0.016, control: 0.027 +/-0.005).<sep>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by thickening of the left ventricular wall and hypercontractility and has been linked to mutations in the sarcomere motor protein β-myosin (MYH7). Using single cell mechanobiology studies, we examined how the effects of single point mutations propagate to change the contractile dynamics and cellular morphology (sarcomere spacing, spread area, myofibril alignment) of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). We micropattern islands of adhesive protein to constraining the spreading and alignment of hiPSC-CM on hydrogel substrates containing fluorescent microbeads as fiducial markers for traction force microscopy (TFM). We deployed substrate stiffnesses ranging from physiological (10 kPa) to heavily diseased/fibrotic (100 kPa) to test the role of increased “afterload” in functional phenotypes. We use image and video analysis to assess the contractile dynamics of the hiPSC-CM in terms of force, power, and velocities of relaxation and contraction. For example, we assessed multiple MYH7 mutations edited into the WTC line along with isogenic controls. Some lines carried an endogenously labeled alpha-actinin GFP reporter of sarcomere structure to enable visualization of sarcomere structure and dynamics. We assessed the magnitude and dynamics of contractile force output from TFM video analysis and observed increased the contractile force when compared to the control hiPSC-CMs. We also measured significantly different dynamics in the relaxation or contraction velocities compared to control hiPSC-CMs. Interestingly, not all HCM mutant lines presented a significant increase in cell spread area, a proxy for hypertrophy, and this correlated with culture conditions, such as the size of the protein pattern constraining the cells or stiffness of the substrate. Taken together, these results suggest a role for MYH7 mutations driving remodeling of structure and function at a cell-intrinsic level via changes in mechanosignaling.<sep>Yes Associated Protein (YAP) is a mechanosensitive transcriptional activator regulating a variety of cell fates, including proliferation and cell growth. YAP is activated (localized to the nucleus) in both physiological development (e.g., organ growth mediated by cell proliferation) and pathological heart diseases (e.g., organ growth mediated by cell enlargement). Cardiomyocytes (CMs) generate the mechanical work that powers each heartbeat, and each contraction shortens the CM and strains the nuclei. Mechanical forces and nuclear deformation are considered putative drivers of YAP activation. However, the mechanoregulation of YAP's dual roles in organ growth - through proliferation during development and via hypertrophic enlargement in adulthood - remain unknown. Both contractile output and strain increase as the heart works harder under increased load (e.g., with exercise, disease, aging) and over time can lead to remodeling characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To mimic this additional loading, we first patterned extracellular matrix (Matrigel) single-cell rectangles of 7:1 aspect ratio on silicon substrate of a previously published, microfabricated, silicone pneumatic cell-stretching device (Hart, CAMB, 2021). Then, we then seeded human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CM) on these patterns to elicit an elongated, anisotropic subcellular structure. We applied 15% stretch strain in static and cyclic, at 1 Hz frequency, for 10 mins to hiPSC-CM aligned in perpendicular or in parallel to the direction of stretch. Finally, we fixed and immunostained with YAP antibodies to quantify YAP localization. We quantified the ratio of nuclear/non-nuclear YAP in hiPSC-CM and found an upregulation of nuclear YAP in parallel, 97±10% in static and 42±5% in cyclic, and no significant change in regulation in perpendicular. Ultimately, these experiments will help us understand how mechanical cues and directionality of forces drive nuclear YAP, and the role of YAP signaling in driving hypertrophic hiPSC-CM remodeling.<sep>ABSTRACT Rationale Over 200 mutations in the sarcomeric protein β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, different mutations in MYH7 lead to variable penetrance and clinical severity, and alter myosin function to varying degrees, making it difficult to determine genotype-phenotype relationships, especially when caused by rare gene variants such as the G256E mutation. Objective This study aims to determine the effects of low penetrant MYH7 G256E mutation on myosin function. We hypothesize that the G256E mutation would alter myosin function, precipitating compensatory responses in cellular functions. Methods We developed a collaborative pipeline to characterize myosin function at multiple scales (protein to myofibril to cell to tissue). We also used our previously published data on other mutations to compare the degree to which myosin function was altered. Results At the protein level, the G256E mutation disrupts the transducer region of the S1 head and reduces the fraction of myosin in the folded-back state by 50.9%, suggesting more myosins available for contraction. Myofibrils isolated from hiPSC-CMs CRISPR-edited with G256E (MYH7 WT/G256E ) generated greater tension, had faster tension development and slower early phase relaxation, suggesting altered myosin-actin crossbridge cycling kinetics. This hypercontractile phenotype persisted in single-cell hiPSC-CMs and engineered heart tissues. Single-cell transcriptomic and metabolic profiling demonstrated upregulation of mitochondrial genes and increased mitochondrial respiration, suggesting altered bioenergetics as an early feature of HCM. Conclusions MYH7 G256E mutation causes structural instability in the transducer region, leading to hypercontractility across scales, perhaps from increased myosin recruitment and altered crossbridge cycling. Hypercontractile function of the mutant myosin was accompanied by increased mitochondrial respiration, while cellular hypertrophy was modest in the physiological stiffness environment. We believe that this multi-scale platform will be useful to elucidate genotype-phenotype relationships underlying other genetic cardiovascular diseases.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Genus<sep>Glycopeptide<sep>Omnichannel<sep>Calculus (dental)<sep>Resolution (logic)<sep>Epitope<sep>Osteoporosis<sep>Plant disease<sep>Order (exchange)<sep>Mucoadhesion<sep>Endocrine system<sep>Amputation<sep>Green manure<sep>Immunogenicity<sep>Botrytis cinerea<sep>Scalability<sep>Drug<sep>Antifungal<sep>Ecological succession<sep>Quality-adjusted life year<sep>Vulvovaginal Candidiasis<sep>Information and Communications Technology<sep>Wearable computer<sep>Bevacizumab<sep>Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry<sep>Hormone<sep>E-governance<sep>Narrative<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Cmax<sep>MEN1<sep>Construct validity<sep>Prodrug<sep>Adduct<sep>PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway<sep>Plant litter<sep>Dash<sep>Tandem mass spectrometry<sep>Alkalosis<sep>General hospital<sep>Vicia faba<sep>Bioanalysis<sep>Sialic acid<sep>Narrative review<sep>Goodput<sep>Supply chain<sep>Lygus<sep>Cross-sectional study<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Conjugate<sep>Hepatocyte growth factor<sep>Hierarchy<sep>Characterization (materials science)<sep>Vehicular ad hoc network<sep>Mechanical ventilation<sep>Cannabidiol<sep>Gene<sep>Wearable technology<sep>Epilepsy<sep>Progenitor cell<sep>Osteopenia<sep>Depression (economics)<sep>In vitro<sep>Lung cancer<sep>KRAS<sep>Digital health<sep>vitamin D deficiency<sep>Perception<sep>VATS lobectomy<sep>Extracellular matrix<sep>Wound healing<sep>Lactarius<sep>Metabolic alkalosis<sep>Quality (philosophy)<sep>Discriminant validity<sep>Antibody<sep>Pandemic<sep>Hyponatremia<sep>Family planning<sep>Botrytis<sep>Intensive care<sep>Linker<sep>Intraspecific competition<sep>Streptavidin<sep>Health care<sep>Nausea<sep>Prospective cohort study<sep>Uterine perforation<sep>Randomized controlled trial<sep>Synonym (taxonomy)<sep>Vitamin D and neurology<sep>Drug delivery<sep>Cannabis<sep>Obstetrics and gynaecology<sep>Cronbach's alpha<sep>Biotinylation<sep>Audit<sep>Dronabinol<sep>Mutation<sep>Pharmacodynamics<sep>Scopus<sep>In vivo<sep>Productivity<sep>Endogeny<sep>Thematic analysis<sep>Gas chromatography<sep>mTORC1<sep>PEGylation<sep>Resistance (ecology)<sep>Mental health<sep>Electrolyte Disorder<sep>Wireless ad hoc network<sep>Childbirth<sep>mTORC2<sep>Lymphoma<sep>Monoclonal antibody<sep>Leucaena leucocephala<sep>Downtime<sep>Corporate governance<sep>Rituximab<sep>Pregnancy<sep>Orbitrap<sep>Tenax<sep>Desert (philosophy)<sep>Dental implant<sep>Conjugated system<sep>Leucaena<sep>Anxiety<sep>Cannabinoid<sep>Myeloid leukemia<sep>Magnesium<sep>Backup<sep>Coping (psychology)<sep>Vaginal delivery<sep>Mobile ad hoc network<sep>Brentuximab vedotin<sep>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery<sep>Tetrahydrocannabinol<sep>Implant<sep>Medication adherence<sep>Cholecystectomy<sep>Intensive care unit<sep>Vitamin C<sep>Loneliness<sep>Abortion<sep>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis<sep>Biotransformation<sep>Industry 4.0<sep>Reproductive health<sep>Peptide<sep>Technology integration<sep>High resolution<sep>Vitamin<sep>PEG ratio<sep>Pharmacokinetics<sep>Psychosocial<sep>Analyte<sep>Antibody-drug conjugate<sep>Acidosis<sep>Analytics<sep>Chemotherapy<sep>Near miss</keyword><title>Investigative algorithms for disorders affecting acidosis: a narrative review<sep>Investigative algorithms for disorders affecting plasma potassium: a narrative review<sep>Investigative algorithms for disorders affecting alkalosis: a narrative review<sep>Investigative algorithms for disorders affecting plasma magnesium: a narrative review<sep>High-Resolution Characterization of ADCs by Orbitrap LCMS<sep>Immunoaffinity LC–MS/MS is more suitable than ELISA to quantify a PEGylated molecule in cynomolgus monkey serum<sep>Immunogenicity of antibody–drug conjugates: observations across 8 molecules in 11 clinical trials<sep>Omnichannel Approach to Meet Retail Customers' Expectations<sep>Perception of youth on Digital India<sep>Comparative studies on Culex bitaeniorhynchus Giles (1901) and its tenax variant (Diptera: Culicidae) in Chandigarh, India<sep>Industry 4.0 for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing;

Here we describe a high-resolution Orbitrap MS approach for the characterization of ADC biotransformation and stability.

Traditional methods for testing nephrotoxicity involve animal models or 2D in vitro cell cultures, the latter of which lack the complexity and functionality of the human kidney. 3D in vitro models are created by culturing human primary kidney cells derived from urine in a 3D microenvironment that mimics the fluid shear stresses of the kidney. Thus, 3D in vitro models provide more accurate and reliable predictions of human nephrotoxicity compared to existing 2D models. In this review, we focus on precision nephrotoxicity testing using 3D in vitro models with human autologous urine-derived kidney cells as a promising approach for evaluating drug safety.<sep>The efficacy of quinazoline-based antiglioma agents has been attributed to their effects on microtubule dynamics.1,2 The design, synthesis and biological evaluation of quinazolines as potent inhibitors of multiple intracellular targets, including microtubules and multiple RTKs, is described. In addition to the known ability of quinazolines 1 and 2 to cause microtubule depolymerization, they were found to be low nanomolar inhibitors of EGFR, VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-β. Low nanomolar inhibition of EGFR was observed for 1–3 and 9–10. Compounds 1 and 4 inhibited VEGFR-2 kinase with activity better than or equal to that of sunitinib. In addition, compounds 1 and 2 had similar potency to sunitinib in the CAM angiogenesis assay. Multitarget activities of compounds in the present study demonstrates that the quinazolines can affect multiple pathways and could lead to these agents having antitumor potential caused by their activity against multiple targets.<sep>A series of methoxy naphthyl substituted cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine compounds, 4-10, were designed and synthesized to study the influence of the 3-D conformation on microtubule depolymerizing and antiproliferative activities. NOESY studies with the N,2-dimethyl-N-(6'-methoxynaphthyl-1'-amino)-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidin-4-amine (4) showed hindered rotation of the naphthyl ring around the cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine scaffold. In contrast, NOESY studies with N,2-dimethyl-N-(5'-methoxynaphthyl-2'-amino)-cyclopenta[d]pyrimidin-4-amine (5) showed free rotation of the naphthyl ring around the cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine scaffold. The rotational flexibility and conformational dissimilarity between 4 and 5 led to a significant difference in biological activities. Compound 4 is inactive while 5 is the most potent in this series with potent microtubule depolymerizing effects and low nanomolar IC50 values in vitro against a variety of cancer cell lines. The ability of 5 to inhibit tumor growth in vivo was investigated in a U251 glioma xenograft model. The results show that 5 had better antitumor effects than the positive control temozolomide and have identified 5 as a potential preclinical candidate for further studies. The influence of conformation on the microtubule depolymerizing and antitumor activity forms the basis for the development of conformation-activity relationships for the cyclopenta[d]pyrimidine class of microtubule targeting agents.<sep>Mitochondrial toxicity (Mito-Tox) risk has increased due to the administration of several classes of drugs, particularly some life-long antiretroviral drugs for HIV+ individuals. However, no suitable in vitro assays are available to test long-term Mito-Tox (≥4 weeks). The goal of this study is to develop a 3D spheroid system of human primary urine-derived stem cells (USC) for the prediction of drug-induced delayed Mito-Tox. The cytotoxicity and Mito-Tox were assessed in 3D USC spheroids 4 weeks after treatment with antiretroviral drugs: zalcitabine (ddC; 0.1, 1 and 10 µM), tenofovir (TFV; 3, 30 and 300 µM) or Raltegravir (RAL; 2, 20 and 200 µM). Rotenone (RTNN, 10 µM) and 0.1% DMSO served as positive and negative controls. Despite only mild cytotoxicity, ddC significantly inhibited the expression of oxidative phosphorylation enzyme Complexes I, III, and IV; and RAL transiently reduced the level of Complex IV. A significant increase in caspase 3 and ROS/RNS level but a decrease in total ATP were observed in USC treated with ddC, TFV, RAL, and RTNN. Levels of mtDNA content and mitochondrial mass were decreased in ddC but minimally or not in TFV- and RAL-treated spheroids. Thus, 3D USC spheroid using antiretroviral drugs as a model offers an alternative platform to assess drug-induced late Mito-Tox.<sep>The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series novel N1‑methyl pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidines as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization and colchicine binding were described here. Synthesis of target compounds involved alkylation of the pyrazolo scaffold, which afforded two regioisomers. These were separated, characterized and identified with 1H NMR and NOESY spectroscopy. All compounds, except 10, inhibited [3H]colchicine binding to tubulin, and the potent inhibition was similar to that obtained with CA-4. Compounds 9 and 11-13 strongly inhibited the polymerization of tubulin, with IC50 values of 0.45, 0.42, 0.49 and 0.42 μM, respectively. Compounds 14-16 inhibited the polymerization of tubulin with IC50s near ∼1 μM. Compounds 9, 12, 13 and 16 inhibited MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines and circumvented βIII-tubulin mediated cancer cell resistance to taxanes and other MTAs, and compounds 9-17 circumvented Pgp-mediated drug resistance. In the standard NCI testing protocol, compound 9 exhibited excellent potency with low to sub nanomolar GI50 values (≤10 nM) against most tumor cell lines, including several multidrug resistant phenotypes. Compound 9 was significantly (P < 0.0001) better than paclitaxel at reducing MCF-7 TUBB3 (βIII-tubulin overexpressing) tumors in a mouse xenograft model. Collectively, these studies support the further preclinical development of the pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold as a new generation of tubulin inhibitors and 9 as an anticancer agent with advantages over paclitaxel.<sep>It is imperative to explore the gigantic available chemical space to identify new scaffolds for drug lead discovery. Identifying potent hits from virtual screening of large chemical databases is challenging and computationally demanding. Rather than the traditional two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) approaches on smaller chemical libraries of a few hundred thousand compounds, we screened a ZINC library of 15 million compounds using multiple computational methods. Here, we present the successful application of a virtual screening methodology that identifies several chemotypes as starting hits against lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA). From 29 compounds identified from virtual screening, 17 (58%) showed IC50 values < 63 μM, two showed single-digit micromolar inhibition, and the most potent hit compound had IC50 down to 117 nM. We enriched the database and employed an ensemble approach by combining 2D fingerprint similarity searches, pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics. WaterMap calculations were carried out to explore the thermodynamics of surface water molecules and gain insights into the LDHA binding pocket. The present work has led to the discovery of two new chemical classes, including compounds with a succinic acid monoamide moiety or a hydroxy pyrimidinone ring system. Selected hits block lactate production in cells and inhibit pancreatic cancer cell lines with cytotoxicity IC50 down to 12.26 μM against MIAPaCa-2 cells and 14.64 μM against PANC-1, which, under normoxic conditions, is already comparable or more potent than most currently available known LDHA inhibitors.<sep>Cancer recurrence remains a great fear for many cancer survivors following their initial, apparently successful, therapy. Despite significant improvement in the overall survival of many types of cancer, metastasis accounts for ~90% of all cancer mortality. There is a growing understanding that future therapeutic practices must accommodate this unmet medical need in preventing metastatic recurrence. Accumulating evidence supports dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) as a source of cancer recurrence and recognizes the need for novel strategies to target these tumor cells. This review presents strategies to target dormant quiescent DTCs that reside at secondary sites. These strategies aim to prevent recurrence by maintaining dormant DTCs at bay, or eradicating them. Various approaches are presented, including: reinforcing the niche where dormant DTCs reside in order to keep dormant DTCs at bay; promoting cell intrinsic mechanisms to induce dormancy; preventing the engagement of dormant DTCs with their supportive niche in order to prevent their reactivation; targeting cell-intrinsic mechanisms mediating long-term survival of dormant DTCs; sensitizing dormant DTCs to chemotherapy treatments; and, inhibiting the immune evasion of dormant DTCs, leading to their demise. Various therapeutic approaches, some of which utilize drugs that are already approved, or have been tested in clinical trials and may be considered for repurposing, will be discussed. In addition, clinical evidence for the presence of dormant DTCs will be reviewed, along with potential prognostic biomarkers to enable the identification and stratification of patients who are at high risk of recurrence, and who could benefit from novel dormant DTCs targeting therapies. Finally, we will address the shortcomings of current trial designs for determining activity against dormant DTCs and provide novel approaches.<sep>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health disorder that occurs after exposure to a traumatic event. Patients with comorbid chronic pain experience affective distress, worse quality of life, and poorer responses to treatments for pain or PTSD than those with either condition alone. FDA-approved PTSD treatments are often ineffective analgesics, requiring additional drugs to treat co-morbid symptoms. Therefore, development of new treatment strategies necessitate a better understanding of the pathophysiology of PTSD and comorbid pain. The single prolonged stress (SPS) model of PTSD induces the development of persistent mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Increased Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) levels in serum and CSF accompany these exaggerated nociceptive responses, as well as increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Therefore, the primary goal was to determine the role of TNF-α in the development of SPS-induced allodynia/hyperalgesia and elevated serum and CNS N/OFQ using two approaches: TNF-α synthesis inhibition, and blockade with anti-TNF-α antibody that acts primarily in the periphery. Administration of TNF-α synthesis blocker, thalidomide (THL), immediately after SPS prevented increased TNF-α and development of allodynia and hyperalgesia. The THL effect lasted at least 21 days, well after thalidomide treatment ended (day 5). THL also prevented SPS-induced increases in serum N/OFQ and reversed regional N/OFQ mRNA expression changes in the CNS. Serum TNF-α increases detected at 4 and 24 h post SPS were not accompanied by blood brain barrier disruption. A single injection of anti-TNF-α antibody to male and female rats during the SPS procedure prevented the development of allodynia, hyperalgesia, and elevated serum N/OFQ, and reduced SPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors in males. Anti-TNFα treatment also blocked development of SPS-induced allodynia in females, and blocked increased hypothalamic N/OFQ in males and females. This suggests that a peripheral TNF-α surge is necessary for the initiation of allodynia associated with SPS, as well as the altered central and peripheral N/OFQ that maintains nociceptive sensitivity. Therefore, early alleviation of TNF-α provides new therapeutic options for investigation as future PTSD and co-morbid pain treatments.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Viral encephalitis<sep>Hematology<sep>Immunogenicity<sep>Rhesus macaque<sep>Immunophenotyping<sep>Simian immunodeficiency virus<sep>Outbreak<sep>Dynamics (music)<sep>T cell<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>CXCR3<sep>Clinical trial<sep>Ebola vaccine<sep>Encephalitis<sep>Immune system<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Neuropathology<sep>Adverse effect<sep>Clinical pathology<sep>Coinfection<sep>DNA vaccination<sep>Viral load<sep>Tuberculosis<sep>2019-20 coronavirus outbreak</keyword><title>Lack of susceptibility in neonatally infected rhesus macaques to simian immunodeficiency virus-induced encephalitis<sep>The dynamics of γδ T cell responses in nonhuman primates during SARS-CoV-2 infection<sep>Impact of SIV infection on mycobacterial lipid-reactive T cell responses in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) inoculated macaques<sep>Systematic review of Marburg virus vaccine nonhuman primate studies and human clinical trials<sep>Clinical and Immunological Metrics During Pediatric Rhesus Macaque Development</title><abstract>Despite combination antiretroviral therapies making HIV a chronic rather than terminal condition for many people, the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is increasing. This is especially problematic for children living with HIV. Children diagnosed HAND rarely display the hallmark pathology of HIV encephalitis in adults, namely infected macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in the brain. This finding has also been documented in rhesus macaques infected perinatally with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). However, the extent and mechanisms of lack of susceptibility to encephalitis in perinatally HIV-infected children remain unclear. In the current study, we compared brains of macaques infected with pathogenic strains of SIV at different ages to determine neuropathology, correlates of neuroinflammation, and potential underlying mechanisms. Encephalitis was not found in the macaques infected within 24 h of birth despite similar high plasma viral load and high monocyte turnover. Macaques developed encephalitis only when they were infected after 4 months of age. Lower numbers of CCR5-positive cells in the brain, combined with a less leaky blood-brain barrier, may be responsible for the decreased virus infection in the brain and consequently the absence of encephalitis in newborn macaques infected with SIV.<sep>Abstract Although most SARS-CoV-2 infections are mild, some patients develop systemic inflammation and progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this spectrum of disease remain unclear. γδT cells are T lymphocyte subsets that have key roles in systemic and mucosal immune responses during infection and inflammation. Here we show that peripheral γδT cells are rapidly activated following aerosol or intra-tracheal/intra-nasal (IT/IN) SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primates. Our results demonstrate a rapid expansion of Vδ1 γδT cells at day1 that correlate significantly with lung viral loads during the first week of infection. Furthermore, increase in levels of CCR6 and Granzyme B expression in Vδ1 T cells during viral clearance imply a role in innate-like epithelial barrier-protective and cytotoxic functions. Importantly, the early activation and mobilization of circulating HLA-DR + CXCR3 + γδT cells along with significant correlations of Vδ1 T cells with IL-1Ra and SCF levels in bronchoalveolar lavage suggest a novel role for Vδ1 T cells in regulating lung inflammation during aerosol SARS-CoV-2 infection. A deeper understanding of the immunoregulatory functions of MHC-unrestricted Vδ1 T cells in lungs during early SARS-CoV-2 infection is particularly important in the wake of emerging new variants with increased transmissibility and immune evasion potential.<sep>Background Although BCG vaccine protects infants from tuberculosis (TB), it has limited efficacy in adults against pulmonary TB. Further, HIV coinfection significantly increases the risk of developing active TB. In the lack of defined correlates of protection in TB disease, it is essential to explore immune responses beyond conventional CD4 T cells to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of TB immunity. Methods Here, we evaluated unconventional lipid-reactive T cell responses in cynomolgus macaques following aerosol BCG inoculation and examined the impact of subsequent SIV infection on these responses. Immune responses to cellular lipids of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis were examined ex vivo in peripheral blood and bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL). Results Prior to BCG inoculation, innate-like IFN-γ responses to mycobacterial lipids were observed in T cells. Aerosol BCG exposure induced an early increase in frequencies of BAL γδT cells, a dominant subset of lipid-reactive T cells, along with enhanced IL-7R and CXCR3 expression. Further, BCG exposure stimulated greater IFN-γ responses to mycobacterial lipids in peripheral blood and BAL, suggesting the induction of systemic and local Th1-type response in lipid-reactive T cells. Subsequent SIV infection resulted in a significant loss of IL-7R expression on blood and BAL γδT cells. Additionally, IFN-γ responses of mycobacterial lipid-reactive T cells in BAL fluid were significantly lower in SIV-infected macaques, while perforin production was maintained through chronic SIV infection. Conclusions Overall, these data suggest that despite SIV-induced decline in IL-7R expression and IFN-γ production by mycobacterial lipid-reactive T cells, their cytolytic potential is maintained. A deeper understanding of anti-mycobacterial lipid-reactive T cell functions may inform novel approaches to enhance TB control in individuals with or without HIV infection.<sep>Recent deadly outbreaks of Marburg virus underscore the need for an effective vaccine. A summary of the latest research is needed for this WHO priority pathogen. This systematic review aimed to determine progress towards a vaccine for Marburg virus. Article search criteria were developed to query PubMed for peer-reviewed articles from 1990 through 2019 on Marburg virus vaccine clinical trials in humans and pre-clinical studies in non-human primates (NHP). Abstracts were reviewed by two authors. Relevant articles were reviewed in full. Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. Data abstracted included year, author, title, vaccine construct, number of subjects, efficacy, and demographics. Assessment for risk of bias was performed using the Syrcle tool for animal studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool for human studies. 101 articles were identified; 27 were related to Marburg vaccines. After full text review, 21 articles were selected. 215 human subjects were in three phase 1 clinical trials, and 203 NHP in 18 studies. Vaccine constructs were DNA plasmids, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors, adenovirus vectors, virus-like particles (VLP), among others. Two human phase 1 studies of DNA vaccines had 4 adverse effects requiring vaccine discontinuation among 128 participants and 31–80% immunogenicity. In NHP challenge studies, 100% survival was seen in 6 VSV vectored vaccines, 2 DNA vaccines, 2 VLP vaccines, and in 1 adenoviral vectored vaccine. In human trials, two Marburg DNA vaccines provided either low immunogenicity or a failure to elicit durable immunity. A variety of NHP candidate Marburg vaccines demonstrated favorable survival and immunogenicity parameters, to include VSV, VLP, and adenoviral vectored vaccines. Elevated binding antibodies appeared to be consistently associated with protection across the NHP challenge studies. Further human trials are needed to advance vaccines to limit the spread of this highly lethal virus.<sep>Background: Clinical measurements commonly used to evaluate overall health of laboratory animals including complete blood count, serum chemistry, weight, and immunophenotyping, differ with respect to age, development, and environment. This report provides comprehensive clinical and immunological reference ranges for pediatric rhesus macaques over the first year of life. Methods: We collected and analyzed blood samples from 151 healthy rhesus macaques, aged 0-55 weeks, and compared mother-reared infants to two categories of nursery-reared infants; those on an active research protocol and those under derivation for the expanded specific-pathogen-free breeding colony. Hematology was performed on EDTA-anticoagulated blood using a Sysmex XT2000i, and serum clinical chemistry was performed using the Beckman AU480 chemistry analyzer. Immunophenotyping of whole blood was performed with immunofluorescence staining and subsequent flow cytometric analysis on a BD LSRFortessa. Plasma cytokine analysis was performed using a Millipore multiplex Luminex assay. Results: For hematological and chemistry measurements, pediatric reference ranges deviate largely from adults. Comparison of mother-reared and nursery-reared animals revealed that large differences depend on rearing conditions and diet. Significant differences found between two nursery-reared cohorts (research and colony animals) indicate large influences of experimental factors and anesthetic events on these parameters. Immune cells and cytokine responses presented with distinct patterns for infants depending on age, birth location, and rearing conditions. Conclusions: Our results illustrate how the immune system changed over time and that there was variability among pediatric age groups. Reference ranges of results reported here will support interpretations for how infection and treatment may skew common immune correlates used for assessment of pathology or protection in research studies as well as help veterinarians in the clinical care of infant non-human primates. We highlighted the importance of using age-specific reference comparisons for pediatric studies and reiterated the utility of rhesus macaques as a model for human studies. Given the rapid transformation that occurs in multiple tissue compartments after birth and cumulative exposures to antigens as individuals grow, a better understanding of immunological development and how this relates to timing of infection or vaccination will support optimal experimental designs for developing vaccines and treatment interventions.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/542878", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5014175543", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5025778635", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A has extensive experience in drug development, toxicology, and cancer research, with a focus on in vitro and in vivo models, but lacks direct experience in immunology or vaccine research.

We ground our study in scholarship on ‘othering’ and the notion of banal nationalism (Billig, 1995) and conduct a thematic analysis of the shows. Our findings show that the programmes adopt a Korea-foreign dichotomy that becomes a lens through which viewers can vicariously experience the existence of a unified South Korean culture. We argue that the juxtaposition of a Korean ‘us’ against a foreign ‘them’ precludes imagining a more pluralistic South Korea – even as the programmes ostensibly celebrate South Korea’s increasing diversity.<sep>This article features a content analysis of the entire corpus of news articles published about North and South Korea by five major American news websites in 2016. It provides an insight into the multiple and contradictory ways in which North Korea is framed by the American news media. The study finds that responsibility for the ongoing crisis on the peninsula is attributed to a small number of actors and that attribution of responsibility, as well as intensity of coverage, differs significantly among news agencies. Cable news was found to focus on conflict to a greater degree than non-cable outlets, and online-only news sites were found to focus more on Kim Jong-un individually. The article qualitatively addresses these differences in coverage and discusses their implications.<sep>Abstract This article applies theories of cosmopolitanism-from-below A. Appadurai (2011), F. Kurasawa (2004) to an empirical case. Drawing on participant-observation and interviews conducted over the course of 20 months at a Korean-English Meetup group in the United States, this article explores the practices of an explicitly “cosmopolitan” group. Specifically, it focuses on U.S. Americans and Korean interns, and considers their experiences and motivations within the broader structures of neoliberalism. The group is identified as alternately exemplifying and challenging neoliberal logic and the article considers the relationship between neoliberalism and different forms of cosmopolitanism. The cosmopolitan ethos fostered by the group’s founder and reinforced through members’ practice offers preliminary but hopeful evidence of a cosmopolitanism that challenges neoliberalism and the uneven distribution of cultural/economic capital.<sep>Abstract This article considers the rapidly expanding online market for English teaching. Drawing on interviews with 11 Filipino online English teachers and the first author's own experiences teaching English online, we examine how teachers feel under the conditions of precarity they experience in the gig economy for language teaching. In addressing the experiences of Filipino teachers, we introduce the notion of “discounted nativeness.” Discounted nativeness describes Filipino teachers’ ambivalent position within the online English teaching industry: platforms take advantage of Filipino teachers' high levels of English proficiency—up to and including passing them off as American teachers—while the teachers experience discrimination from students and maltreatment by the platforms. The article concludes by discussing the need for sustained research into the burgeoning market for online language teaching.<sep>This article examines the role of production techniques in shaping representations of cultural diversity in South Korean reality television. We first discuss the South Korean government’s evolving guidelines concerning the representation of minorities on television and identify in the guidelines exhortations against discriminatory framing of migrants. Next, we qualitatively examine three popular multicultural-themed reality television shows and demonstrate that the shows ultimately circumvent the government guidelines via specific production techniques, including voice-overs and format decisions. We argue that these techniques, in combination with genre constraints and financial constraints, play a crucial role in othering the migrants portrayed on South Korean reality television. We conclude by considering how reality television can, and should, more accurately reflect the country’s changing demographics, more positively represent minority guests, and more actively encourage transformative dialogue about South Korea’s multicultural present and future.<sep>This article considers the burgeoning online market for language learning as representative of an emerging form of Internet-enabled pop cosmopolitanism. The analysis is based upon a survey-experiment conducted on one of the world’s largest online language learning platforms. Drawing on theories of media globalization, cosmopolitanism and language ideologies, the study explores the factors that drive participation in online language learning and the attributes students favor in teacher selection. The results suggest that student preferences are closely related to learning motivations and media consumption. Specifically, ‘pop cosmopolitan’ students are far more likely to favor native speakers than students who are motivated by more mundane instrumental goals (such as career advancement). We attribute these findings to enduring perceptions about native speakers as more authentic representations of a particular language and culture. The implications of these findings for theories of pop cosmopolitanism and online language learning are discussed.<sep>This article introduces LanguaSpeak, a heretofore underexplored digital platform that functions as a market for language learners and teachers. It argues that LanguaSpeak, through both its interface and users’ communicative practice, unwittingly reinforces existing language ideologies, particularly around race. In making this argument, the article suggests the notion of “intersectional English(es)” as a means through which scholars can productively consider the ways in which race, nationality, and language intersect and are (re)enforced through online interfaces/interaction. Drawing on data collected from the profiles of English teachers from the United States and the Philippines, this article examines how language, nationality, and race intersect on LanguaSpeak. Key differences identified between the two countries’ teachers include price and marketing strategies. Specifically, White male American teachers are found to enjoy significant advantages over other teachers, reflecting dominant language ideologies. This has implications for English language teaching and language discrimination more broadly.<sep>This article considers how language learners conceptualize their ideal teacher within the context of gig economy language platforms (GELPs). GELPs differ significantly from traditional language learning in that their users are able to change between teachers easily and also select teachers according to a far wider range of criteria than is available to offline learners. However, much remains unknown about which attributes GELP users seek in their language teachers. This study draws on responses to an open-ended questionnaire (N = 1,488) to consider which characteristics GELP users favor in their ideal teacher. The study includes both learners of English as well as learners of other languages. Ideologies of native speakerism are found to affect both groups but rapport emerges as a more common theme. The article concludes by discussing the potential opportunities and pitfalls that GELPs represent in terms of furthering intercultural learning and combating stereotypes.<sep>With K-pop's tremendous growth transnationally, scholars have pointed to the industry's inclusion of singers from different national and ethnic backgrounds, highlighting them as examples of successful glocalization. But there has been little attention paid to how these “foreign” singers, now integrated into the Korean pop music industry, are received within South Korea itself. In South Korea, public attention towards these idols has intensified as a result of the global success of multinational K-pop groups like Blackpink and NCT. The public visibility of these idols complicates South Korea's image as an ethnically, linguistically, and culturally homogenous nation. This article examines the domestic reception of these idols, exploring the tensions that emerge at the intersection of Koreanness, K-pop, and multiculturalism in South Korea today. Drawing on focus group interviews with Korean K-pop fans as well as Koreans who do not actively follow the industry, the article explicates how foreign K-pop idols alternately challenge and reinforce contemporary understandings of Koreanness.<sep>Since 2010, the Philippines has been one of the largest contributors of workers to the increasingly global industry of remote English language tutoring. In this nascent and growing industry, Filipino online English tutors are employed by online platforms as independent contractors where they instruct students on a piece-meal basis. This article draws on interviews with 11 Filipino online tutors to discuss the various strategies that Filipino online English tutors deploy to successfully navigate their encounters with students whose cultural backgrounds differ from their own. We suggest the notion of intercultural bricolage to make sense of online tutors' self-acquired strategies for retaining students and succeeding as online tutors despite the various difficulties encountered with this type of remote work. While the notion of intercultural bricolage applies to the practices of many offline language teachers as well, we highlight how elements unique to online teaching—including lesson-by-lesson contracts—make intercultural bricolage an indispensable component of tutors’ success on online language teaching platforms.<sep>This article examines the rapidly expanding market for online English learning and tutoring. It focuses on the experiences of Black American online English teachers employed on a variety of popular online teaching platforms (e.g. Cambly, italki, PalFish, VIPKid etc.). Specifically, the article considers how specific affordances of online English teaching platforms (e.g. customer ratings and algorithms) function to disadvantage non-White teachers. In order to address these issues, the article brings together two relevant but distinct literatures: scholarship on language ideologies and scholarship on algorithms and the gig economy. The data analyzed include: Semi-structured interviews with Black online English teachers; the websites of popular teaching platforms; and posts in public Reddit threads focused on online English teaching. The findings demonstrate how Black teachers experience the intersection of customer-based ratings and algorithms within the burgeoning online English teaching industry. The article concludes by advocating for scholars to more systematically engage with and study online tutoring platforms’ use of rating and algorithms.<sep>This article examines Korean Twitter discourse surrounding Yemeni refugees in South Korea. Sequestered on Jeju Island since their arrival in 2018, the 500 refugees have prompted enormous public debate in Korea, which has until recently defined itself in terms of a mono-ethnic identity. Grounded in the literature on Korean digital feminism, this article conducts a thematic analysis from a corpus of more than 8,000 Korean-language tweets. The refugees and their situation are found to be appropriated by different segments of South Korean society to make broader arguments about gender, nationalism, and economic insecurity. This article finds that prorefugee and antirefugee arguments draw on identical themes to draw opposite conclusions predicated on their different understandings of “Koreanness” in increasingly multicultural South Korea. The article suggests the notion of “affective splintering” to make sense of the lack of cohesion among individuals within superficially ideologically aligned groups, such as conservatives or digital feminists. Similarities and differences with Twitter discourse on refugees from other contexts are discussed.<sep>This study examines how people perceive artwork created by artificial intelligence (AI) and how presumed knowledge of an artist's identity (Human vs. AI) affects individuals’ evaluation of art. Drawing on Schema theory and theory of Computers Are Social Actors (CASA), this study used a survey-experiment that controlled for the identity of the artist (AI vs. Human) and presented participants with two types of artworks (AI-created vs. Human-created). After seeing images of six artworks created by either AI or human artists, participants ( n = 288) were asked to evaluate the artistic value using a validated scale commonly employed among art professionals. The study found that human-created artworks and AI-created artworks were not judged to be equivalent in their artistic value. Additionally, knowing that a piece of art was created by AI did not, in general, influence participants’ evaluation of art pieces’ artistic value. However, having a schema that AI cannot make art significantly influenced evaluation. Implications of the findings for application and theory are discussed.<sep>Abstract The gig economy is rapidly transforming service-based industries, including online teaching. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of people worldwide to work remotely, gig economy teaching generated billions of dollars in revenue and was responsible for millions of lessons per month. Although the global labor market is currently experiencing a major shift because of the gig economy, applied linguists have paid little attention to gig-based work and its implications. The current study narrows this research gap by using self-branding theories to understand the ways in which gig economy teachers market themselves to potential students. The findings, which are based on 100 teacher profiles, reveal that teachers adopt four self-branding discourses when marketing their teaching services. These self-branding discourses may vary according to the teacher’s country of origin, professional qualifications, and first language background. The study argues that self-branding discourses reflect a larger, and perhaps more problematic, global trend in which individual workers directly compete against each other in a race to lower earnings and job security.<sep>This article examines the intersection of English and coffee in Seoul, South Korea, in order to document how distinction (ala Bourdieu, 1984/2008) functions under the prevailing conditions of neoliberalism. A mere two decades after Starbucks first opened in Korea, high-end specialty coffee shops proliferate. Drawing on photographs of the exteriors, interiors, and menus from 89 coffee shops in the trendy Seongsu-dong neighborhood in Seoul, we examine how coffee shops deploy English (in addition to or instead of Korean) in their signage, and how this deployment differs by type of coffee shop. We argue that English and coffee interact in a complex process of dual distinction. The coffee shops brand themselves as cosmopolitan and simultaneously offer the customers the distinction of demonstrating themselves knowledgeable about/proficient in both coffee and English. We explain this dual distinction in terms of the extreme competitiveness occasioned by neoliberalism in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. We conclude by suggesting the notion of “transient cosmopolitanism” as a way to understand specialty coffee shops, which we argue are crucial sites for understanding the contemporary subjectivities occasioned by the dominance of neoliberalism.<sep>ABSTRACTThis article considers the potential of language-focused online teaching platforms (OTPs) for fostering intercultural communication among their users. Drawing on interviews alongside an analysis of two OTPs websites, I argue that OTPs' webpages (re)produce banal nationalism grounded in nation-language congruence and instrumentalist language ideologies that conceive of language learning in terms of potential socioeconomic gains. However, I also find that: (1) learners' experiences can result in them questioning essentialist language ideologies; and (2) many users embrace a language ideology of conversational cosmopolitanism, which is premised on open-minded interaction with others and is consistent with the goals of intercultural communication educators.日常民族主义与对话式的世界主义：网络外语教学对跨文化交流的挑战与愿景该论文讨论网络外语教学平台推动其使用者进行跨文化交流的潜在作用。通过分析两个网络外语教学平台的页面设置以及对平台使用者进行访谈，笔者发现，网络外语教学平台正在输出基于“民族语言”的日常民族主义价值观以及工具主义式的语言意识形态。该种工具主义式的语言意识形态宣扬外语学习的意义在于潜在的社会经济收益。然而，笔者亦发现：1）部分学生的学习经验鼓励他们质疑本质主义式的“民族语言”观念；2）不少使用者拥抱一种笔者称之为“对话式的世界主义”的语言意识形态，这种进步的语言意识形态倡导不同文化之间的开放交流，并且与跨文化交流的教育主旨相一致。关键词：跨文化交流，网络外语教学平台，日常民族主义，世界主义，网络外语学习KEYWORDS: Intercultural communicationonline teaching platformsbanal nationalismcosmopolitanismonline language learning Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationNotes on contributorsNathaniel Ming CurranNathaniel Ming Curran is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English and Communication at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

This paper examines two examples of multilingualism in directive signs within Seoul, South Korea in order to theorize what gives rise to multilingualism in directive signage while other signage remains monolingual. Examination of Vietnamese and Arabic on signs prohibiting the illegal disposal of household garbage on side streets in Seoul, and English, Chinese, and Japanese on mask-required due to COVID-19 signs within the Seoul subway system allows for a robust analysis of what shapes the inclusion of additional languages on directive signage. We posit the construction of a differently speaking other who is seen as likely to disobey stated regulations alongside the desire by authorities to minimize the effort required to respond to rule breaking results in a multilingual commanding urgency that shapes multilingualism in directive signage. The concept of multilingual commanding urgency emphasizes the role enforcement practices have in shaping multilingualism, an important development in understanding this form of signage. Multilingual commanding urgency is especially relevant as it shapes signage deployed in emergency contexts such as the COVID-19 pandemic.<sep>ABSTRACTFacilitated by the increased availability of affordable broadband Internet, individuals around the world are taking language lessons online from private tutors. A large proportion of online language tutoring takes place through online teaching platforms (OTPs), which are two-sided online markets that connect individual learners and tutors for piece-meal lessons. This paper considers how salient aspects of teachers’ identities drives teacher selection on OTPs. Using a discrete choice experiment design (N = 971) distributed to online English learners from four countries, (Brazil, Italy, Spain and Korea) the paper tests hypotheses related to linguistic, racial and gender-based discrimination. The results reveal that participants’ preference for L1 teachers far exceeds their preference for pedagogically qualified instructors and that learners prefer female to male teachers. Further, learners’ preference for L1 teachers is stronger when the teacher is White than when the teacher is Black. The results also indicate that foreign media consumption correlates with reduced racial bias. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.KEYWORDS: Online teaching platformsgig economylanguage learningnative speakerism Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Correction StatementThis article has been corrected with minor changes.

Series II: Nachlass. A: Nachgelassene Schriften. Vol. 13: Ästhetische Schriften</title><abstract>Abstract According to what is now the standard account in the history of psychology, in the 1880s William James and the Danish physician Carl Georg Lange independently developed a strikingly new theory, commonly referred to as the ‘James–Lange’ theory of emotion. In this paper it is argued that this standard account is highly misleading. Lange's views on affect in his (1885) Om Sindsbevægelser were more cautious than James allowed, and not open to criticisms that have often been levelled against the theory of emotion that James claimed he shared with Lange. In fact, Lange argued for distinctions that James did not mention in his discussion of Lange's work. Even with regard to the primary emotions, the two thinkers’ explanatory models diverged significantly. The contrast between James and Lange on affect is especially striking in their respective discussions of topics in aesthetics, as is established with reference to Lange's little-known (1899) Bidrag til Nydelsernes fysiologi som grundlag for en rationel æstetik.<sep>This chapter identifies three rival interpretations of Autumn Sonata. A first reading describes a work that, like Face to Face, was conceived along Janovian lines, and that consequently resonates positively with the tenets of Janov’s psychology. The second and third interpretations both deny that Autumn Sonata is consistently Janovian. According to one kind of ‘non-Janovian’ interpretation, Bergman worked with significant Janovian premises as he conceived of the story and characterizations for Autumn Sonata, yet for various reasons, the director did not, finally, go on to make a thoroughly Janovian work. An alternative interpretation contends that Bergman had taken some critical distance from at least some of the main tenets of Janov’s psychological theory and successfully expressed these reservations in his film. In other words, Bergman was not thoroughly or consistently persuaded of the truth of Janov’s theoretical contentions, either at the time of his initial, enthusiastic reading of The Primal Screen or upon subsequent reflection. On the basis of an examination of the relevant evidence, the chapter argues that although Bergman undeniably sought to bring out a story along Janovian lines, he ended up with one that instructively manifests ways in which that doctrine is incomplete and problematic.<sep>At the time of his death in 1848, Bernard Bolzano had completed two essays in aesthetics, one on beauty and one on the fine arts (Bolzano, 1843, 1849, 2015, 2017; for background and commentary see Rusnock and Šebestík, 2019, pp. 544–594; Livingston, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2021). Bolzano continued in his final years to work on topics in aesthetics, leaving behind a variety of drafts and notes. The volume under review is the long-awaited publication of this Nachlass. Editorial work on the volume was begun many years ago by the talented and industrious Bolzano scholar, Jan Berg, yet remained incomplete at the time of his death in 2015. The editor-in-chief of the Bernard-Bolzano-Gesamtausgabe, Edgar Morscher, shouldered the responsibility for bringing the project to completion. He was assisted by Kurt F. Strasser and Berg’s long-time collaborator, Peter Michael Schenkel. The contents of this volume can be briefly indicated as follows: This is critical-editorial scholarship at its best. The manuscripts that Bolzano left behind are in a very difficult and, at times, illegible hand. Bolzano used many abbreviations, only hinting at the words he had in mind. He made many corrections, often filled the margins with additions, and struck out lines or even entire pages of legible prose. The transcription of these texts demanded a painstaking and time-consuming process of educated mind-reading, an art that Berg had duly perfected in his editing of many volumes in the Gesamtausgabe.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Simple (philosophy)<sep>Joint probability distribution<sep>Hidden variable theory<sep>Negativity effect<sep>Probabilistic logic<sep>Entropy (arrow of time)<sep>Completeness (order theory)<sep>Gravitation<sep>Inference<sep>Observable<sep>Bayesian inference<sep>Generalized additive model<sep>Bayesian probability<sep>Dark energy<sep>Probability distribution<sep>Upgrade<sep>Quantum nonlocality<sep>Collision<sep>Gravitational constant<sep>Quantum<sep>Quantization (signal processing)<sep>Qubit<sep>Observer (physics)<sep>Cosmological constant<sep>Metric expansion of space<sep>Joint (building)<sep>Unitary state<sep>Classical physics<sep>Hilbert space<sep>Locality<sep>Kochen–Specker theorem<sep>Marginal distribution</keyword><title>Operational approach to bilocality with joint probability distributions<sep>Simulations of quantum nonlocality with local negative bits<sep>Qubit from the classical collision entropy<sep>Qubits from the classical collision entropy<sep>A new look at the Kochen-Specker theorem -- emergence of completeness<sep>Reexamination of the Kochen-Specker theorem: Relaxation of the completeness assumption<sep>Non-classicality Primitive in a Quasi-probabilistic Toy Model<sep>Local Activation of Non-locality With Negative Bits<sep>Observer effect, quasi-probabilities and generalized Specker’s boxes<sep>Quantum Bayesian Inference in Quasiprobability Representations<sep>Dark energy effects in the Schrödinger-Newton approach</title><abstract>We show an operational approach to bilocality with quasi-probability distributions and quasi-stochastic processes. This approach clearly demonstrates that negative probabilities are necessary to violate bilocality.

Notably, unlike the Toner-Bacon protocol, no exchange of classical bits between the observers is required. Moreover, our simulation can be extended to include Popescu-Rohrlich box correlations.<sep>An orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics relies on a set of postulates in Hilbert space supplemented with rules to connect it with classical mechanics such as quantisation techniques, correspondence principle, etc. Here we deduce a qubit and its dynamics straightforwardly from a discrete deterministic dynamics and conservation of the classical collision entropy.

A straightforward consequence is that KS sets do not have joint probability distributions because no set of joint outcomes over such distribution can be constructed. However, we show it is possible to construct a joint quasi-probability distribution over any KS set by relaxing the completeness assumption. Interestingly, completeness is still observable at the level of measurable marginal probability distributions. This suggests the observable completeness might not be a fundamental feature, but an emergent phenomenon.<sep>The Kochen-Specker theorem states that exclusive and complete deterministic outcome assignments are impossible for certain sets of measurements, called Kochen-Specker (KS) sets.

This suggests the observable completeness might not be a fundamental feature, but a secondary property.<sep>We demonstrate a basic non-classical effect in a quasi-probabilistic toy model with local Alice and Bob who share classical randomness. Our scenario differs from the orthodox demonstrations of non-classicality such as violations of Bell inequalities where both local observers have a free will and randomly choose their measurement settings. The core of the argument are modified algorithms by Abramsky and Brandenburger [in Horizons of the Mind, Springer, Cham (2014)], and Pashayan et. al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 070501 (2015)] we use to show that if Bob deterministically performs a quasi-stochastic operation, Alice and Bob require classical communication to simulate it.<sep>We show a purely local protocol to upgrade local realistic correlations to genuine non-local correlations if only one local party has access to a negative probabilistic bit (nebit), i.e., a bit taking $0$ with probability $1+\\Delta$ and $1$ with probability $-\\Delta$. The minimal amount of nebit's negativity $\\Delta$ required for the upgrade can serve as a measure of non-locality. The upgrade protocol bears a striking resemblance to ordinary local unitary operations in quasi-stochastic formulations of quantum theory, mathematically equivalent to positive stochastic processes controlled by nebits. This suggests that nebits can be interpreted as units of quantum departure from classical physics as well.<sep>Quantum non-locality and contextuality can be simulated with quasi-probabilities, i.e. probabilities that take negative values. Here, we show that another quantum phenomenon, the observer effect, admits a quasi-probabilistic description too. We also investigate post-quantum observer effects based on the Specker’s triangle scenario. This scenario comprises three observables, with the possibility of measuring two simultaneously. Represented as three boxes with a hidden ball, this scenario exhibits counterintuitive behaviour: regardless of the chosen pair of boxes, one box always contains the ball. Moreover, the scenario demonstrates a strong observer effect. When an observer selects and opens the first box, finding it empty, the ball is guaranteed to be in the second box, thereby allowing the observer to determine the ball’s location among the remaining two boxes. We extend this scenario to include additional boxes and multiple balls. By employing negative probabilities, we demonstrate amplification of the observer effect. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Quantum contextuality, causality and freedom of choice’.<sep>Bayes’ rule plays a crucial role in logical inference in information and physical sciences alike. Its extension into the quantum regime has been the subject of several recent works. These quantum versions of Bayes’ rule have been expressed in the language of Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we derive the expression for the Petz recovery map within any quasiprobability representation, with explicit formulas for the two canonical choices of “normal quasiprobability representations” (which include discrete-Wigner representations) and of representations based on symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVMs). By using the same mathematical syntax of (quasi)stochastic matrices acting on (quasi)stochastic vectors, the core difference in logical inference between classical and quantum theory is found in the manipulation of the reference prior rather than in the representation of the channel.Received 26 January 2023Accepted 1 June 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.020352Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

On cosmic scales, however, dark energy also acts repulsively, as witnessed by the accelerating rate of universal expansion. Here, we introduce the effects of dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant $\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{\\Lambda}}$, that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe, into the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton approach. We then ask in which regime dark energy dominates both canonical quantum diffusion and gravitational self-attraction. It turns out that this happens for sufficiently delocalized objects with an arbitrary mass and that there exists a minimal delocalization width of about 67 m. While extremely macroscopic from a quantum perspective, the value is in principle accessible to laboratories on Earth. Hence, we analyze, numerically, how the dynamics of an initially spherical Gaussian wave packet is modified in the presence of $\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{\\Lambda}}&gt;0$. A notable feature is the gravitational collapse of part of the wave packet, in the core region close to the center of mass, accompanied by the accelerated expansion of the more distant shell surrounding it. The order of magnitude of the distance separating collapse from expansion matches analytical estimates of the classical turnaround radius for a spherically symmetric body in the presence of dark energy. However, the time required to observe these modifications is astronomical. They can potentially be measured only in physical systems simulating a high effective cosmological constant, or, possibly, via their effects on the inflationary universe.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/358543/visiting-research-professor-south-asia-/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5035147022", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5046666882", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on philosophy, aesthetics, and emotion, which are not aligned with the job description's emphasis on South Asia's international relations, security studies, and peace and conflict resolution.

In this Industry 4.0 setting each step of the robotic assembly sequence is carefully monitored through feedback from each hardware component being relayed to the overall smart factory, where it is located through an IoT messaging protocol. Through this case study, we illustrate how robotics-centered DTs are programmed through simple visual programming blocks, and assisted by detailed simulation, can be a powerful tool for facilitating production in smart factories.<sep>Populating printed circuit boards (PCB) with through-hole-technology (THT) components for small-sized batch productions remains a manual task. Placement of delicate components is inherently difficult, and complexity is added when components are delivered to the system in bulk. Part feeding remains an obstacle in automation, and economically feasible flexible part feeding for electronics components even more so. This paper presents an assembly platform for placement of THT components. The platform handles feeding of components from bulk, tubes, and trays, and features two robotic manipulators for feeding and placement. To simplify the setup task and increase flexibility each component of the system is programmed and designed from digital models and simulation and uncertainties are corrected for during execution.<sep>Feeding parts in automated manufacturing processes lack the adaptation flexibility to rapid production changes, which are typical for small to medium enterprises. In this paper we present a novel application approach for feeding parts, which can be incorporated in small and medium production facilities. The approach relies on a scoop like tool that is attached to a collaborative robot. With the adoption of learning by demonstration methods, part feeding skills can be set-up fast and easy directly on the factory floor by a non-expert user. The approach exploits dynamic movement primitives as an underlying method for representation of trajectories. In the execution phase, we use admittance control with switching force control parameters, defined during the demonstration, for reliable execution of the part feeding skill in contact with the environment. The proposed approach is tested on on several part feeding cases with a Universal Robot UR10e.<sep>Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) requires rigorous safety standards to ensure the safety of the operator. To this end, one promising approach is to install safety-rated sensors in the workcell while considering collaboration methods such as the Safety-rated Monitored Stop (SMS) and Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM). This paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-based workspace monitoring system to implement the approach for safe HRC with both industrial robots (IRs) and collaborative robots (cobots). In the DT framework, the pose of the operator is provided by laser scanners and a body-tracking camera, and the sensor data are processed to calculate the distance between the operator and the hazardous area in order to control the speed of the robots. We carry out experiments to demonstrate the speed scaling function of robots, and the results show that robots can dynamically adapt their movements according to the distance to guarantee a safe environment.<sep>Fast, robust, and flexible part feeding is essential for enabling automation of low volume, high variance assembly tasks. An actuated vision-based solution on a traditional vibratory feeder, referred to here as a vision trap, should in principle be able to meet these demands for a wide range of parts. However, in practice, the flexibility of such a trap is limited as an expert is needed to both identify manageable tasks and to configure the vision system. We propose a novel approach to vision trap design in which the identification of manageable tasks is automatic and the configuration of these tasks can be delegated to an automated feeder design system. We show that the trap's capabilities can be formalized in such a way that it integrates seamlessly into the ecosystem of automated feeder design. Our results on six canonical parts show great promise for autonomous configuration of feeder systems.<sep>Part feeding remains a vital yet troublesome task. This is especially true for flexible manufacturing systems, where classical methods are less applicable due to constraints from small batch sizes and high part variance. In this paper, a novel approach to part feeding is presented, which is targeted at small parts, such as nuts and bolts, that commonly occur in assembly tasks. The approach is an alternative bin picking solution, where parts stored unordered in bins, are oriented and presented for further manipulation using a specially designed tool. The tool is manifested a scoop, which a robot can use to scoop parts from the bins without the use of external sensory input such as vision. Using solely mechanical orienting principles and the motion of the robot, the parts are sorted so only parts in a desired orientation remain in the scoop. The approach is tested on a number of different parts to benchmark its performance.<sep>Simulation of robotic tasks allows for cheap evaluation and process optimization, which can then be transferred to the physical system. To avoid discrepancies between physical execution and simulation, real-world process data can be fed back to the simulation environment, a concept referred to as a \"Digital Twin\". This requires the development of a software architecture, that supports Digital Twins for robot tasks.In this work, we propose a system where an operator can take apart a complex assembly, thus creating digitized assembly instructions. These instructions are then used to visually program the robot setup by blocks, which contain functionality ranging from point-to-point motions to high-level skills. These \"Skillblocks\" allow for a seamless transition between execution in the simulation environment and on the physical robot through interchangeable execution layers in the software architecture. The system also allows for feedback from a physical execution to be monitored in real-time and fed back to the simulation environment for processing.The aim of the system is to close the gap between digital and physical workcells when integrating robot solutions. This increases intuitiveness and allows for process monitoring and optimization through direct feedback to the digital model.<sep>One of the most challenging tasks in automating the design of assembly systems is to automate the feeding process, which consists of singulating parts arriving in bulk, recovering their poses, and presenting them a controlled manner. Vibratory part feeders are the most prevalent feeder type in industry due to their speed and reliability. Recent work has shown great promise in automating the design of vibratory feeders which in a structured manner output parts in one of their natural resting poses. However, robotic assembly operations often require parts to be grasped in a specific orientation for subsequent manipulation. To avoid the need for regrasping prior to assembly, it is essential that the set of poses that parts can be presented in is not restricted to the set of natural resting poses. We present a method for automatically generating trap designs that can rotate parts around the axis of propagation in a controlled manner. The design relies on dynamic simulation and Wilson Score Kernel Density optimization to automatically find suitable trap parameters. We evaluate the trap designs in simulation and demonstrate the desired real world behavior by 3D printing optimized trap designs and testing them on a linear vibratory feeder.<sep>The assembly of parts is a common task in the manufacturing industry. Robotic systems are used to automate repetitive processes, but the long time required for writing and testing programs, limit the application to cases of high-volume production. Modern production systems are expected to quickly adapt to product variants and process changes, and robots should be programmed in a flexible manner to allow for quick reconfiguration. In this paper, we present a method to model assembly tasks in a Digital Twin platform that allows the simulation and control of robots using a Visual Programming editor. We enrich geometric data of parts with 3D frame annotations that are used to design assembly steps. Furthermore, we introduce an interface where each step of the assembly sequence is matched with a ServiceNetwork, a reusable program that can solve a specific task. This produces a sequence of blocks in the Visual Programming editor, where robot poses are generated automatically based on the assembly data. The presented method allows for the flexible reconfiguration of robotic assembly tasks based on digital product data without the need of teaching robot poses. The process is demonstrated by assembling a product in simulation and comparing it with other methods for task reconfiguration.<sep>To support shifting to high mix/low volume production, manufacturers in high wage countries aim for robotizing their production operations – with a special focus on the late production phases, where robotic assembly cells are then confronted with any complexities resulting from part and product varieties. The ‘World Robot Challenge 2018’ (WRC 2018) emulated such high mix/low volume production scenarios in a competition taking place in Tokyo, Japan. As part of our activities in SDU's newly founded I4.0 Lab, we integrated and advanced our experiences and developments from our various R & D projects in a novel robotic assembly cell design to compete in the WRC 2018. This article describes the system architecture as well as main aspects of its implementation regarding robot control, robot programming and computer vision and how they contributed to winning the challenge. Due to the application of collaborative robots, the cell design allows for operation without fences. Hence, multiple copies of the cell can be arranged in a highly reconfigurable, highly adaptable matrix structure in which several production flows can be handled concurrently. This concept was demonstrated by the installation of a duplicate cell that allowed for parallel developments on two cells and prolonged development also after shipping the first cell to Japan.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Semantic data model<sep>Topology (electrical circuits)<sep>Domain (mathematical analysis)<sep>Image (mathematics)<sep>Identification (biology)<sep>Matching (statistics)<sep>Thermal energy storage<sep>Image retrieval<sep>Software deployment<sep>Virtual power plant<sep>Discriminative model<sep>Construct (python library)<sep>Cogeneration<sep>Action recognition<sep>Wind power<sep>Semantic matching<sep>Energy storage<sep>Knowledge transfer<sep>Benchmarking<sep>Robustness (evolution)<sep>Invariant (physics)<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Distributed generation<sep>Decoupling (probability)<sep>Benchmark (surveying)<sep>Personalization<sep>Embedding<sep>Leverage (statistics)<sep>Generalization<sep>Photovoltaic system<sep>Federated learning<sep>Microgrid<sep>Compressed air energy storage</keyword><title>FSAR: Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Adaptive Topology\n  Structure and Knowledge Distillation<sep>FSAR: Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Adaptive Topology Structure and Knowledge Distillation<sep>A remote integrated energy system based on cogeneration of a concentrating solar power plant and buildings with phase change materials<sep>Benchmarking Robustness of Text-Image Composed Retrieval<sep>Exploring Semantic Attributes from A Foundation Model for Federated\n  Learning of Disjoint Label Spaces<sep>Optimal planning of a 100% renewable energy island supply system based on the integration of a concentrating solar power plant and desalination units<sep>Training-free Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval with Local Concept\n  Reranking<sep>Day-ahead offering strategy in the market for concentrating solar power considering thermoelectric decoupling by a compressed air energy storage<sep>Decentralised Person Re-Identification with Selective Knowledge\n  Aggregation</title><abstract>Existing skeleton-based action recognition methods typically follow a centralized learning paradigm, which can pose privacy concerns when exposing human-related videos.

The scheduling ability of a concentrating solar power plant with a thermal storage system is better than that of a photovoltaic plant; however, the high investment limits its application compared with a photovoltaic plant. Therefore, an integrated energy system is proposed in this paper. A combined heat and power unit and a concentrating solar power plant are assembled together to improve the thermal energy utilization. Buildings integrated with phase change materials are designed for heating and cooling storage; they provide energy savings of indoor loads and facilitate the efficient operation of conventional units. In addition, the coordinated day-ahead scheduling of the integrated system is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model given as the minimization of operation cost. The case studies compare several energy supply modes with different forms of electricity and heating supplies. Results are in favor of the coordinated approach that shows better cost-effectiveness and development potential of the proposed energy supply mode.<sep>Text-image composed retrieval aims to retrieve the target image through the composed query, which is specified in the form of an image plus some text that describes desired modifications to the input image. It has recently attracted attention due to its ability to leverage both information-rich images and concise language to precisely express the requirements for target images. However, the robustness of these approaches against real-world corruptions or further text understanding has never been studied. In this paper, we perform the first robustness study and establish three new diversified benchmarks for systematic analysis of text-image composed retrieval against natural corruptions in both vision and text and further probe textural understanding. For natural corruption analysis, we introduce two new large-scale benchmark datasets, CIRR-C and FashionIQ-C for testing in open domain and fashion domain respectively, both of which apply 15 visual corruptions and 7 textural corruptions. For textural understanding analysis, we introduce a new diagnostic dataset CIRR-D by expanding the original raw data with synthetic data, which contains modified text to better probe textual understanding ability including numerical variation, attribute variation, object removal, background variation, and fine-grained evaluation. The code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/SunTongtongtong/Benchmark-Robustness-Text-Image-Compose-Retrieval.<sep>Conventional centralised deep learning paradigms are not feasible when data from different sources cannot be shared due to data privacy or transmission limitation. To resolve this problem, federated learning has been introduced to transfer knowledge across multiple sources (clients) with non-shared data while optimising a globally generalised central model (server). Existing federated learning paradigms mostly focus on transferring holistic high-level knowledge (such as class) across models, which are closely related to specific objects of interest so may suffer from inverse attack. In contrast, in this work, we consider transferring mid-level semantic knowledge (such as attribute) which is not sensitive to specific objects of interest and therefore is more privacy-preserving and scalable. To this end, we formulate a new Federated Zero-Shot Learning (FZSL) paradigm to learn mid-level semantic knowledge at multiple local clients with non-shared local data and cumulatively aggregate a globally generalised central model for deployment. To improve model discriminative ability, we propose to explore semantic knowledge augmentation from external knowledge for enriching the mid-level semantic space in FZSL. Extensive experiments on five zeroshot learning benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach for optimising a generalisable federated learning model with mid-level semantic knowledge transfer.<sep>Environmental-unfriendly power supply mode and freshwater shortage are two main problems for isolated islands. A 100% renewable energy supply system equipped with local desalination units is an effective solution to the above problems. It can save fuel supplies and eliminate pollutant emissions. Firstly, a 100% renewable energy supply system based on wind turbines and the integration of a concentrating solar power (CSP) plant and desalination units is proposed in this paper. The flexible schedulability of CSP plants is utilized to complement to wind power generation, and the thermal storage system reduces the battery energy storage configuration for islands. Different from the conventional method of seeking the minimum levelized cost of CSP from limited capacity combinations, an optimal planning model is established to achieve the minimum overall costs of the 100% renewable energy system. In addition, the adjustable output characteristic of CSP is also considered as the decision variables to optimize the operation of the microgrid. The model is linearized to a mixed integer linear programming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed supply system improves the efficiency of renewable energy utilization and capacity factors of generation units; the peak load demand is cut down and the capacity configuration of generation units is also reduced. The comparison with other state-of-art systems shows that the cost-effectiveness of the proposed system is better in areas with abundant renewable energy resources and high fuel costs.<sep>Composed image retrieval attempts to retrieve an image of interest from gallery images through a composed query of a reference image and its corresponding modified text. It has recently attracted attention due to the collaboration of information-rich images and concise language to precisely express the requirements of target images. Most of the existing composed image retrieval methods follow a supervised learning paradigm to perform training on a costly triplet dataset composed of a reference image, modified text, and a corresponding target image. To alleviate the demand for difficult-to-obtain labeled triplet data, recent methods have introduced zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR), which aims to retrieve the target image without the supervision of human-labeled triplets but instead relies on image-text pairs or self-generated triplets. However, these methods are less computationally efficient due to the requirement of training and also less understandable, assuming that the interaction between image and text is conducted with implicit query embedding. In this work, we present a new Training-Free zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (TFCIR) method which translates the query into explicit human-understandable text. This helps improve computation efficiency while maintaining the generalization of foundation models. Further, we introduce a Local Concept Reranking (LCR) mechanism to focus on discriminative local information extracted from the modified instruction. Extensive experiments on three ZS-CIR benchmarks show that the proposed approach can achieve comparable performances with state-of-the-art methods and significantly outperforms other training-free methods on the open domain datasets, CIRR and CIRCO, as well as the fashion domain dataset, FashionIQ.<sep>Due to limited fossil fuel resources, a growing increase in energy demand and the need to maintain positive environmental effects, concentrating solar power (CSP) plant as a promising technology has driven the world to find new sustainable and competitive methods for energy production. The scheduling capability of a CSP plant equipped with thermal energy storage (TES) surpasses a photovoltaic (PV) unit and augments the sustainability of energy system performance. However, restricting CSP plant application compared to a PV plant due to its high investment is a challenging issue. This paper presents a model to assemble a combined heat and power (CHP) with a CSP plant for enhancing heat utilization and reduce the overall cost of the plant, thus, the CSP benefits proved by researches can be implemented more economically. Moreover, the compressed air energy storage (CAES) is used with a CSP-TES-CHP plant in order that the thermoelectric decoupling of the CHP be facilitated. Therefore, the virtual power plant (VPP) created is a suitable design for large power grids, which can trade heat and electricity in response to the market without restraint by thermoelectric constraint. Furthermore, the day-ahead offering strategy of the VPP is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem with the goal of maximizing the profit in the market. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed model. The proposed VPP has a 2% increase in profit and a maximum 6% increase in the market electricity price per day compared to the system without CAES.<sep>Existing person re-identification (Re-ID) methods mostly follow a centralised learning paradigm which shares all training data to a collection for model learning. This paradigm is limited when data from different sources cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. To resolve this problem, two recent works have introduced decentralised (federated) Re-ID learning for constructing a globally generalised model (server)without any direct access to local training data nor shared data across different source domains (clients). However, these methods are poor on how to adapt the generalised model to maximise its performance on individual client domain Re-ID tasks having different Re-ID label spaces, due to a lack of understanding of data heterogeneity across domains. We call this poor 'model personalisation'. In this work, we present a new Selective Knowledge Aggregation approach to decentralised person Re-ID to optimise the trade-off between model personalisation and generalisation. Specifically, we incorporate attentive normalisation into the normalisation layers in a deep ReID model and propose to learn local normalisation layers specific to each domain, which are decoupled from the global model aggregation in federated Re-ID learning. This helps to preserve model personalisation knowledge on each local client domain and learn instance-specific information. Further, we introduce a dual local normalisation mechanism to learn generalised normalisation layers in each local model, which are then transmitted to the global model for central aggregation. This facilitates selective knowledge aggregation on the server to construct a global generalised model for out-of-the-box deployment on unseen novel domains. Extensive experiments on eight person Re-ID datasets show that the proposed approach to decentralised Re-ID significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralised methods.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/126158/phd-candidate-in-big-data-management-and-science/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5055660203", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5077534756", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates strong expertise in robotics, automation, and digital twins, which aligns well with the job's focus on big data management and cloud computing, particularly in the context of infrastructure-aware systems.

Here, using whole-genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing of 2,754 childhood patients with ALL, we find that, despite a generally low mutation burden, ALL cases harbor a median of four putative somatic driver alterations per sample, with 376 putative driver genes identified varying in prevalence across ALL subtypes. Most samples harbor at least one rare gene alteration, including 70 putative cancer driver genes associated with ubiquitination, SUMOylation, noncoding transcripts and other functions. In hyperdiploid B-ALL, chromosomal gains are acquired early and synchronously before ultraviolet-induced mutation. By contrast, ultraviolet-induced mutations precede chromosomal gains in B-ALL cases with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21. We also demonstrate the prognostic significance of genetic alterations within subtypes. Intriguingly, DUX4- and KMT2A-rearranged subtypes separate into CEBPA/FLT3- or NFATC4-expressing subgroups with potential clinical implications. Together, these results deepen understanding of the ALL genomic landscape and associated outcomes.<sep>Abstract Current strategies to treat pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia rely on risk stratification algorithms using categorical data. We investigated whether using continuous variables assigned different weights would improve risk stratification. We developed and validated a multivariable Cox model for relapse-free survival (RFS) using information from 21199 patients. We constructed risk groups by identifying cutoffs of the COG Prognostic Index (PI COG ) that maximized discrimination of the predictive model. Patients with higher PI COG have higher predicted relapse risk. The PI COG reliably discriminates patients with low vs. high relapse risk. For those with moderate relapse risk using current COG risk classification, the PI COG identifies subgroups with varying 5-year RFS. Among current COG standard-risk average patients, PI COG identifies low and intermediate risk groups with 96% and 90% RFS, respectively. Similarly, amongst current COG high-risk patients, PI COG identifies four groups ranging from 96% to 66% RFS, providing additional discrimination for future treatment stratification. When coupled with traditional algorithms, the novel PI COG can more accurately risk stratify patients, identifying groups with better outcomes who may benefit from less intensive therapy, and those who have high relapse risk needing innovative approaches for cure.<sep>Hyperdiploidy with greater than 50 chromosomes is usually associated with favorable prognosis in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas hypodiploidy with ≤43 chromosomes is associated with extremely poor prognosis. Sometimes, hypodiploidy is \"masked\" and patients do not have a karyotypically visible clone with ≤43 chromosomes. Instead, their abnormal karyotypes contain 50-78 or more chromosomes from doubling of previously hypodiploid cells. When the hypodiploid and doubled hyperdiploid clones are both present, patients can be identified by traditional test methods [karyotype, DNA Index (DI), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)], but the incidence of masked hypodiploid cases in which only the doubled clone is visible is unknown. We analyzed 7013 patients with B-ALL enrolled in COG AALL03B1 (2003-2011) for whom chromosome studies were available. Of 115 patients with hypodiploidy (25-39 chromosomes), karyotypes of 40 showed only the hypodiploid clone, 47 showed mosaicism with both hypodiploid and hyperdiploid (doubled) karyotypes, and 28 with masked hypodiploidy showed only a hyperdiploid (doubled) clone. Unique karyotypic signatures were identified, and widespread loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was seen in the microsatellite panel for all patients with masked hypodiploidy. An increased awareness of the unusual karyotypic profile associated with a doubled hypodiploid clone and coordinated use of DI, FISH, and LOH studies when indicated can identify patients with masked hypodiploidy and allow appropriate treatment selection.<sep>PURPOSE Chemotherapy outcomes in older patients with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome–negative B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are very poor. Here, we evaluated blinatumomab as induction and consolidation therapy followed by prednisone, vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate (POMP) maintenance chemotherapy in this patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were treated at National Clinical Trial Network sites. Eligibility criteria included age ≥ 65 years and newly diagnosed Ph chromosome–negative B-ALL. Patients received blinatumomab as induction for one-two cycles until attainment of response (complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery). Patients then received three cycles of consolidation with blinatumomab followed by 18 months of POMP maintenance chemotherapy. Eight doses of intrathecal methotrexate were administered as central nervous system prophylaxis. RESULTS Twenty-nine eligible patients were enrolled. The median age was 75 years, and the median bone marrow blast count at diagnosis was 87%. Cytogenetic risk was poor in 10 patients (34%), and five of 14 patients (36%) tested had the Ph-like ALL gene signature. Nineteen patients (66%; 95% CI, 46 to 82) achieved CR. Kaplan-Meier 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival estimates were 37% (95% CI, 17 to 57) and 37% (95% CI, 20 to 55), respectively. CONCLUSION Blinatumomab was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of older patients with newly diagnosed Ph chromosome–negative B-ALL, including patients with poor-risk cytogenetics. The 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival results are encouraging and suggest that this approach should be further explored.<sep>Abstract Retrospective studies have suggested that older adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have better survival rates when treated using a pediatric ALL regimen administered by pediatric treatment teams. To address the feasibility and efficacy of using a pediatric treatment regimen for AYA patients with newly diagnosed ALL administered by adult treatment teams, we performed a prospective study, CALGB 10403, with doses and schedule identical to those in the Children’s Oncology Group study AALL0232. From 2007 to 2012, 318 patients were enrolled; 295 were eligible and evaluable for response. Median age was 24 years (range, 17-39 years). Use of the pediatric regimen was safe; overall treatment-related mortality was 3%, and there were only 2 postremission deaths. Median event-free survival (EFS) was 78.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.8 to not reached), more than double the historical control of 30 months (95% CI, 22-38 months); 3-year EFS was 59% (95% CI, 54%-65%). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Estimated 3-year OS was 73% (95% CI, 68%-78%). Pretreatment risk factors associated with worse treatment outcomes included obesity and presence of the Philadelphia-like gene expression signature. Use of a pediatric regimen for AYAs with ALL up to age 40 years was feasible and effective, resulting in improved survival rates compared with historical controls. CALGB 10403 can be considered a new treatment standard upon which to build for improving survival for AYAs with ALL. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00558519.<sep>Genomic classification has improved risk assignment of pediatric, but not adult B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The international UKALLXII/ECOG-ACRIN E2993 (#NCT00002514) trial accrued 1229 adolescent/adult patients with BCR-ABL1- B-ALL (aged 14 to 65 years). Although 93% of patients achieved remission, 41% relapsed at a median of 13 months (range, 28 days to 12 years). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 42% (95% confidence interval, 39, 44). Transcriptome sequencing, gene expression profiling, cytogenetics, and fusion polymerase chain reaction enabled genomic subtyping of 282 patient samples, of which 264 were eligible for trial, accounting for 64.5% of E2993 patients. Among patients with outcome data, 29.5% with favorable outcomes (5-year OS 65% to 80%) were deemed standard risk (DUX4-rearranged [9.2%], ETV6-RUNX1/-like [2.3%], TCF3-PBX1 [6.9%], PAX5 P80R [4.1%], high-hyperdiploid [6.9%]); 50.2% had high-risk genotypes with 5-year OS of 0% to 27% (Ph-like [21.2%], KMT2A-AFF1 [12%], low-hypodiploid/near-haploid [14.3%], BCL2/MYC-rearranged [2.8%]); 20.3% had intermediate-risk genotypes with 5-year OS of 33% to 45% (PAX5alt [12.4%], ZNF384/-like [5.1%], MEF2D-rearranged [2.8%]). IKZF1 alterations occurred in 86% of Ph-like, and TP53 mutations in patients who were low-hypodiploid (54%) and BCL2/MYC-rearranged (33%) but were not independently associated with outcome. Of patients considered high risk based on presenting age and white blood cell count, 40% harbored subtype-defining genetic alterations associated with standard- or intermediate-risk outcomes. We identified distinct immunophenotypic features for DUX4-rearranged, PAX5 P80R, ZNF384-R/-like, and Ph-like genotypes. These data in a large adult B-ALL cohort treated with a non-risk-adapted approach on a single trial show the prognostic importance of genomic analyses, which may translate into future therapeutic benefits.<sep>Abstract Although B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and while highly curable, it remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The outgrowth of tumor subclones carrying mutations in genes responsible for resistance to therapy has led to a Darwinian model of clonal selection. Previous work has indicated that alterations in the epigenome might contribute to clonal selection, yet the extent to which the chromatin state is altered under the selective pressures of therapy is unknown. To address this, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation, gene expression analysis, and enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on a cohort of paired diagnosis and relapse samples from individual patients who all but one relapsed within 36 months of initial diagnosis. The chromatin state at diagnosis varied widely among patients, while the majority of peaks remained stable between diagnosis and relapse. Yet a significant fraction was either lost or newly gained, with some patients showing few differences and others showing massive changes of the epigenetic state. Evolution of the epigenome was associated with pathways previously linked to therapy resistance as well as novel candidate pathways through alterations in pyrimidine biosynthesis and downregulation of polycomb repressive complex 2 targets. Three novel, relapse-specific superenhancers were shared by a majority of patients including one associated with S100A8, the top upregulated gene seen at relapse in childhood B-ALL. Overall, our results support a role of the epigenome in clonal evolution and uncover new candidate pathways associated with relapse. Significance: This study suggests a major role for epigenetic mechanisms in driving clonal evolution in B-ALL and identifies novel pathways associated with drug resistance.<sep>PURPOSE Patients with Down syndrome (DS) and B-ALL experience increased rates of relapse, toxicity, and death. We report results for patients with DS B-ALL enrolled on Children's Oncology Group trials between 2003 and 2019. METHODS We analyzed data for DS (n = 743) and non-DS (n = 20,067) patients age 1-30 years on four B-ALL standard-risk (SR) and high-risk trials. RESULTS Patients with DS exhibited more frequent minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥0.01% at end induction (30.8% v 21.5%; P &lt; .001). This difference persisted at end consolidation only in National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk patients (34.0% v 11.7%; P &lt; .0001). Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly poorer for DS versus non-DS patients overall (EFS, 79.2% ± 1.6% v 87.5% ± 0.3%; P &lt; .0001; OS, 86.8% ± 1.4% v 93.6% ± 0.2%; P &lt; .0001), and within NCI SR and high-risk subgroups. Multivariable Cox regression analysis of the DS cohort for risk factors associated with inferior EFS identified age &gt;10 years, white blood count &gt;50 × 10 3 /μL, and end-induction MRD ≥0.01%, but not cytogenetics or CRLF2 overexpression. Patients with DS demonstrated higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (11.5% ± 1.2% v 9.1% ± 0.2%; P = .0008), death in remission (4.9% ± 0.8% v 1.7% ± 0.1%; P &lt; .0001), and induction death (3.4% v 0.8%; P &lt; .0001). Mucositis, infections, and hyperglycemia were significantly more frequent in all patients with DS, while seizures were more frequent in patients with DS on high-risk trials (4.1% v 1.8%; P = .005). CONCLUSION Patients with DS-ALL exhibit an increased rate of relapse and particularly of treatment-related mortality. Novel, less-toxic therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes.<sep>Background: Approximately 2-3% of B-ALL patients have Philadelphia chromosome like (Ph-like) B-ALL with an ABL-class fusion ( ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRB, or CSF1R fusions), but lacking BCR::ABL1. These patients are predicted to be sensitive to ABL-class tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib or dasatinib. Ph-like B-ALL is associated with male sex, older age, higher initial white blood cell (WBC) count, elevated end of induction (EOI) minimal residual disease (MRD), and poor outcome. The AALL1131 Dasatinib arm was designed to evaluate response to therapy following induction of patients with ABL-class fusion B-ALL, when given dasatinib continuously on a modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (MBFM) backbone. Methods: Between February 2012 and March 2019, AALL1131 enrolled patients 1-30 years with newly diagnosed high risk (HR) B-ALL. AALL1131 was amended in August 2016, to include the Dasatinib arm for patients with ABL-class fusions involving ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRB, and CSF1R. Patients with Down Syndrome were not eligible for the Dasatinib arm. ABL-class fusion B-ALL patients with a predicted TKI-sensitive mutation were screened by low density array (LDA) PCR and confirmed by additional molecular testing. Following 4-drug induction, patients with HR B-ALL and ABL-class fusions received MBFM with dasatinib (60 mg/m 2, maximum 140 mg) daily from start of consolidation through end of maintenance. Dasatinib was held only for toxicity. Results: Twenty-two evaluable patients with HR B-ALL were non-randomly assigned to the Dasatinib arm. ABL-class 3' partners included ABL1 (n=4), ABL2 (n=4), PDGFRB (n=12), and CSF1R (n=2). Compared to all patients on AALL1131, patients treated on the Dasatinib arm were older (median age at diagnosis 14 versus 10 years, p=0.008), more often male (77% versus 56%, p=0.046), and had a trend towards an increased initial WBC (median WBC at diagnosis 44,000/µL versus 19,000/µL, p=0.086). Patients with ABL-class fusions had EOI MRD &amp;gt; 0.01% in 20 of 22 patients and available end of consolidation MRD &amp;gt;0.01% in 6 of 10 patients. Only 5 of 22 (22.7%) patients completed prescribed protocol therapy. Reasons for therapy discontinuation included induction failure (n=2), relapse (n=1), alternate therapy (n=1), determined to be in the patient's best interest (n=10), death (n=1), unknown (n=2). Compared to all patients on AALL1131, four-year disease-free survival was 52.5+18.1% versus 86.8+0.7% (p&amp;lt;0.0001) and overall survival 79.4+13.6% versus 89.2+0.4% (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Dasatinib was well tolerated with no unexpected treatment related toxicities. Conclusion: Patients with ABL-class fusions were more likely male, EOI MRD+, and had poorer outcomes. Seventy-seven percent of patients enrolled on the Dasatinib arm did not complete prescribed therapy. While dasatinib was well tolerated, treatment failures occurred early, indicating alternate strategies are needed.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Disease<sep>Epigenetics<sep>Risk factor<sep>Public health<sep>CpG site<sep>Mortality rate<sep>Moraxella<sep>Global health<sep>Antigen<sep>Immunization<sep>DNA methylation<sep>Rhinovirus<sep>Palivizumab<sep>Wheeze<sep>Retrospective cohort study<sep>Interquartile range<sep>Asthma<sep>Methylation<sep>Moraxella catarrhalis</keyword><title>Infant RSV immunoprophylaxis changes nasal epithelial DNA methylation at 6 years of age<sep>Infant RSV immunoprophylaxis changes nasal epithelial DNA methylation at six years of age<sep>Infant RSV infection changes nasal epithelial DNA methylation at 6 years of age<sep>Infant RSV prophylaxis, RSV infection, and nasopharyngeal microbiota at age six years<sep>Nosocomial RSV-related In-hospital Mortality in Children &lt;5 Years: A Global Case Series<sep>Respiratory Syncytial Virus-related Death in Children With Down Syndrome</title><abstract>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has been associated with childhood wheeze and asthma, and potential mechanisms include persistent epigenetic effects.In the randomized, placebo-controlled MAKI trial, 429 preterm infants randomly received RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab or placebo during their first RSV season.

Methods In the randomized, placebo-controlled MAKI trial, 429 preterm infants randomly received RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab or placebo during their first RSV season. Children were followed until age 6 for asthma evaluation. DNA methylation in cells obtained by nasal brushes at age 6 was measured by Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Results RSV immunoprophylaxis in infancy had significant impact on global methylation patterns in nasal cells at age 6. The first principal component related to the immunoprophylaxis intervention was enriched for the pathway “positive regulation of defense response to virus by host” and “antigen processing and presentation” and driven by methylation changes in NOD2, DGKG, MSH3 , and ITPR2 . Three CpGsites, cg18040241, cg08243963, cg19555973 were differentially methylated at genome-wide significance, but were not associated with asthma. Differential methylation region analysis identified regions near genes that were previously implicated in the development of asthma and allergy such as HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, FASLG , and CHI3L1 . Conclusions The study provides the first proof of concept that RSV immunoprophylaxis during infancy has long-term effects on nasal epigenetic signatures at age 6, relating to host antiviral defense pathways.<sep><b>Objective:</b> Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has been associated with childhood wheeze and asthma development, and potential mechanisms include persistent epigenetic effects. This study is to understand the link between RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, DNA methylation changes, and asthma development. <b>Methods:</b> In the randomized, placebo-controlled MAKI trial, 332 preterm infants randomly received RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab or placebo during their first RSV season. Children were followed until age 6 for asthma evaluation. We used Illumina MethylationEPIC array to measure DNA methylation in the nasal epithelium at age 6. <b>Results:</b> RSV immunoprophylaxis in infancy had significant impact on methylation patterns in the nasal epithelium at age 6 (Overall methylation differences P=0.0055). The principal component related to the immunoprophylaxis intervention was enriched for the pathway “positive regulation of defense response to virus by host” and “antigen processing and presentation” and driven by methylation changes in <i>NOD2</i>, <i>DGKG</i>, <i>MSH3</i>, and <i>ITPR2</i>. Three CpGsites in cg18040241, cg08243963, cg19555973 were differentially methylated at genome-wide significance. These CpGsites were not associated with asthma. Differential methylation region analysis identified regions near genes that were previously implicated in the development of asthma and allergy such as <i>HLA-DPA1</i>, <i>HLA-DPB1</i>, <i>FASLG</i>, and <i>CHI3L1</i>. <b>Conclusions:</b> The study shows that RSV infection during infancy has a long-term effect on nasal epigenetic signatures at age 6. We conclude that early life respiratory infections may have persistent effects on gene function in host antiviral defense pathways. <b>Funding:</b> MedImmune grant ESR-14-10006<sep><b>Background:</b> Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during infancy is suggested to cause long-term wheeze. In turn, wheeze has been associated with bacterial dysbiosis of the respiratory tract. We investigated the effects of RSV prophylaxis by palivizumab during infancy on respiratory microbiota composition at six years of age in participants of an RCT. <b>Methods:</b> 429 infants born between 32-35 weeks of gestation randomly received palivizumab or placebo during the RSV season of their first year of life. Children were followed for clinical symptoms until 6 years of age. At age six, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and reversible airway obstruction was determined. Samples of 395 children were available for 16S-rRNA sequencing. <b>Findings:</b> We observed that RSV prophylaxis in infancy was associated with a higher abundance of <i>Haemophilus</i> and lower abundance of <i>Moraxella</i> and <i>Neisseria</i>, at age six years. Stratified analysis comparing microbiota at age six of children with PCR-confirmed RSV infection to children without proven RSV infection in infancy showed similar microbiota associations compared to those found with RSV prophylaxis. PCR-confirmed rhinovirus infection in infancy partly negated the impact of PCR-confirmed RSV infection on respiratory microbiota at age six. Reversible airway obstruction at age six was positively associated with <i>Haemophilus</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i> abundance and negatively associated with the abundance of health-associated spp., e.g. <i>Moraxella</i>, <i>Neisseria</i>, <i>Corynebacterium</i> and <i>Dolosigranulum</i>. <b>Interpretation:</b> Together, our results warrant further studies to shed light on the long-term ecological effects of viral infections and (RSV) prophylaxis in infancy.<sep>According to the World Health Organization, the global burden of nosocomial infections is poorly characterized as surveillance systems are lacking. Nosocomial infections occur at higher rates in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries (HICs). Current global RSV burden estimates are largely based on community-acquired infection. We aimed to characterize children with nosocomial RSV-related mortality and to understand the potential impact of RSV immunization strategies.RSV GOLD is a global registry of children younger than 5 years who died with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. We compared clinical and demographic characteristics of children with nosocomial and community-acquired RSV in-hospital mortality.We included 231 nosocomial and 931 community-acquired RSV-related in-hospital from deaths from 65 countries. Age at death was similar for both groups (5.4 vs. 6 months). A higher proportion of nosocomial deaths had comorbidities (87% vs. 57%; P < 0.001) or was born preterm (46% vs. 24%; P < 0.001) than community-acquired deaths. The proportion of nosocomial deaths among all RSV deaths was lower in LMICs than in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) and HICs (12% vs. 18% and 26%, respectively).This is the first global case series of children dying with nosocomial RSV infection. Future infant-targeted immunization strategies could prevent the majority of nosocomial RSV-related deaths. Although nosocomial RSV deaths are expected to occur at highest rates in LMICs, the number of reported nosocomial RSV deaths was low in these countries. Hospital-based surveillance is needed to capture the full burden of nosocomial RSV mortality in LMICs.<sep>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of mortality in children younger than 5 years worldwide. Systematic reviews have shown that Down syndrome (DS) is an independent risk factor for severe RSV infection. We aimed to describe demographic and clinical characteristics of children with DS who died with RSV infection.We performed a retrospective case series in which data were shared by individual researchers, research networks and physicians worldwide as part of the RSV Global Online Database study. We included children with DS who died when younger than 5 years of age with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection.We included 53 children with DS and RSV-related mortality from 20 countries in 5 continents. Five (9.4%) children were from low-income or lower-middle-income countries. Median age at time of death was 6.0 months [interquartile range (IQR): 3.00-12.0]. Thirteen (24.5%) children were born term and had no other risk factors for severe RSV disease. In total, 36 (67.9%) children had congenital heart disease, 8 (15.1%) had chronic lung disease and 1 (1.9%) had congenital immunodeficiency. Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for children with DS compared with children without DS [median length of stay, 13 days (IQR: 6.8-21.0) vs. 8 days (IQR: 3.0-18.5), P=0.005].One-fourth of children with DS and RSV-confirmed death did not have risk factors for severe RSV disease, indicating that DS is an important risk factor for RSV-related mortality. Age distribution at time of death demonstrates that maternal vaccination would not be sufficient to protect children with DS against RSV-related mortality.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/48074/research-assistant-national-drug-and-alcohol-research-centre/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5070576060", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5047425240", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A has a strong background in hematology and oncology, particularly in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is not directly relevant to the POINT study on opioid therapy for chronic pain.

In this paper, we develop a novel method for the six-phase PMSM (6PPMSM) position servo drive based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). Comparison studies between the proposed controller and the recurrent fuzzy neural cerebellar model articulation network (RFNCMAN) controller are presented. The results show that our controller can follow the reference trajectories more precisely in general cases, where the average tracking error obtained is 90% smaller than that of RFNCMAN.<sep>A real-time moment of inertia identification technique using wavelet fuzzy neural network (WFNN) for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) servo drive is proposed in this study. The estimated moment of inertia will be used in the online design of an integral-proportional (IP) speed controller to achieve the gains auto-tuning of the IPMSM servo drive. In this study, first, the dynamic analysis of a field-oriented control (FOC) IPMSM servo drive system with an IP speed controller is studied. Then, a heuristic approach using the WFNN is proposed for the real-time identification of the moment of inertia of the IPMSM servo drive system. Moreover, the network structure and the convergence analysis of the WFNN are introduced. Furthermore, an IPMSM servo drive based on a high performance digital signal processor (DSP) is developed. Finally, from the experimental results, the gains of the IP speed controller can be effectively tuned online at different operating conditions.<sep>In this article, a real-time moment of inertia identification technique using Petri probabilistic fuzzy neural network with an asymmetric membership function (PPFNN-AMF) for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) servo drive is proposed. The estimated moment of inertia will be used in the online design of an integral–proportional (IP) speed controller to achieve the gains autotuning of the IPMSM servo drive. In the proposed method, the dynamic analysis of a field-oriented control IPMSM servo drive system with an IP speed controller is constructed first. Then, a heuristic approach using the PPFNN-AMF is proposed for the real-time identification of the moment of inertia of the IPMSM servo drive system. Moreover, the network structure and the convergence analysis of the PPFNN-AMF are devised and derivated. Furthermore, an IPMSM servo drive based on a high-performance digital signal processor is developed. Finally, from the experimental results, the gains of the IP speed controller can be tuned online effectively at different operating conditions with robust control characteristics.<sep>To develop a high-efficiency synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive system, a novel maximum power factor control (MPFC), which is based on current angle control with stator flux and stator resistance estimators, is proposed in this study. First, a conventional maximum power factor control (CMPFC) system using a saliency ratio of the SynRM to generate a fixed current angle command is introduced. Since the saliency ratio needs offline pre-preparation and can't be adjusted automatically, it is difficult to improve the performance of the MPFC in different operating region owing to the increasing of manufacturing cost and time-consuming. Therefore, an online maximum power factor searching control (MPFSC) based on current angle control is designed for the speed control of a SynRM. Moreover, a proportional-integral (PI) speed controller is adopted to generate the stator current command, and the proposed online MPFSC is employed to produce the current angle command. Finally, from the experimental results, the current angles of the optimal power factor (PF) can be effectively obtained online at different speed and load torque conditions.<sep>The design and analysis of a novel current angle-based adaptive backstepping (ABS) speed control system for a synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive system is presented in this article. First, a proportional-integral control system with field-oriented control is described. Owing to the unmodeled dynamics and magnetic saturation effects of the SynRM, currently, there is no predominant way to design the command of the d-axis current for the SynRM. Therefore, an ABS based on the current angle control (ABS-CAC) system is designed for the speed tracking of SynRM. The ABS speed tracking control is proposed to generate the stator current command, and a lookup table of the results of maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) analysis by using the finite element analysis method is proposed to provide the current angle commands. Moreover, to improve the transient dynamic response of SynRM under MTPA operating conditions, an intelligent speed transient control system using a recurrent Hermite fuzzy neural network is developed to generate the compensated current angle command. The proposed intelligent ABS-CAC is implemented in a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor TMS320F28075. Finally, some experimental results are provided to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control system.<sep>In order to design a high-performance synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive system, a novel adaptive complementary sliding mode (ACSM) speed control and an effective <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i> -axis current control (EDCC) are proposed in this article. First, a classical proportional-integral based field-oriented control of the SynRM drive with a constant <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i> -axis current command is introduced. However, the constant <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i> -axis current command is obtained by trial and error method or satisfying the minimum excitation current of the SynRM. More importantly, the constant value of the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i> -axis current command is not suitable for the highly nonlinear and time-varying SynRM drive at the varied load torque conditions. Therefore, an ACSM speed control with the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i> -axis current control (ACSMSC-DCC) system is designed for the speed regulation of the SynRM. The ACSM speed control is proposed to generate the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i> -axis current commands, and an EDCC by using the stator flux estimator is proposed to produce the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i> -axis current commands. Finally, the proposed ACSMSC-DCC system is implemented in a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor TMS320F28075 and its effectiveness are verified by some experimental results.<sep>To develop a high-performance synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive system, a novel maximum power factor control (MPFC) using a current angle controller with stator resistance and stator flux estimators is proposed. First, a traditional maximum power factor control system using a saliency ratio of the SynRM to generate a fixed current angle command is described. Since the saliency ratio requires offline prepreparation and cannot be adjusted automatically, it is difficult to improve the performance of the MPFC in different operating regions because of the increasing of manufacturing cost and time-consumption. Therefore, an intelligent-maximum power factor searching control (MPFSC) using a recurrent Chebyshev fuzzy neural network (RCFNN) current angle controller is developed for the speed control of a SynRM. In order to search the online optimal power factor (PF) points of the SynRM under different operating conditions, the RCFNN current angle controller is designed to produce the compensated current angle command. Moreover, a proportional-integral speed controller is adopted to generate the stator current magnitude command, and the proposed intelligent-MPFSC is employed to generate the current angle command. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent-MPFSC system is implemented in a 32-bit floating-point TMS320F28075 digital signal processor. Finally, from the experimental results, the current angle commands of the optimal PF can be effectively obtained online at different speed operating commands with varied load torque.<sep>The synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) is a high-efficiency and low-cost motor with rugged structure. However, the nonlinear and time-varying control characteristics of the SynRM with high torque ripple confine the high-performance applications of this motor. Therefore, an intelligent backstepping control (BSC) using recurrent feature selection fuzzy neural network is proposed to construct a high-performance SynRM position servo drive system. First, the dynamic model of a vector control SynRM position servo drive is introduced. Second, a BSC system is designed for the tracking of the position reference. Since the lumped uncertainty of the SynRM position servo drive system is unavailable in advance, it is very difficult to design an effective BSC in practical applications. Moreover, the sign function in BSC will cause undesired chattering phenomenon, which will excite unknown dynamics and wear the ball bearing of the SynRM. To alleviate the existed difficulties in the BSC, the recurrent feature selection fuzzy neural network (RFSFNN) is proposed in this study to approximate an idea BSC. In addition, to compensate the possible approximated error of the RFSFNN, an improved adaptive compensator is augmented. The online learning algorithms of the RFSFNN are derived by using the Lyapunov stability method to assure asymptotical stability. Finally, the proposed control system is implemented in a 32-bit floating point digital signal processor. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed intelligent BSC system are verified by some experimental results.<sep>In order to construct a high-performance synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive system, an intelligent maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) tracking control using a recurrent Legendre fuzzy neural network (RLFNN) is proposed in this study. First, a traditional MTPA (TMTPA) control system based on FOC is introduced. Since the reluctance torque of the SynRM is highly nonlinear and time-varying, the MTPA tracking control is very difficult to achieve by using the TMTPA control in practical applications. Then, an adaptive computed current (ACC) speed control using the proposed RLFNN for the MTPA tracking control of a SynRM drive system, which does not use a lookup table and can effectively obtain the optimal current angle command of MTPA online, is described in detail. The ACC speed control is applied to generate the stator current magnitude command, and an adaptation law is proposed to online adapt the value of a lumped uncertainty in the ACC control. Moreover, the adaptation law is derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the ACC speed control. Furthermore, the proposed RLFNN is employed to produce the incremental command of the current angle. In addition, the ACC speed control and RLFNN are implemented in a TMS320F28075 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor for a 4 kW SynRM drive system. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed intelligent MTPA tracking control are verified by some experimental results.<sep>An intelligent servo drive system for a permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motor (PMASynRM) that can adapt to the control requirements considering the motor’s nonlinear and time-varying natures is developed in this study. A recurrent wavelet fuzzy neural network (RWFNN) with intelligent backstepping control is proposed to achieve this. In this study, first, a maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) controlled PMASynRM servo drive is introduced. A lookup table (LUT) is created, which is based on finite element analysis (FEA) results by using ANSYS Maxwell-2D dynamic model to determine the current angle command of the MTPA. Next, a backstepping control (BSC) system is created to accurately follow the desired position in the PMASynRM servo drive system while maintaining robust control characteristics. However, designing an efficient BSC for practical applications becomes challenging due to the lack of prior uncertainty information. To overcome this challenge, this study introduces an RWFNN as an approximation for the BSC, aiming to alleviate the limitations of the traditional BSC approach. An enhanced adaptive compensator is also incorporated into the RWFNN to handle potential approximation errors effectively. In addition, to ensure the stability of the RWFNN, the Lyapunov stability method is employed to develop online learning algorithms for the RWFNN and to guarantee its asymptotic stability. The proposed intelligent backstepping control with recurrent wavelet fuzzy neural network (IBSCRWFNN) demonstrates remarkable effectiveness and robustness in controlling the PMASynRM servo drive, as evidenced by the experimental results.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Drag coefficient<sep>Stall (fluid mechanics)<sep>Vortex shedding<sep>Airfoil<sep>Wing<sep>Wake<sep>Bluff<sep>Focus (optics)<sep>Flow (mathematics)<sep>Leading edge<sep>Square (algebra)<sep>Reynolds number<sep>Trailing edge<sep>Supersonic speed<sep>Cylinder<sep>Compression (physics)<sep>Pitching moment<sep>Channel (broadcasting)<sep>Drag<sep>Mach number<sep>Turbulence<sep>Vortex</keyword><title>A review of experiments on stationary bluff body wakes<sep>Effects of smart flap on aerodynamic performance of sinusoidal leading-edge wings at low Reynolds numbers<sep>Numerical Simulation of a Pitching Airfoil Under Dynamic Stall of Low Reynolds Number Flow<sep>Performance Evaluation of External and Mixed Compression Supersonic Air Intakes: Parametric Study<sep>Suppression of vortex shedding behind a square cylinder confined in a diverging channel</title><abstract>Experimental studies dealing with the wake of isolated stationary bluff bodies are reviewed. After briefly recalling the pioneering works in this domain, the paper focuses on recent research conducted with the latest experimental methods and techniques. The review encompasses a range of topics, including the effects of bluff body geometry (non-circular cross sections and non-uniformity in spanwise direction), steady and unsteady (periodic and non-periodic) inflow conditions, surface proximity (rigid wall, confinement, and water free surface) and non-Newtonian fluids. Focus is brought to the flow physics of the wakes, especially the complex three-dimensional and oscillatory behaviors induced by the periodic vortex shedding phenomenon. The paper aims to offer a critical and systematic review of new knowledge and findings on the subject area, as well as the most frequently adopted experimental techniques. The review also helps identifying knowledge gaps in the literature that need to be addressed in future investigations.<sep>Sinusoidal leading-edge wings have shown a high performance after the stall region. In this study, the role of smart flaps in the aerodynamics of smooth and sinusoidal leading-edge wings at low Reynolds numbers of 29,000, 40,000 and 58,000 is investigated. Four wings with NACA 63 4 -021 profile are firstly designed and then manufactured by a 3 D printer. Beam bending equation is used to determine the smart flap chord deflection. Next, wind tunnel tests are carried out to measure the lift and drag forces of proposed wings for a wide range of angles of attack, from zero to 36 degrees. Results show that using trailing-edge smart flap in sinusoidal leading-edge wing delays the stall point compared to the same wing without flap. However, a combination of smooth leading-edge wing and smart flap advances the stall. Furthermore, it is found that wings with smart flap generally have a higher lift to drag ratio due to their excellent performance in producing lift.<sep>In this research, viscous, unsteady and turbulent fluid flow is simulated numerically around a pitching NACA0012 airfoil in the dynamic stall area. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized based on the finite volume method and are solved by the PIMPLE algorithm in the open source software, namely OpenFOAM. The SST k - ω model is used as the turbulence model for Low Reynolds Number flows in the order of 105. A homogenous dynamic mesh is used to reduce cell skewness of mesh to prevent non-physical oscillations in aerodynamic forces unlike previous studies. In this paper, the effects of Reynolds number, reduced frequency, oscillation amplitude and airfoil thickness on aerodynamic force coefficients and dynamic stall delay are investigated. These parameters have a significant impact on the maximum lift, drag, the ratio of aerodynamic forces and the location of dynamic stall. The most important parameters that affect the maximum lift to drag coefficient ratio and cause dynamic stall delaying are airfoil thickness and reduced frequency, respectively.<sep>This research computationally evaluates the performance variations of two common types of supersonic air intakes, external and mixed compression, due to changes in the geometries of the intakes as well as some flow conditions. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver was developed by the authors and used to simulate the compressible, two-dimensional (2D), and turbulent flow inside and around the supersonic air intakes. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the role of geometric parameters, including spike angle, exit area, overall intake length, and flow parameters, such as the flight Mach number and back pressure ratio (BPR), on the performance of the intakes. Total pressure recovery (TPR), mass flow ratio (MFR), flow distortion (FD), and drag coefficient (CD) were considered as the performance factors of the supersonic intakes. The results indicated that increments of BPR had desirable effects on the performance of the intakes at supercritical conditions, and increments of the free-stream Mach number deteriorated the performance of both intakes. FD was the most sensitive parameter to the geometric variations, while TPR and MFR were almost unchanged. In addition, the superiority of the mixed compression intake was shown in terms of lower drag coefficient and FD in comparison with the external compression intake.<sep>Confinement can be considered as a passive method for controlling the vortex shedding behind bluff bodies. However, this technique is often accompanied with a considerable drag increase as a penalty. This paper is aimed at investigating the effects of divergence ratio (DR) from 0.2 to 1.2 on flow characteristics (instantaneous aerodynamic coefficients, time-mean drag coefficient, Strouhal number and rms value of lift coefficient) and flow topology (vorticity contour and streamlines) around a confined square cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100. Furthermore, the critical Reynolds number where the onset of vortex shedding happens is determined for all diverged channels. The results indicate that vortex shedding is completely suppressed for channels with 0.26 ≤ DR ≤ 0.45. For the channel with DR = 0.26, a drag reduction has been achieved and the drag coefficient of the square cylinder reduces by 18.85% in comparison with that of the unbounded cylinder at Re = 100. Furthermore, the critical Reynolds number which is determined to be 49 for the unconfined square cylinder is delayed to 101 in this channel. It is also found that the drag coefficient, the rms value of lift coefficient and Strouhal number increase with divergence ratio while the vortex formation length and the wake width generally decrease. • The effects of channel divergence ratio (DR) on flow characteristics around a confined square cylinder are investigated. • The vortex shedding is completely suppressed for channels with 0.26 = DR ≤ 0.45. • The drag coefficient of the channel with DR = 0.26 is 18.85% less than the unbounded case at Re = 100. • The drag coefficient, rms value of lift coefficient and Strouhal number generally increase with divergence ratio. • The vortex formation length and the wake width generally decrease with divergence ratio.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/261576/lecturer-engineering-electrical-and-electronic-engineering/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5037761644", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5052111149", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description, particularly in the areas of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, with a focus on motor control systems, sensor networks, and IoT, which are highly relevant to the role.

The complement pathway represents one of the first mechanisms of defense against infection and the complement receptor 3 (CR3), which is highly expressed on macrophages, is a major receptor for many pathogens and debris. Key to dissecting the mechanisms by which CR3‐mediated phagocytosis occurs, is understanding how the complex actin binding protein machinery and associated regulators interact with actin during phagocytosis, from triggering of receptor, through to phagosome formation and closure. Results Here, we reveal that Dynamin‐2 is recruited concomitantly with polymerized actin at the phagocytic cup and during phagosome formation and closure. Inhibition of Dynamin activity leads to stalled phagocytic cups and a decrease in the amount of F‐actin at the site of phagocytosis. Conclusions Dynamin‐2 regulates the assembly of the F‐actin phagocytic cup for successful CR3‐mediated phagocytosis. Significance These results highlight an important role for Dynamin‐2 in actin remodeling downstream of integrins.<sep>In higher organisms, the professional phagocytes of the immune system (dendritic cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) are responsible for pathogen clearance, the development of immune responses via cytokine secretion and presentation of antigens derived from internalized material, and the normal turnover and remodelling of tissues and disposal of dead cells. These functions rely on the ability of phagocytes to migrate and adhere to sites of infection, dynamically probe their environments to make contact with phagocytic targets, and perform phagocytosis, a mechanism of internalization of large particles, microorganisms, and cellular debris for intracellular degradation. The cell-generated forces that are necessary for the professional phagocytes to act in their roles as ‘first responders’ of the immune system have been the subject of mechanical studies in recent years. Methods of force measurement such as atomic force microscopy, traction force microscopy, micropipette aspiration, magnetic and optical tweezers, and exciting new variants of these have accompanied classical biological methods to perform mechanical investigations of these highly dynamic immune cells.<sep>Human rhinovirus is a causative agent of severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is characterised by an increased number of alveolar macrophages with diminished phagocytic functions, but how rhinovirus infection affects macrophage function is still unknown. Here, we describe that human rhinovirus 16 impairs bacterial uptake and receptor-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages. The stalled phagocytic cups contain accumulated F-actin. Interestingly, we find that human rhinovirus 16 downregulates the expression of Arpin, a negative regulator of the Arp2/3 complex. Importantly, re-expression of the protein rescues defective internalisation in human rhinovirus 16-treated cells, demonstrating that Arpin is a key factor targeted to impair phagocytosis. We further show that Arpin is required for efficient uptake of multiple targets, for F-actin cup formation and for successful phagosome completion in macrophages. Interestingly, Arpin is recruited to sites of membrane extension and phagosome closure. Thus, we identify Arpin as a central actin regulator during phagocytosis that it is targeted by human rhinovirus 16, allowing the virus to perturb bacterial internalisation and phagocytosis in macrophages.<sep>The annexins are a family of C a 2 + -dependent peripheral membrane proteins. Several annexins are implicated in plasma membrane repair and are overexpressed in cancer cells. Annexin A4 (ANXA4) and annexin A5 (ANXA5) form trimers that induce high curvature on a membrane surface, a phenomenon deemed to accelerate membrane repair. Despite being highly homologous to ANXA4, annexin A3 (ANXA3) does not form trimers on the membrane surface. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have reverse engineered an ANXA3-mutant to trimerize on the surface of the membrane and induce high curvature reminiscent of ANXA4. In addition, atomic force microscopy images show that, like ANXA4, the engineered protein forms crystalline arrays on a supported lipid membrane. Despite the trimer-forming and curvature-inducing properties of the engineered ANXA3, it does not accumulate near a membrane lesion in laser-punctured cells and is unable to repair the lesion. Our investigation provides insights into the factors that drive annexin-mediated membrane repair and shows that the membrane-repairing property of trimer-forming annexins also necessitates high membrane binding affinity, other than trimer formation and induction of negative membrane curvature.<sep>The plasma membrane surrounds every single cell and essentially shapes cell life by separating the interior from the external environment. Thus, maintenance of cell membrane integrity is essential to prevent death caused by disruption of the plasma membrane. To counteract plasma membrane injuries, eukaryotic cells have developed efficient repair tools that depend on Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding annexin proteins. Upon membrane damage, annexin family members are activated by a Ca2+ influx, enabling them to quickly bind at the damaged membrane and facilitate wound healing. Our recent studies, based on interdisciplinary research synergy across molecular cell biology, experimental membrane physics, and computational simulations show that annexins have additional biophysical functions in the repair response besides enabling membrane fusion. Annexins possess different membrane-shaping properties, allowing for a tailored response that involves rapid bending, constriction, and fusion of membrane edges for resealing. Moreover, some annexins have high affinity for highly curved membranes that appear at free edges near rupture sites, a property that might accelerate their recruitment for rapid repair. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of annexin-mediated membrane shaping and curvature sensing in the light of our interdisciplinary approach to study plasma membrane repair.<sep>Abstract Phagocytosis is the mechanism of the internalization of large particles, microorganisms and cellular debris. The complement pathway represents one of the first mechanisms of defense against infection and the complement receptor 3 (CR3), which is highly expressed on macrophages, is a major receptor for many pathogens and debris. Key to dissecting the mechanisms by which CR3-mediated phagocytosis occurs, is understanding how the complex actin binding protein machinery and associated regulators interact with actin during phagocytosis, from triggering of receptor, through to phagosome formation and closure. However, how CR3-mediated phagosome completion and closure are orchestrated is not known. Here, we reveal that dynamin-2 is recruited concomitantly with polymerised actin at the site of the nascent phagosomes and accumulates until membrane scission. Inhibition of dynamin activity leads to stalled phagocytic cups and a decrease in the amount of F-actin at the site of phagocytosis. Acute inhibition of dynamin activity in living phagocytosing cells established that dynamin-2 plays a critical role in the effective scission of the CR3-phagosome from the plasma membrane. Thus, dynamin-2 has two distinct roles in CR3-mediated phagocytosis, in the assembly of the F-actin phagocytic cup and during phagosome scission.<sep>Repair of damaged plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells is largely dependent on the binding of annexin repair proteins to phospholipids. Changing the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane may provide means to compromise annexin-mediated repair and sensitize cells to injury. Since, cancer cells experience heightened membrane stress and are more dependent on efficient plasma membrane repair, inhibiting repair may provide approaches to sensitize cancer cells to plasma membrane damage and cell death. Here, we show that derivatives of phenothiazines, which have widespread use in the fields of psychiatry and allergy treatment, strongly sensitize cancer cells to mechanical-, chemical-, and heat-induced injury by inhibiting annexin-mediated plasma membrane repair. Using a combination of cell biology, biophysics, and computer simulations, we show that trifluoperazine acts by thinning the membrane bilayer, making it more fragile and prone to ruptures. Secondly, it decreases annexin binding by compromising the lateral diffusion of phosphatidylserine, inhibiting the ability of annexins to curve and shape membranes, which is essential for their function in plasma membrane repair. Our results reveal a novel avenue to target cancer cells by compromising plasma membrane repair in combination with noninvasive approaches that induce membrane injuries.<sep>Self-association of cholesterol into aggregates and crystals is a hallmark of developing atherosclerosis. Intrinsically fluorescent sterols, such as dehydroergosterol (DHE), can be used to study sterol aggregation by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy, but a thorough understanding of DHE’s photophysical and structural properties in the aggregated state is missing. Here, we show that DHE forms submicron fluorescent aggregates when evaporated from an ethanol solution. Using atomic force microscopy, we find that DHE, like cholesterol, forms compact oblate-shape aggregates of <100 nm in diameter. DHE’s fluorescence is lowered in the aggregate compared to the monomeric form, and characteristic spectral changes accompany the aggregation process. Electronic structure calculations of DHE dimers in water indicate that Frenkel-type exciton coupling contributes to the lowered DHE fluorescence in the aggregates. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that DHE forms compact aggregates on the nanosecond scale and with strong intermolecular attraction, in which a broad range of orientations, and therefore electronic couplings, will take place. Tight packing of DHE in aggregates also lowers the apparent absorption cross section, further reducing the molecular brightness of the aggregates. Our results pave the way for systematic solubility studies of intrinsically fluorescent analogues of biologically relevant sterols.<sep>Alveolar macrophages (AM) are crucial to COPD pathogenesis. Evidence suggests they have defective internalisation mechanisms which could drive disease exacerbations where human rhinovirus (HRV) is isolated. We hypothesised HRV infection of macrophages could impair their internalisation functions. AM or monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) were challenged with HRV16 and then with various triggers and internalisation assessed. Changes to the actin cytoskeleton following HRV16 infection and following particle internalisation were assessed by microscopy. AM or MDM challenged with HRV16 demonstrated deficient internalisation towards multiple triggers. HRV16 exaggerated deficient internalisation in COPD AM. HRV16 altered the actin cytoskeleton in macrophages driving persistence of actin around internalised particles. Screening for actin regulators affected by HRV16 identified Arpin, a negative Arp2/3 regulator to be significantly decreased after infection. Re-expression of Arpin after infection restored internalisation defects. Further, Arpin depletion impaired internalisation in a similar manner as HRV16 with internalisation stalling at the same point with significantly reduced bacterial uptake. These results confirm that HRV16 targets Arpin in macrophages to impair particle internalisation. Our results demonstrate HRV16 impairs various macrophage internalisation pathways by targeting Arpin. Hence, HRV16 can hijack macrophage functions and an important phagocytic regulator possibly explaining why COPD patients show secondary bacterial infection post virus infection with increased bacterial numbers.<sep>The integrity of the plasma membrane is essential for maintaining cell homeostasis and eucaryotic cells have developed robust mechanisms for rapidly sealing plasma membrane ruptures. The repair process involves recruitment of multiple proteins to the damage site as triggered by the influx of calcium ions from the cytosol. Several members of the Annexin family are involved in membrane repair although their functional role in membrane remodeling is not fully understood. Biophysical experiments and modeling in synergy with cell experiments offer tools which can provide additional insight into Annexin mediated repair mechanisms. We review our recent studies into membrane remodeling and protein structures induced by Annexin binding. Using a unique platform of planar, free-edged membrane patches, the edge region of a membrane hole can be experimentally mimicked under controlled conditions. Using this platform, Annexins induce spontaneous membrane curvature leading to distinct, curved morphologies. We discuss the theoretical modeling of curvature effects and the formation of membrane necks around holes. We also describe AFM results resolving the organization of Annexins on membranes with molecular detail. Finally, we describe quantification of the calcium influx in cells during subjected to laser rupture. Detailed analysis and modeling of calcium diffusion and pumping allows extraction of key parameters for repair such as the timescale of hole closure.<sep>Annexin A4 and A5 (ANXA4, ANXA5), both shown to be required for efficient plasma membrane repair (PMR) in living cells, bind as trimers to anionic membranes in the presence of calcium. Both annexins induce membrane curvature and self-assemble into crystal arrays on membranes, observations that have been associated with PMR. However, in-vitro studies of annexins have traditionally been performed using single annexins, despite the recruitment of multiple annexins to the damage site in cells. Hence, we study the potential cooperativity of ANXA4 and ANXA5 during membrane binding. Laser injury experiments were performed on MCF7 cells transfected to transiently express labelled ANXA4 and ANXA5 to study the localization of the proteins at the damage site. Using free-edged DOPC/DOPS (9:1) membranes we investigated the annexin-induced membrane rolling by fluorescence microscopy and the lateral arrangement of annexin trimers on the membrane surface by atomic force microscopy (AFM). ANXA4 and ANXA5 colocalise at the damage site of MCF7 cells during repair. A (1:1) mixture of ANXA4 and ANXA5 induces membrane rolling with a time constant intermediate between the value for the pure annexins. While binding of the pure annexins creates crystal lattices, the (1:1) mixture generates a random arrangement of trimers. Thus, curvature induction remains as a functional property of annexin mixtures in PMR rather than crystal formation.<sep>Rapid membrane repair is required to ensure cell survival after rupture of the plasma membrane. The annexin family of proteins is involved in plasma membrane repair (PMR) and is activated by the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium at the site of injury. Annexins A1 and A2 (ANXA1 and ANXA2, respectively) are structurally similar and bind to negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) to induce membrane cross-linking and to promote fusion, which are both essential processes that occur during membrane repair. The degree of annexin accumulation and the annexin mobility at cross-linked membranes are important aspects of ANXA1 and ANXA2 function in repair. Here, we quantify ANXA1- and ANXA2-induced membrane cross-linking between giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Time-lapse measurements show that ANXA1 and ANXA2 can induce membrane cross-linking on a time scale compatible with PMR. Cross-linked membrane–membrane interfaces between the GUVs persist in time without fusion, and quantification of confocal microscopy images demonstrates that ANXA1, ANXA2, and, to a lesser extent, PS lipids accumulate at the double membrane interface. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching shows that the annexins are fully immobilized at the double membrane interface, whereas PS lipids display a 75% decrease in mobility. In addition, the complete immobilization of annexins between two membranes indicates a high degree of network formation between annexins, suggesting that membrane cross-linking is mainly driven by protein–protein interactions.<sep>The cell nucleus protects the cellular genome and is the site of DNA repair and of replication during cell division. The nucleus is also a highly deformable mechanical object subject to various forces applied by the cytoskeleton and neighbouring cells, particularly in cells of tissue exposed to mechanical stress. The mechanical properties of cancer cell nuclei are a key aspect of the cells which can be linked to their invasive ability. Thus, a detailed mechanical characterization of cell nuclei and of their “mechanical fingerprint” is highly important as an indicator of cellular robustness and pathogenicity. In typical mechanical experiments on cell nuclei, isolated nuclei are used instead of live cell nuclei. However, it is not clear whether isolated nuclei are an appropriate model for live cell nuclei since the isolation process could potentially induce changes in the mechanically dominant nuclear structures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based microrheology is a powerful biophysical tool for measuring nuclear mechanics and can performed both in an active and passive rheology mode. Here we systematically perform microrheological characterization of isolated and live cell nuclei obtained from the same breast cancer cell type. Viscous and elastic moduli of nuclei are measured and the results are modelled with viscoelastic spring-dashpot models. Our data indicate that isolated and live cell nuclei are mechanically similar and can be described by the four-parameter Burgers model.<sep>Despite the importance of encapsulation in bacterial pathogenesis, the biochemical mechanisms and forces that underpin retention of capsule by encapsulated bacteria are poorly understood. In Gram-negative bacteria, there may be interactions between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core and capsule polymers, between capsule polymers with retained acyl carriers and the outer membrane, and in some bacteria, between the capsule polymers and Wzi, an outer membrane protein lectin. Our transposon studies in Klebsiella pneumoniae B5055 identified additional genes that, when insertionally inactivated, resulted in reduced encapsulation. Inactivation of the gene waaL, which encodes the ligase responsible for attaching the repeated O antigen of LPS to the LPS core, resulted in a significant reduction in capsule retention, measured by atomic force microscopy. This reduction in encapsulation was associated with increased sensitivity to human serum and decreased virulence in a murine model of respiratory infection and, paradoxically, with increased biofilm formation. The capsule in the WaaL mutant was physically smaller than that of the Wzi mutant of K. pneumoniae B5055. These results suggest that interactions between surface carbohydrate polymers may enhance encapsulation, a key phenotype in bacterial virulence, and provide another target for the development of antimicrobials that may avoid resistance issues associated with growth inhibition. IMPORTANCE Bacterial capsules, typically comprised of complex sugars, enable pathogens to avoid key host responses to infection, including phagocytosis. These capsules are synthesized within the bacteria, exported through the outer envelope, and then secured to the external surface of the organism by a force or forces that are incompletely described. This study shows that in the important hospital pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, the polysaccharide capsule is retained by interactions with other surface sugars, especially the repeated sugar molecule of the LPS molecule in Gram-negative bacteria known as \"O antigen.\" This O antigen is joined to the LPS molecule by ligation, and loss of the enzyme responsible for ligation, a protein called WaaL, results in reduced encapsulation. Since capsules are essential to the virulence of many pathogens, WaaL might provide a target for new antimicrobial development, critical to the control of pathogens like K. pneumoniae that have become highly drug resistant.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>XANES<sep>Operator (biology)<sep>Intramolecular force<sep>Amplitude<sep>Ion<sep>Hydrogen bond<sep>Scattering<sep>Atom (system on chip)<sep>Ionization<sep>Projection (relational algebra)<sep>Absorption spectroscopy<sep>Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering<sep>Spin (aerodynamics)<sep>Allene<sep>Photon<sep>Focus (optics)<sep>Picosecond<sep>Relaxation (psychology)<sep>Molecular dynamics<sep>Core (optical fiber)<sep>Wave function<sep>Software<sep>Symmetry (geometry)<sep>Spectral line<sep>Absorption (acoustics)<sep>BODIPY<sep>Potential energy surface<sep>Multipole expansion<sep>X-ray absorption spectroscopy<sep>Internal conversion<sep>Symmetry breaking<sep>Conical intersection<sep>Laser<sep>Density functional theory<sep>Point reflection<sep>Synchrotron radiation<sep>Molecule<sep>Electronic structure<sep>Space (punctuation)<sep>Excited state<sep>Valence (chemistry)<sep>Dipole<sep>Electron<sep>Protonation<sep>Radiative transfer<sep>Cationic polymerization<sep>Core electron<sep>Methylation<sep>Coupling (piping)</keyword><title>Breaking inversion symmetry by protonation: experimental and theoretical NEXAFS study of the diazynium ion, N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup><sep>X-ray absorption of molecular cations—a new challenge for electronic structure theory<sep>X-Ray Absorption Spectrum of the <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">N</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math> Molecular Ion<sep>The OpenMolcas <i>Web</i>: A Community-Driven Approach to Advancing Computational Chemistry<sep>The OpenMolcas Web: A Community-Driven Approach to Advancing Computational Chemistry<sep>Experimental and theoretical near-edge x-ray-absorption fine-structure studies of <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>NO</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math><sep>Symmetry breaking in core-valence double ionisation of allene<sep>The carbon and oxygen K-edge NEXAFS spectra of CO<sup>+</sup><sep>Probing hydrogen bond strength in liquid water by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering<sep>Formation and relaxation of K−2 and K−2V double-core-hole states in <i>n</i>-butane<sep>Efficient calculations of a large number of highly excited states for multiconfigurational wavefunctions<sep>Exact semi-classical light–matter interaction operator applied to two-photon processes with strong relativistic effects<sep>Suppressing non-radiative decay of photochromic organic molecular systems in the strong coupling regime<sep>Nuclear dynamics in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption of methanol<sep>Deciphering methylation effects on S2(pp*) internal conversion in the simplest linear alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl<sep>Deciphering Methylation Effects on S<sub>2</sub>(<i>ππ</i>*) Internal Conversion in the Simplest Linear α,β-Unsaturated Carbonyl</title><abstract>As an example of symmetry breaking in NEXAFS spectra of protonated species we present a high resolution NEXAFS spectrum of protonated dinitrogen, the diazynium ion N 2 H + .<sep>In this paper we put forward some historical notes on the development of computational chemistry toward applications of x-ray spectroscopies. We highlight some of the important contributions by Enrico Clementi as method and program developer and as a supporter of this branch of computational research. We bring up a modern example based on the very recent experimental development of x-ray absorption of cationic molecules. As we show this spectroscopy poses new challenges for electronic structure theory and the electron correlation problem.<sep>The x-ray absorption spectrum of N_{2}^{+} in the K-edge region has been measured by irradiation of ions stored in a cryogenic radio frequency ion trap with synchrotron radiation. We interpret the experimental results with the help of restricted active space multiconfiguration theory. Spectroscopic constants of the 1σ_{u}^{-1} ^{2}Σ_{u}^{+} state, and the two 1σ_{u}^{-1}3σ_{g}^{-1}1π_{g} ^{2}Π_{u} states are determined from the measurements. The charge of the ground state together with spin coupling involving several open shells give rise to double excitations and configuration mixing, and a complete breakdown of the orbital picture for higher lying core-excited states.<sep>The developments of the open-source OpenMolcas chemistry software environment since spring 2020 are described, with a focus on novel functionalities accessible in the stable branch of the package or via interfaces with other packages.

While neutral NO has an open shell, the cation is a closed-shell species, which for NEXAFS leads to the simplicity of a closed-shell spectrum. Compared to neutral NO, the electrons in the cation experience a stronger Coulomb potential, which introduces a shift of the ionization potential towards higher energies, a depletion of intensity in a large interval above the ${\\ensuremath{\\pi}}^{*}$ resonance, and a shift of the ${\\ensuremath{\\sigma}}^{*}$ resonance from the continuum to below the ionization threshold. NEXAFS features at the nitrogen and oxygen $K$ edges of ${\\mathrm{NO}}^{+}$ are compared, as well as NEXAFS features at the nitrogen edges of the isoelectronic closed-shell species ${\\mathrm{NO}}^{+}, {\\mathrm{N}}_{2}$, and ${\\mathrm{N}}_{2}{\\mathrm{H}}^{+}$.<sep>Conventional electron spectroscopy is an established one-electron-at-the-time method for revealing the electronic structure and dynamics of either valence or inner shell ionized systems. By combining an electron-electron coincidence technique with the use of soft X-radiation we have measured a double ionisation spectrum of the allene molecule in which one electron is removed from a C1s core orbital and one from a valence orbital, well beyond Siegbahns Electron-Spectroscopy-for-Chemical-Analysis method. This core-valence double ionisation spectrum shows the effect of symmetry breaking in an extraordinary way, when the core electron is ejected from one of the two outer carbon atoms. To explain the spectrum we present a new theoretical approach combining the benefits of a full self-consistent field approach with those of perturbation methods and multi-configurational techniques, thus establishing a powerful tool to reveal molecular orbital symmetry breaking on such an organic molecule, going beyond Löwdins standard definition of electron correlation.<sep>We present and analyze high resolution near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra of CO+ at the carbon and oxygen K-edges. The spectra show a wealth of features that appear very differently at the two K-edges. The analysis of these features can be divided into three parts; (i) repopulation transition to the open shell orbital - here the C(1s) or O(1s) to 5σ transition, where the normal core hole state is reached from a different initial state and different interaction than in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; (ii) spin coupled split valence bands corresponding to C(1s) or O(1s) to π* transitions; (iii) remainder weak and long progressions towards the double ionization potentials containing a manifold of peaks. These parts, none of which has correspondence in NEXAFS spectra of neutral molecules, are dictated by the localization of the singly occupied 5σ orbital, adding a dimension of chemistry to the ionic NEXAFS technique.<sep>Abstract Local probes of the electronic ground state are essential for understanding hydrogen bonding in aqueous environments. When tuned to the dissociative core-excited state at the O1 s pre-edge of water, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering back to the electronic ground state exhibits a long vibrational progression due to ultrafast nuclear dynamics. We show how the coherent evolution of the OH bonds around the core-excited oxygen provides access to high vibrational levels in liquid water. The OH bonds stretch into the long-range part of the potential energy curve, which makes the X-ray probe more sensitive than infra-red spectroscopy to the local environment. We exploit this property to effectively probe hydrogen bond strength via the distribution of intramolecular OH potentials derived from measurements. In contrast, the dynamical splitting in the spectral feature of the lowest valence-excited state arises from the short-range part of the OH potential curve and is rather insensitive to hydrogen bonding.<sep>Using a magnetic bottle multi-electron time-of-flight spectrometer in combination with synchrotron radiation, double-core-hole pre-edge and continuum states involving the K-shell of the carbon atoms in n-butane (n-C4H10) have been identified, where the ejected core electron(s) and the emitted Auger electrons from the decay of such states have been detected in coincidence. An assignment of the main observed spectral features is based on the results of multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculations for the excitation energies and static exchange (STEX) calculations for energies and intensities. MCSCF results have been analyzed in terms of static and dynamic electron relaxation as well as electron correlation contributions to double-core-hole state ionization potentials. The analysis of applicability of the STEX method, which implements the one-particle picture toward the complete basis set limit, is motivated by the fact that it scales well toward large species. We find that combining the MCSCF and STEX techniques is a viable approach to analyze double-core-hole spectra.<sep>Electronically excited states play important roles in many chemical reactions and spectroscopic techniques. In quantum chemistry, a common technique to solve excited states is the multiroot Davidson algorithm, but it is not designed for processes like X-ray spectroscopy that involves hundreds of highly excited states. We show how the use of a restricted active space wavefunction together with a projection operator to remove low-lying electronic states offers an efficient way to reach single and double-core-hole states. Additionally, several improvements to the stability and efficiency of the configuration interaction (CI) algorithm for a large number of states are suggested. When applied to a series of transition metal complexes the new CI algorithm does not only resolve divergence issues but also leads to typical reduction in computational time by 70%, with the largest savings for small molecules and large active spaces. Together, the projection operator and the improved CI algorithm now make it possible to simulate a wide range of single- and two-photon spectroscopies. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<sep>X-ray processes involve interactions with high-energy photons. For these short wavelengths, the perturbing field cannot be treated as constant, and there is a need to go beyond the electric-dipole approximation. The exact semi-classical light-matter interaction operator offers several advantages compared to the multipole expansion such as improved stability and ease of implementation. Here, the exact operator is used to model x-ray scattering in metal K pre-edges. This is a relativistic two-photon process where absorption is dominated by electric-dipole forbidden transitions. With the restricted active space state-interaction approach, spectra can be calculated even for the multiconfigurational wavefunctions including second-order perturbation. However, as the operator itself depends on the transition energy, the cost for evaluating integrals for hundreds of thousands unique transitions becomes a bottleneck. Here, this is solved by calculating the integrals in a molecular-orbital basis that only runs over the active space, combined with a grouping scheme where the operator is the same for close-lying transitions. This speeds up the calculations of single-photon processes and is critical for the modeling of two-photon scattering processes. The new scheme is used to model Kα resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of iron-porphyrin complexes with relevance to studies of heme enzymes, for which the total computational time is reduced by several orders of magnitude with an effect on transition intensities of 0.1% or less.<sep>The lifetimes of electronic excited states have a strong influence on the efficiency of organic solar cells. However, in some molecular systems a given excited state lifetime is reduced due to the non-radiative decay through conical intersections. Several strategies may be used to suppress this decay channel. The use of the strong light-matter coupling provided in optical nano-cavities is the focus of this paper. Here, we consider the meso-tert-butyl-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene molecule (meso-tert-butyl-BODIPY) as a showcase of how strong and ultrastrong coupling might help in the development of organic solar cells. The meso-tert-butyl-BODIPY is known for its low fluorescence yield caused by the non-radiative decay through a conical intersection. However, we show here that, by considering this system within a cavity, the strong coupling can lead to significant changes in the multidimensional landscape of the potential energy surfaces of meso-tert-butyl-BODIPY, suppressing almost completely the decay of the excited state wave packet back to the ground state. By means of multi configuration electronic structure calculations and nuclear wave packet dynamics, the coupling with the cavity is analyzed in-depth to provide further insight of the interaction. By fine-tuning the cavity field strength and resonance frequency, we show that one can change the nuclear dynamics in the excited state, and control the non-radiative decay. This may lead to a faster and more efficient population transfer or the suppression of it.<sep>We report on a combined theoretical and experimental study of core-excitation spectra of gas and liquid phase methanol as obtained with the use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). The electronic transitions are studied with computational methods that include strict and extended second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction [ADC(2) and ADC(2)-x], restricted active space second-order perturbation theory, and time-dependent density functional theory—providing a complete assignment of the near oxygen K-edge XAS. We show that multimode nuclear dynamics is of crucial importance for explaining the available experimental XAS and RIXS spectra. The multimode nuclear motion was considered in a recently developed “mixed representation” where dissociative states and highly excited vibrational modes are accurately treated with a time-dependent wave packet technique, while the remaining active vibrational modes are described using Franck–Condon amplitudes. Particular attention is paid to the polarization dependence of RIXS and the effects of the isotopic substitution on the RIXS profile in the case of dissociative core-excited states. Our approach predicts the splitting of the 2a″ RIXS peak to be due to an interplay between molecular and pseudo-atomic features arising in the course of transitions between dissociative core- and valence-excited states. The dynamical nature of the splitting of the 2a″ peak in RIXS of liquid methanol near pre-edge core excitation is shown. The theoretical results are in good agreement with our liquid phase measurements and gas phase experimental data available from the literature.<sep>Chemical substituents can influence photodynamics by altering the location of critical points and topography of the potential energy surface (electronic effect) and by selectively altering the inertia of specific nuclear modes (inertial effects). Using non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, we investigate the impact of methylation on S2(pp*) internal conversion in acrolein – the simplest linear alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Consistent with time constants reported in a previous time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy study, S2/S1-deactivation occurs on an ultrafast timescale (~50 fs). However, our simulations do not corroborate the sequential decay model used to fit the experiment. Instead, upon reaching the S1 state, the wavepacket bifurcates: a portion undergoes ballistic S1/S0-deactivation (~80 fs) mediated by fast bond-length alternation motion, while the remaining decays on the ps-timescale in a more statistical regime. Our analysis reveals that methyl substitution, generally assumed to mainly exert inertial influence, also manifests in important electronic effects due to its weak electron-donating ability. While methylation at the beta C-atom gives rise to effects principally of inertial nature, such as retarding the twisting motion of the terminal -CHCH3 group and increasing its coupling with pyramidalization, methylation at the alpha or carbonyl C-atom modifies the potential energy surfaces in a way that also contributes to alterating the late S1-decay behavior. Specifically, our results suggest that the factor-of-two slowing of the ps-component upon alpha-methylation is a consequence of a tighter surface and reduced amplitude along the central pyramidalization, effectively restricting the access to the S1/S0-intersection seam. Our work offers new insight into the S2(pp*) internal conversion mechanisms in acrolein and its methylated derivatives and highlights site-selective methylation as a tuning knob to manipulate photochemical reactions.<sep>Chemical substituents can influence photodynamics by altering the location of critical points and the topography of the potential energy surfaces (electronic effect) and by selectively modifying the inertia of specific nuclear modes (inertial effects). Using nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, we investigate the impact of methylation on S2(ππ*) internal conversion in acrolein, the simplest linear α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. Consistent with time constants reported in a previous time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy study, S2 → S1 deactivation occurs on an ultrafast time scale (∼50 fs). However, our simulations do not corroborate the sequential decay model used to fit the experiment.

The role of OCT1 in vivo has not been confirmed, however, via drug–drug interactions that similarly affect exposure. In the current research, we used Oct1/2 knockout mice to assess the role of Oct1 in hepatic clearance and liver partitioning of clinical substrates and assess the model for predicting an effect of OCT1 function on pharmacokinetics in humans. Four OCT1 substrates (sumatriptan, fenoterol, ondansetron, and tropisetron) were administered to wild-type and knockout mice, and plasma, tissue, and urine were collected. Tissue transporter expression was evaluated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In vitro, uptake of all compounds in human and mouse hepatocytes and human OCT1- and OCT2-expressing cells was evaluated. The largest effect of knockout was on hepatic clearance and liver partitioning of sumatriptan (2- to 5-fold change), followed by fenoterol, whereas minimal changes in the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron and tropisetron were observed. This aligned with uptake in mouse hepatocytes, in which inhibition of uptake of sumatriptan and fenoterol into mouse hepatocytes by an OCT1 inhibitor was much greater compared with ondansetron and tropisetron. Conversely, inhibition of all four substrates was evident in human hepatocytes, in line with reported clinical pharmacogenetic data. These data confirm the role of Oct1 in the hepatic uptake of the four OCT1 substrates and elucidate species differences in OCT1-mediated hepatocyte uptake that should be considered when utilizing the model to predict effects in humans. <h3>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</h3> Studies in carriers of <i>SLC22A1</i> null variants indicate a role of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) in the hepatic uptake of therapeutic agents, although OCT1-mediated drug–drug interactions have not been reported. This work used Oct1/2 knockout mice to confirm the role of Oct1 in the hepatic clearance and liver partitioning in mice for OCT1 substrates with reported pharmacogenetic effects. Species differences observed in mouse and human hepatocyte uptake clarify limitations of the knockout model for predicting exposure changes in humans for some OCT1 substrates.<sep>The role of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) in humans is gaining attention as data emerges regarding its role in physiology, drug exposure, and drug response. OCT1 variants with decreased in vitro function correlate well with altered exposure of multiple OCT1 substrates in variant carriers. In the current research, we investigate mechanisms behind activity of OCT1 variants in vitro by generating cell lines expressing known OCT1 variants and quantifying membrane OCT1 protein expression with corresponding OCT1 activity and kinetics. Oct knockout mice have provided additional insight into the role of Oct1 in the liver and have reproduced effects of altered OCT1 activity observed in the clinic. To assess the complex effect of Oct1 depletion on pharmacokinetics of prodrug proguanil and its active moiety cycloguanil, both of which are OCT1 substrates, Oct1/2 −/− mice were used. Decreased membrane expression of OCT1 was demonstrated for all variant cell lines, although activity was substrate-dependent, as reported previously. Lack of change in activity for OCT1*2 resulted in increased intrinsic activity per pmol of OCT1 protein, particularly for sumatriptan but also for proguanil and cycloguanil. Similar to that reported in humans with decreased OCT1 function, systemic exposure of proguanil was minimally affected in Oct1/2 −/− mice. However, proguanil liver partitioning and exposure decreased. Cycloguanil exposure decreased following proguanil administration in Oct1/2 −/− mice, as did the systemic metabolite:parent ratio. When administered directly, systemic exposure of cycloguanil decreased slightly; however liver partitioning and exposure were decreased in Oct1/2 −/− mice. Unexpectedly, following proguanil administration, the metabolite ratio in the liver changed only minimally, and liver partitioning of cycloguanil was affected in Oct1/2 −/− mice to a lesser extent following proguanil administration than direct administration of cycloguanil. In conclusion, these in vitro and in vivo data offer additional complexity in understanding mechanisms of OCT1 variant activity as well as the effects of these variants in vivo . From cell lines, it is apparent that intrinsic activity is not directly related to OCT1 membrane expression. Additionally, in situations with a more complicated role of OCT1 in drug pharmacokinetics there is difficulty translating in vivo impact simply from intrinsic activity from cellular data.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Homeostasis<sep>Lung<sep>DMT1<sep>Endocytic cycle<sep>Choroid plexus<sep>Inflammation<sep>Transferrin receptor<sep>Endocytosis<sep>Erythropoiesis<sep>Heme<sep>Divalent<sep>Manganese<sep>Kidney<sep>Iron homeostasis</keyword><title>A mouse model characterizes the roles of ZIP8 in systemic iron recycling and lung inflammation and infection<sep>Metal-ion transporter SLC39A8 is required for brain manganese uptake and accumulation<sep>Genetic screens reveal CCDC115 as a modulator of erythroid iron and heme trafficking</title><abstract>ZIP8 (SLC39A8) is a transmembrane divalent metal ion importer that is most highly expressed in the lung and is inducible by inflammatory stimuli. In addition to zinc and manganese, ZIP8 can transport iron, but its specific roles in iron regulation during homeostatic and pathologic processes remain poorly understood. Using a novel global inducible ZIP8 knockout (KO) mouse, we analyzed the role of ZIP8 in steady-state iron homeostasis and during inflammation and infection. We observed an unexpected phenotype of elevated spleen iron levels and decreased serum iron in ZIP8 KO mice, suggesting that ZIP8 plays a role in iron recycling. We also showed that ZIP8 is expressed on lung distal airspace epithelial cells and transports iron from the airway into lung tissue. LPS-induced inflammation induced ZIP8 expression in the lung, but ZIP8 deletion had no detrimental effect on the severity of LPS-induced acute lung injury or on the outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection. Thus, ZIP8 plays a role in systemic iron homeostasis but does not modulate the severity of inflammatory lung injury or the host defense against a common bacterial cause of pneumonia.<sep>Manganese (Mn) is an essential nutrient, but is toxic in excess. Whole-body Mn levels are regulated in part by the metal-ion influx transporter SLC39A8, which plays an essential role in the liver by reclaiming Mn from bile. Physiological roles of SLC39A8 in Mn homeostasis in other tissues, however, remain largely unknown. To screen for extrahepatic requirements for SLC39A8 in tissue Mn homeostasis, we crossed Slc39a8-inducible global-KO (Slc39a8 iKO) mice with Slc39a14 KO mice, which display markedly elevated blood and tissue Mn levels. Tissues were then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to determine levels of Mn. Although Slc39a14 KO; Slc39a8 iKO mice exhibited systemic hypermanganesemia and increased Mn loading in the bone and kidney due to Slc39a14 deficiency, we show Mn loading was markedly decreased in the brains of these animals, suggesting a role for SLC39A8 in brain Mn accumulation. Levels of other divalent metals in the brain were unaffected, indicating a specific effect of SLC39A8 on Mn. In vivo radiotracer studies using 54Mn in Slc39a8 iKO mice revealed that SLC39A8 is required for Mn uptake by the brain, but not most other tissues. Furthermore, decreased 54Mn uptake in the brains of Slc39a8 iKO mice was associated with efficient inactivation of Slc39a8 in isolated brain microvessels but not in isolated choroid plexus, suggesting SLC39A8 mediates brain Mn uptake via the blood-brain barrier. These findings establish SLC39A8 as a candidate therapeutic target for mitigating Mn uptake and accumulation in the brain, the primary organ of Mn toxicity.<sep>Abstract Transferrin‐bound iron (TBI), the physiological circulating iron form, is acquired by cells through the transferrin receptor (TfR1) by endocytosis. In erythroid cells, most of the acquired iron is incorporated into heme in the mitochondria. Cellular trafficking of heme is indispensable for erythropoiesis and many other essential biological processes. Comprehensive elucidation of molecular pathways governing and regulating cellular iron acquisition and heme trafficking is required to better understand physiological and pathological processes affecting erythropoiesis. Here, we report the first genome‐wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens in human erythroid cells to identify determinants of iron and heme uptake, as well as heme‐mediated erythroid differentiation. We identified several candidate modulators of TBI acquisition including TfR1, indicating that our approach effectively revealed players mechanistically relevant to the process. Interestingly, components of the endocytic pathway were also revealed as potential determinants of transferrin acquisition. We deciphered a role for the vacuolar‐type H+ − ATPase (V‐ ATPase) assembly factor coiled‐coil domain containing 115 (CCDC115) in TBI uptake and validated this role in CCDC115 deficient K562 cells. Our screen in hemin‐treated cells revealed perturbations leading to cellular adaptation to heme, including those corresponding to trafficking mechanisms and transcription factors potentiating erythroid differentiation. Pathway analysis indicated that endocytosis and vesicle acidification are key processes for heme trafficking in erythroid precursors. Furthermore, we provided evidence that CCDC115, which we identified as required for TBI uptake, is also involved in cellular heme distribution. This work demonstrates a previously unappreciated common intersection in trafficking of transferrin iron and heme in the endocytic pathway of erythroid cells.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/536626", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5025369433", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5076381263", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in pharmacokinetics and molecular biology, with specific expertise in organic cation transporters and in vivo models, aligning closely with the job's requirements for molecular biology techniques and transgenic mouse handling.

{"query": "A 3-year postdoctoral position is available in the Computational Biology and Systems Medicine group led by Marieke Kuijjer at the Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM), Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Nordic EMBL partner (see https://www.kuijjerlab.org/ for more information). The position is part of the recently funded project \"Precision medicine for treatment stratification of metastatic breast cancer\" from the Krafttak mot Kreft campaign, Norwegian Cancer Society. The ideal start date is in winter/spring 2024, but we are flexible and this can be discussed.\nThe group was established in 2018 and focuses on using computational approaches to understand the molecular mechanisms that drive cancer development, progression, and heterogeneity. The group's driving hypothesis is that the complex clinical phenotypes we observe in cancer cannot be adequately defined by individual layers of molecular data. Instead, we must consider the underlying network of interactions between the different biological components that can drive cancer phenotypes. To do so, the group develops computational approaches that place genomic data into the context of large-scale, genome-wide regulatory networks, as well as approaches to analyze such networks for individual cancer patients.\nAmongst others, our current projects aim at developing new computational methods and tools for (1) modeling enhancer-promoter interactions, (2) integration of multi-modal single cell data using deep learning, (3) fine-tuned analysis of genome-wide regulatory networks, (4) integration of patient-specific regulatory networks with multi-omic data, (5) modeling networks based on single cell and spatial transcriptomic data. See also https://kuijjerlab.org for more information.\nThe project aims to develop and use large-scale, genome-wide regulatory network modeling and analyses approaches to obtain a detailed resolution of the regulatory disruptions involved in breast cancer metastasis. The selected candidate's role will be to model gene regulatory networks for individual metastatic breast cancer samples and their primary tumors-of-origin, both on bulk and single-cell data, from publicly available resources as well as in-house data generated through the project.

Epidemiological and animal studies have shown that helminth infections can suppress or exacerbate unrelated autoimmune, allergic, and other inflammatory disorders. There is growing evidence that helminth infection-mediated suppression of bystander inflammatory responses is influenced by alterations in the intestinal microbiome modulating metabolic and immune functions of the infected host.<sep>Abstract Key aspects of microbiome research are accurate identification of taxa followed by the profiling of their functionality. Amplicon profiling based on the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence is a ubiquitous technique to identify and profile the abundances of the various taxa. However, it does not provide information on their encoded functionality. Predictive tools which can accurately extrapolate the functional information of a microbiome based on taxonomic profile composition is essential. At present the applicability of these tools is however limited due to requirement of reference genomes from known species. We present IPCO (Inference of Pathways from Co-variance analysis), a new method of inferring functionality for 16S-based microbiome profiles independent of reference genomes. IPCO utilises the biological co-variance observed between paired taxonomic and functional profiles and co-varies it with the queried dataset. It outperforms other established methods both in terms of sample and feature profile prediction. Validation results confirmed that IPCO can replicate observed biological signals seen within shotgun and metabolite profiles. Comparative analysis of predicted functionality profiles with other popular 16S-based functional prediction tools indicates significantly lower performance with predicted functionality showing little to no correlation with paired shotgun features across samples. IPCO is implemented in R and available from https://github.com/IPCO-Rlibrary/IPCO .<sep>To investigate compositional differences in the gut microbiota associated with bone homeostasis and fractures in a cohort of older adults.Faecal microbiota profiles were determined from 181 individuals with osteopenia (n = 61) or osteoporosis (n = 60), and an age- and gender-matched group with normal BMD (n = 60). Analysis of the 16S (V3-V4 region) amplicon dataset classified to the genus level was used to identify significantly differentially abundant taxa. Adjustments were made for potential confounding variables identified from the literature using several statistical models.We identified six genera that were significantly altered in abundance in the osteoporosis or osteopenic groups compared with age- and gender-matched controls. A detailed study of microbiota associations with meta-data variables that included BMI, health status, diet and medication revealed that these meta-data explained 15-17% of the variance within the microbiota dataset. BMD measurements were significantly associated with alterations in the microbiota. After controlling for known biological confounders, five of the six taxa remained significant. Overall microbiota alpha diversity did not correlate to BMD in this study.Reduced BMD in osteopenia and osteoporosis is associated with an altered microbiota. These alterations may be useful as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in individuals at high risk of reductions in BMD. These observations will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the microbiota and bone homeostasis.<sep>Vitamin K has multiple important physiological roles, including blood coagulation and beneficial effects on myelin integrity in the brain. Some intestinal microbes possess the genes to produce vitamin K in the form of menaquinone (MK). MK appears in higher concentration in tissues, such as the brain, particularly MK4, than the dietary form of phylloquinone (PK). Lower PK concentrations have been reported in patients with Alzheimer disease while higher serum PK concentrations have been positively associated with verbal episodic memory. Despite knowledge of the importance of vitamin K for various health parameters, few studies have measured MK concentration and biosynthesis by gut commensals.The aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between genes involved in gut-microbiota derived MK, concentrations of MK isoforms, and cognitive function.Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome of 74 elderly individuals with different cognitive ability levels was performed. From this, gene counts for microbial MK biosynthesis were determined. Associations between clusters of individuals, grouped based on a similar presence and prevalence of MK biosynthesis genes, and cognitive ability were investigated. Fecal MK concentrations were quantified by HPLC to investigate correlations with subject clusters.Separation of subject groups defined by banded quantification of the genetic potential of their microbiome to biosynthesize MK was associated with significant differences in cognitive ability [assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)]. Three MK isoforms were found to be positively associated with MMSE, along with the identification of key components of the MK pathway that drive this association. Although the causality and direction of these associations remain unknown, these findings justify further studies.This study provides evidence that although total concentrations of MK did not covary with cognition, certain MK isoforms synthesized by the gut microbiome, particularly the longer chains, are positively associated with cognition.<sep>There are complex interactions between aging, frailty, diet, and the gut microbiota; modulation of the gut microbiota by diet could lead to healthier aging. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of diets differing in sugar, fat, and fiber content upon the gut microbiota of mice humanized with microbiota from healthy or frail older people. We also performed a 6-month dietary fiber supplementation in three human cohorts representing three distinct life-stages. Mice were colonized with human microbiota and then underwent an 8-week dietary intervention with either a high-fiber/low-fat diet typical of elderly community dwellers or a low-fiber/high-fat diet typical of long-stay residential care subjects. A cross-over design was used where the diets were switched after 4 weeks to the other diet type to identify responsive taxa and innate immunity changes. In the human intervention, the subjects supplemented their normal diet with a mix of five prebiotics (wheat dextrin, resistant starch, polydextrose, soluble corn fiber, and galactooligo-saccharide) at 10 g/day combined total, for healthy subjects and 20 g/day for frail subjects, or placebo (10 g/day maltodextrin) for 26 weeks. The gut microbiota was profiled and immune responses were assayed by T cell markers in mice, and serum cytokines in humans. Humanized mice maintained gut microbiota types reflecting the respective healthy or frail human donor. Changes in abundance of specific taxa occurred with the diet switch. In mice with the community type microbiota, the observed differences reflected compositions previously associated with higher frailty. The dominance of Prevotella present initially in community inoculated mice was replaced by Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Oscillibacter. Frail type microbiota showed a differential effect on innate immune markers in both conventional and germ-free mice, but a moderate number of taxonomic changes occurring upon diet switch with an increase in abundance of Parabacteroides, Blautia, Clostridium cluster IV, and Phascolarctobacterium. In the human intervention, prebiotic supplementation did not drive any global changes in alpha- or beta-diversity, but the abundance of certain bacterial taxa, particularly Ruminococcaceae (Clostridium cluster IV), Parabacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, increased, and levels of the chemokine CXCL11 were significantly lower in the frail elderly group, but increased during the wash-out period. Switching to a nutritionally poorer diet has a profound effect on the microbiota in mouse models, with changes in the gut microbiota from healthy donors reflecting previously observed differences between elderly frail and non-frail individuals. However, the frailty-associated gut microbiota did not reciprocally switch to a younger healthy-subject like state, and supplementation with prebiotics was associated with fewer detected effects in humans than diet adjustment in animal models.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Breakthrough bleeding<sep>Thrombus<sep>Disease<sep>ADAMTS13<sep>Venous thrombosis<sep>Autopsy<sep>Thrombosis<sep>Vaccination<sep>Platelet activation<sep>Whole blood<sep>Apixaban<sep>Rivaroxaban<sep>Heparin<sep>Innate immune system<sep>Prothrombin complex concentrate<sep>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia<sep>Calprotectin<sep>PROTHROMBIN COMPLEX<sep>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sep>Inflammation<sep>Pandemic<sep>Immune system<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Activated clotting time<sep>Platelet<sep>Thromboelastometry<sep>Population<sep>Recombinant factor VIIa<sep>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura<sep>Clotting time<sep>Headaches<sep>Coagulation<sep>Case fatality rate<sep>Inflammatory bowel disease<sep>Neutrophil extracellular traps</keyword><title>Thrombosis and Thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccination<sep>Elevated NETs and Calprotectin Levels after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccination Correlate with the Severity of Side Effects<sep>Vaccine Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Causing a Severe Form of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis With High Fatality Rate: A Case Series<sep><scp>DNase</scp> analysed by a novel competitive assay in patients with complications after <scp>ChAdOx1 nCoV</scp>‐19 vaccination and in normal unvaccinated blood donors<sep>Investigation of the Optimal Dose aPCC in Reversing the Effect of Factor Xa Inhibitors—An In Vitro Study<sep>Immune complexes, innate immunity, and NETosis in ChAdOx1 vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia<sep>In Vitro Apixaban Removal By CytoSorb Whole Blood Adsorber: An Experimental Study<sep>Vaccine associated benign headache and cutaneous hemorrhage after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine: A cohort study<sep>The effect of emicizumab and bypassing agents in patients with hemophilia – An in vitro study<sep>Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and COVID‐19: Impacts of vaccination and infection inrare disease</title><abstract>We report findings in five patients who presented with venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 7 to 10 days after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral vector vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patients were health care workers who were 32 to 54 years of age. All the patients had high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4-polyanion complexes; however, they had had no previous exposure to heparin. Because the five cases occurred in a population of more than 130,000 vaccinated persons, we propose that they represent a rare vaccine-related variant of spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia that we refer to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.<sep>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination has been associated with the rare side effect; vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). The mechanism of thrombosis in VITT is associated with high levels of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The present study examines whether key markers for NETosis, such as H3-NETs and calprotectin, as well as syndecan-1 for endotheliopathy, can be used as prognostic factors to predict the severity of complications associated with ChAdOx1 vaccination. Five patients with VITT, 10 with prolonged symptoms and cutaneous hemorrhages but without VITT, and 15 with only brief and mild symptoms after the vaccination were examined. Levels of H3-NETs and calprotectin in the vaccinated individuals were markedly increased in VITT patients compared to vaccinees with milder vaccination-associated symptoms, and a strong correlation (r ≥ 0.745, p < 0.001) was found with severity of vaccination side effects. Syndecan-1 levels were also positively correlated (r = 0.590, p < 0.001) in vaccinees to side effects after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. We hypothesize that the inflammatory markers NETs and calprotectin may be used as confirmatory tests in diagnosing VITT.<sep>During a 2-week period, we have encountered five cases presenting with the combination of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), intracerebral hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia. A clinical hallmark was the rapid and severe progression of disease in spite of maximum treatment efforts, resulting in fatal outcome in for 4 out of 5 patients. All cases had received ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine 1–2 weeks earlier and developed a characteristic syndrome thereafter. The rapid progressive clinical course and high fatality rate of CVT in combination with thrombocytopenia in such a cluster and in otherwise healthy adults is a recent phenomenon. Cerebral autopsy findings were those of venous hemorrhagic infarctions and thrombi in dural venous sinuses, including thrombus material apparently rich in thrombocytes, leukocytes and fibrin. Vessel walls were free of inflammation. Extra-cerebral manifestations included leech-like thrombi in large veins, fibrin clots in small venules and scattered hemorrhages on skin and membranes. CVT with thrombocytopenia after adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccination is a new clinical syndrome that needs to be recognized by clinicians, is challenging to treat and seems associated with a high mortality rate.<sep>Abstract Increased levels of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been detected in individuals with vaccine complications after the ChAdOx1 nCov vaccine with a correlation between the severity of vaccine side effects and the level of NETosis. DNases may disrupt NETs by degrading their content of DNA, and a balance has been reported between NETs and DNases. Because of this and since the inflammatory marker NETs may be used as a confirmatory test in diagnosing VITT, it is of interest to monitor levels of DNase in patients with increased NETs levels. The current novel rapid DNase ELISA was tested in blood samples of patients with known increased levels of NETs with or without VITT after ChAdOx1 nCoV‐19 vaccination. DNase levels in VITT patients were significantly increased compared with normal unvaccinated blood donors and compared with patients with post‐vaccination symptoms but not VITT. However, since EDTA was found to inhibit DNase, serum and not EDTA‐plasma samples should be applied for DNase testing. The novel DNase assay may serve as a supplementary test to the NETs test when analysing samples from patients with suspected increased NETs levels.<sep>Factor (F) Xa inhibitors are safe and effective alternatives to warfarin. There are concerns about the lack of a reversal strategy in case of serious bleeds or need for emergency surgery in situations when the antidote andexanet alfa is not available. Factor concentrates are widely used, but there are few clinical studies regarding the reversal effect of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC). Because of the feared thrombogenicity, administration of the lowest effective dose would be desirable. To determine the lowest concentration of aPCC sufficient to reverse the effect of rivaroxaban and apixaban. Blood from 18 healthy volunteers were supplemented with apixaban or rivaroxaban. aPCC was added to obtain 10 different concentrations ranging from 0.08-1.60 U/mL. Thromboelastometry and thrombin generation assay were used to assess the reversal effect. aPCC concentrations of 0.08 and 0.16 U/mL restored thromboelastometry clotting time to baseline in apixaban (P = 1.0) and rivaroxaban (P = 1.0)-containing samples, respectively. The concentrations 0.08 U/mL (P = 0.5) and 0.24 U/mL (P = 0.2) were sufficient to restore thrombin generation. Concentrations of 0.56 U/mL and higher, caused significantly higher ETP than baseline in apixaban-containing samples (P < 0.05). aPCC concentrations lower than previously reported were effective in reversing the effect of FXa inhibitors in vitro.<sep>We recently reported five cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) 7-10 days after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral vector vaccine against corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to investigate the pathogenic immunological responses operating in these patients.We assessed circulating inflammatory markers by immune assays and immune cell phenotyping by flow cytometry analyses and performed immunoprecipitation with anti-platelet factor (PF)4 antibody in plasma samples followed by mass spectrometry from all five patients. A thrombus was retrieved from the sinus sagittal superior of one patient and analysed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Precipitated immune complexes revealed multiple innate immune pathway triggers for platelet and leucocyte activation. Plasma contained increased levels of innate immune response cytokines and markers of systemic inflammation, extensive degranulation of neutrophils, and tissue and endothelial damage. Blood analyses showed activation of neutrophils and increased levels of circulating H3Cit, dsDNA, and myeloperoxidase-DNA complex. The thrombus had extensive infiltration of neutrophils, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and IgG deposits.The results show that anti-PF4/polyanion IgG-mediated thrombus formation in VITT patients is accompanied by a massive innate immune activation and particularly the fulminant activation of neutrophils including NETosis. These results provide novel data on the immune response in this rare adenoviral vector-induced VITT.<sep>The use of unopposed oral anticoagulants while undergoing cardiothoracic surgery is associated with severe bleeding and increased morbidity. The aim of this experimental study was to examine if the apixaban concentration in reconstituted blood could be reduced in an in vitro setup by the use of CytoSorb whole blood adsorber, and to study how this affected global coagulation assays.An experimental study performed in a laboratory.An in vitro setup with reconstituted whole blood.Reconstituted whole blood spiked with apixaban circulated in an in vitro circuit with the CytoSorb 300 mL device connected.Blood samples were drawn at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes of adsorption. The apixaban concentration was measured at each time point. In addition, the global coagulation assays, thromboelastometry clotting time and thrombin generation, were performed, and the results were compared with baseline values obtained before spiking blood with apixaban. After 30 minutes of adsorption, the mean apixaban concentration was reduced from 414.3 (±69.1) ng/mL to 33 (±11.4) ng/mL. Thrombin generation showed maximum effect after 60 minutes, and the thromboelastometry clotting time was close to baseline values after 120 minutes.In this in vitro study, apixaban concentrations were effectively reduced, and the clotting time and thrombin generation assays were normalized by the use of CytoSorb whole blood adsorber.<sep>Fatal complications have occurred after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, a vaccine against Covid-19. Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) with severe outcome is characterized by venous thrombosis, predominantly in cerebral veins, thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies. Prolonged headaches and cutaneous hemorrhages, frequently observed after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, have therefore caused anxiety among vaccinees. We investigated whether these symptoms represent a mild form of VITT, with a potential for aggravation, e.g. in case of a second vaccination dose, or a different entity of vaccine complications MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included previously healthy individuals who had a combination of headache and spontaneous severe cutaneous hemorrhages emerging after the 1st dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Twelve individuals were found to meet the inclusion criteria, and a phone interview, cerebral MRI, assessment of platelet counts, anti PF4/polyanion antibodies and other laboratory tests were performed.None of the symptomatic vaccinees had cerebral vein thrombosis, hemorrhage or other pathology on MRI. Platelet counts were within normal range and no anti-PF4/polyanion platelet activating antibodies were found. Moreover, vasculitis markers, platelet activation markers and thrombin generation were normal. Furthermore, almost all symptoms resolved, and none had recurrence of symptoms after further vaccination with mRNA vaccines against Covid-19.The combination of headaches and subcutaneous hemorrhage did not represent VITT and no other specific coagulation disorder or intracranial pathology was found. However, symptoms initially mimicking VITT demand vigilance and low threshold for a clinical evaluation combined with platelet counts and D-dimer.<sep>Background Emicizumab is a nonfactor replacement therapy for hemophilia A (HA) and is a bispecific monoclonal antibody mimicking factor VIII by binding both factors IXa and X. Although it reduces the frequency of bleeding episodes, there is still need for bypassing agents in case of breakthrough bleeds or need for surgery. The HAVEN-1 study showed an increased risk of thrombotic events and episodes of thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with simultaneous treatment with emicizumab and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) in high doses (>100 U/kg daily) for more than 1 day, and it is suspected that these drugs have a synergistic hemostatic effect. Objectives To evaluate and compare the hemostatic effect of bypassing agents in vitro in people with HA before and after starting treatment with emicizumab to investigate if dosing should be adjusted to optimize treatment. Patients/Methods Blood collected before and after start of treatment with emicizumab was spiked with aPCC and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) at different concentrations. The effect of aPCC and rFVIIa was assessed by thrombin generation assay and thromboelastometry. Results Six people with HA were included. The response to aPCC in thrombin generation after starting emicizumab was significantly stronger than before. This synergistic effect was less pronounced for emicizumab and rFVIIa. Furthermore, aPCC shortened thromboelastometry clotting time more effectively after starting emicizumab than before starting this treatment. Conclusions We demonstrated a strong synergistic effect of emicizumab and aPCC and a similar but less pronounced effect of rFVIIa in people treated with emicizumab.<sep>Severe COVID-19 is associated with an important increase of von Willebrand factor and mild lowering of ADAMTS13 activity that may, in the presence of a strong inflammatory reaction, increase the risk of acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Although acute episodes of immune-mediated TTP associated with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported, data about clinical evolution of hereditary TTP (hTTP) during the pandemic are scarce.We conducted a survey among adult patients of the International Hereditary TTP Registry about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, COVID-19, and occurrence of acute hTTP episodes.Of 122 adult hTTP patients invited to participate, 86 (70.5%) responded. Sixty-five had been vaccinated (75.6%), of which 14 had received in addition a booster, resulting in 139 individual vaccine shots. Although vaccinations in patients on plasma prophylaxis were done within 1 week of the last plasma infusion, all 23 patients treated with plasma on demand were vaccinated without prior plasma infusions. One patient on uninterrupted weekly plasma infusions presented within 3 days from his second vaccination with neurological symptoms and computed tomography scan 9 days later showed subacute ischemic/hemorrhagic frontal lobe infarction. A second male patient developed acute myocarditis after his second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Twelve (14%) patients had COVID-19, associated with an acute hTTP episode in three of them: one patient had a transient ischemic attack, one a stroke, and a pregnant woman was hospitalized to intensify plasma treatment.The risk of an acute episode triggered by COVID-19 seems higher than following vaccination in hTTP patients, who can be safely vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/12810742", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5009977791", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5090314016", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in computational biology and microbiome research, with a focus on genomics and network analysis, aligning well with the job's requirements for computational approaches to cancer research.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and extent of disease of the patients who became resectable after PIPAC and undergone cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).<sep>Background: Pressurized intraperitoneal chemotherapy(PIPAC) is a relatively new drug delivery method used in patients with peritoneal metastases of primary or secondary origin. Oxaliplatin was reluctantly used in PIPAC due to feared toxicity, especially abdominal pain. The objective of this multiinstitutional study is to assess oxaliplatin-associated tolerance profile on a large cohort of patients.<sep>To support the global restart of elective surgery, data from an international prospective cohort study of 8492 patients (69 countries) was analysed using artificial intelligence (machine learning techniques) to develop a predictive score for mortality in surgical patients with SARS-CoV-2. We found that patient rather than operation factors were the best predictors and used these to create the COVIDsurg Mortality Score (https://covidsurgrisk.app). Our data demonstrates that it is safe to restart a wide range of surgical services for selected patients.<sep>With at least 28 elective million operations delayed during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients who will require surgery after a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to increase rapidly1. Operating on patients with an active perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection is now known to carry a very high pulmonary complication and mortality rate2. Urgent information is needed to guide whether postponing surgery in patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a clinical benefit, and the optimal length of delay.<sep>Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a common evolution of abdominal cancers. It may arise from the peritoneum itself (primary) or originate from another type of cancer especially those of gastrointestinal or gynecological origin (secondary). Without aggressive multimodal therapeutic approaches, PC is associated with a poor prognosis. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) have been used to treat PC since 1990. In Saudi Arabia, the first CRS and HIPEC were done in 2008. In 2018, Saudi Arabia population is 32 millions of people and the demand for such procedures has grown up. This article gives outlines<sep>Peritoneal metastasis (PM) of colorectal cancer (CRC) origin can be treated and cured. This article presents a practical guide for CRC surgeons facing a patient with PM and presents the different options of treatment at expert centers on peritoneal surface malignancies. The unexpected finding of PM could be overwhelming, especially during an emergency CRC surgery. Clear indications on managing these situations call for clarification to avoid any negative impact on the oncologic outcome of patients with CRC. All patients with PM of CRC origin must be evaluated by a tumor board or multidisciplinary team specialized in<sep>Corona virus-induced disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has globally affected the surgical treatment of cancer patients and has challenged the ethical principles of surgical oncologists around the world.

The survey consisted of 29 closed-ended questions and was conducted over a period of 24 days beginning in March 26, 2020.Overall, 394 surgical oncologists from 41 different countries answered the questionnaire. The predominant guiding principle was \"saving lives\" 240 (62%), and the different aspects of lock-down<sep>Background The aim of this study was to analyse survival and surrogates for oncological response after PIPAC for appendiceal tumours. Methods This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients with appendiceal peritoneal metastases (PM) treated in experienced PIPAC centers. Primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS) from the date of diagnosis of PM and from the start of PIPAC. Predefined secondary outcome included radiological response (RECIST criteria), repeat laparoscopy and peritoneal cancer index (PCI), histological response assessed by the Peritoneal regression grading system (PRGS) and clinical response. Results Final analysis included 77 consecutive patients (208 PIPAC procedures)<sep>Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is increasingly used to treat patients with peritoneal cancer. A recent survey demonstrated considerable diversification of current practice of PIPAC raising issues of concern also regarding safety and efficacy. The study aim was to reach consensus on best practice of PIPAC treatment.Current practice was critically discussed during an expert meeting and the available evidence was scrutinized to elaborate a 33-item closed-ended questionnaire. All active PIPAC centers were then invited to participate in an online two-round Delphi process with 3 reminders at least. Consensus was defined a priori as >70% agreement for<sep>Peritoneal surface malignancies comprise a heterogeneous group of primary tumours, including peritoneal mesothelioma, and peritoneal metastases of other tumours, including ovarian, gastric, colorectal, appendicular or pancreatic cancers. The pathophysiology of peritoneal malignancy is complex and not fully understood. The two main hypotheses are the transformation of mesothelial cells (peritoneal primary tumour) and shedding of cells from a primary tumour with implantation of cells in the peritoneal cavity (peritoneal metastasis). Diagnosis is challenging and often requires modern imaging and interventional techniques, including surgical exploration. In the past decade, new treatments and multimodal strategies helped to improve patient<sep>Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP) and Peritoneal Mesothelioma (PM) are both rare peritoneal malignancies. Currently, affected patients may be treated with Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy offering long-term survival or even cure in selected patients. However, many issues regarding the optimal treatment strategy are currently under debate. To aid physicians involved in the treatment of these patients in clinical decision making, the PSOGI executive committee proposed to create a consensus statement on PMP and PM. This manuscript describes the methodology of the consensus process. The Delphi technique is a reliable method for attaining consensus on a topic<sep>Safe implementation and thorough evaluation of new treatments require prospective data monitoring and standardization of treatments. Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a promising alternative for the treatment of patients with peritoneal disease with an increasing number of suggested drug regimens. The aim was to reach expert consensus on current PIPAC treatment protocols and to define the most important research topics.The expert panel included the most active PIPAC centers, organizers of PIPAC courses and principal investigators of prospective studies on PIPAC.

Progression has been defined as an increase of PRGS between first and third PIPAC procedures (iPRGS). iPRGSand positive peritoneal cytology were not associated with prognostic impact. These results may be explained by a lack of statistical power. Also, it is not known whether the mean or the highest PRGS among taken peritoneal biopsies bears the highest clinical value. We therefore conducted the largest prospective study<sep>SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with an increased rate of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients. Since surgical patients are already at higher risk of venous thromboembolism than general populations, this study aimed to determine if patients with peri-operative or prior SARS-CoV-2 were at further increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We conducted a planned sub-study and analysis from an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of elective and emergency patients undergoing surgery during October 2020.

We conducted a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) of AD-associated loci from GWASs using untargeted metabolic profiling (metabolomics) by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). We identified an association of lactosylceramides (LacCer) with AD-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCA7 (P = 5.0 × 10-5 to 1.3 × 10-44). We showed that plasma LacCer concentrations are associated with cognitive performance and genetically modified levels of LacCer are associated with AD risk. We then showed that concentrations of sphingomyelins, ceramides, and hexosylceramides were altered in brain tissue from Abca7 knockout mice, compared with wild type (WT) (P = 0.049-1.4 × 10-5), but not in a mouse model of amyloidosis. Furthermore, activation of microglia increases intracellular concentrations of hexosylceramides in part through induction in the expression of sphingosine kinase, an enzyme with a high control coefficient for sphingolipid and ceramide synthesis. Our work suggests that the risk for AD arising from functional variations in ABCA7 is mediated at least in part through ceramides. Modulation of their metabolism or downstream signaling may offer new therapeutic opportunities for AD.<sep>Metabolic inflexibility is a characteristic of insulin resistance, limiting the ability to transiently regulate oxidative metabolism and gene expression in response to nutrient availability. Little is known of the flexibility of post-transcriptional regulation, including circulatory miRNAs (c-miRNAs).The abundances of targeted c-miRNAs, with reported functions in metabolic regulation, were analysed in response to a high-carbohydrate meal in healthy weight insulin-sensitive (IS) and overweight insulin-resistant (IR) women.Age-matched healthy weight IS (n = 20, BMI = 24.3 ± 0.70) and overweight IR (n = 20, BMI = 28.6 ± 0.67) women.An abundance of c-miRNAs was quantified prior to and following a high-carbohydrate breakfast meal (2500 kJ; 50% carbohydrate, 20% fat and 27% protein). Target genes of the differentially regulated c-miRNA were measured in RNA extracted from circulatory peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).In healthy weight IS women, both miR-15a-5p (p = 0.03) and miR-17-5p (p < 0.01) levels were halved at 4 h post-meal. These miRNA remained unaltered following the same meal in the overweight IR women. Furthermore, amongst genes targeted by these miRNA, CPT1A (p = 0.01) and IL8 (p = 0.03) had also reduced expression 4 h post-meal only in the healthy weight IS women.The study findings provide preliminary evidence for a possible extension of metabolic inflexibility to include c-miRNAs.The clinical trial is registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry under Trial registration: ANZCTR: ACTRN12615001108505. Registered on 21 October 2015.<sep>High protein diets may improve the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass in the elderly, although it remains less clear what broader impact such diets have on whole body metabolic regulation in the elderly. Non-targeted polar metabolomics analysis using HILIC HPLC-MS was used to profile the circulating plasma metabolome of elderly men (n = 31; 74.7 ± 4.0 years) who were randomized to consume for 10 weeks a diet designed to achieve either protein (RDA; 0.8·g-1·kg-1) or that doubled this recommend intake (2RDA; 1.6.g.kg-1). A limited number of plasma metabolites (n = 24) were significantly differentially regulated by the diet. These included markers of protein anabolism, which increased by the 2RDA diet, including; urea, creatine, and glutarylcarnitine. Whilst in response to the RDA diet; glutamine, glutamic acid, and proline were increased, relative to the 2RDA diet (p < 0.05). Metaboanalyst identified six major metabolic pathways to be influenced by the quantity of protein intake, most notably the arginine and proline pathways. Doubling of the recommended protein intake in older males over 10 weeks exerted only a limited impact on circulating metabolites, as determined by LC-MS. This metabolomic response was almost entirely due to increased circulating abundances of metabolites potentially indicative of altered protein anabolism, without evidence of impact on pathways for metabolic health. Trial Registration: This trial was registered on 3rd March 2016 at the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (www.anzctr.org.au) at ACTRN 12616000310460.<sep>Metabolomic dysregulation following a meal in overweight individuals with the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) involves multiple pathways of nutrient storage and oxidation.The aim of the current study was to perform an acute cross-over intervention to examine the interactive actions of meal glycaemic load (GL) on the dynamic responses of the plasma metabolome in overweight females.Postmenopausal women [63 ± 1.23y; Healthy (n = 20) and MetS (n = 20)] ingested two differing high-carbohydrate test meals (73 g carbohydrate; 51% energy) composed of either low glycemic index (LGI) or high (HGI) foods in a randomised sequence. Plasma metabolome was analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).In the overweight women with MetS, there were suppressed postprandial responses for several amino acids (AAs), including phenylalanine, leucine, valine, and tryptophan, p < 0.05), irrespective of the meal type. Meal GL exerted a limited impact on the overall metabolomic response, although the postprandial levels of alanine were higher with the low GL meal and uric acid was greater following the high GL meal (p < 0.05).MetS participants exhibited reduced differences in the concentrations of a small set of AAs and a limited group of metabolites implicated in energy metabolism following the meals. However, the manipulation of meal GL had minimal impact on the postprandial metabolome. This study suggests that the GL of a meal is not a major determinant of postprandial response, with a greater impact exerted by the metabolic health of the individual.

Despite increasing evidence of important metabolic dysregulation in AD, the underlying metabolic changes that may impact amyloid plaque formation are not understood, particularly for late onset AD. This study analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptomics and proteomics data obtained from several data repositories to obtain differentially expressed (DE) multi-omics elements in mouse models of AD. We characterized the metabolic modulation in these datasets using gene ontology, and transcription factor, pathway and cell-type enrichment analysis. A predicted lipid signature was extracted from genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN) and subsequently validated in a lipidomic dataset derived from cortical tissue of ABCA7-null mice, a mouse model of one of the genes associated with late onset AD. Moreover, a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) was performed to further characterize the association between dysregulated lipid metabolism in human blood serum and AD. We found 203 DE transcripts, 164 DE proteins and 58 DE GWAS-derived mouse orthologs associated with significantly enriched metabolic biological processes. Lipid and bioenergetics metabolic pathways were significantly over-represented across the AD multi-omics datasets. Microglia and astrocytes were significantly enriched in the lipid-predominant AD-metabolic transcriptome. We also extracted a predicted lipid signature that was validated and robustly modelled class separation in the ABCA7 mice cortical lipidome, with 11 of these lipid species exhibiting statistically significant modulations. MWAS revealed 298 AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-metabolite associations, of which 70% corresponded to lipid classes. These results support the importance of lipid metabolism dysregulation in AD and highlight the suitability of mapping AD multi-omics data into GSMNs to identify metabolic alterations.<sep>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder.

In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics, it is especially hard to combine untargeted datasets since the majority of metabolomic features are not annotated and thus cannot be matched by chemical identity. Typically, the information available for each feature is retention time (RT), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and feature intensity (FI). Pairs of features from the same metabolite in separate datasets can exhibit small but significant differences, making matching very challenging. Current methods to address this issue are too simple or rely on assumptions that cannot be met in all cases. We present a method to find feature correspondence between two similar LC-MS metabolomics experiments or batches using only the features' RT, m/z, and FI. We demonstrate the method on both real and synthetic datasets, using six orthogonal validation strategies to gauge the matching quality. In our main example, 4953 features were uniquely matched, of which 585 (96.8%) of 604 manually annotated features were correct. In a second example, 2324 features could be uniquely matched, with 79 (90.8%) out of 87 annotated features correctly matched. Most of the missed annotated matches are between features that behave very differently from modeled inter-dataset shifts of RT, MZ, and FI. In a third example with simulated data with 4755 features per dataset, 99.6% of the matches were correct. Finally, the results of matching three other dataset pairs using our method are compared with a published alternative method, metabCombiner, showing the advantages of our approach. The method can be applied using M2S (Match 2 Sets), a free, open-source MATLAB toolbox, available at https://github.com/rjdossan/M2S.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Preeclampsia<sep>Infertility<sep>Dicer<sep>Placentation<sep>Decidualization<sep>Decidual cells<sep>Stromal cell<sep>Trophoblast<sep>Endometrium<sep>Spiral artery<sep>Decidua<sep>Inflammation<sep>Influenza A virus<sep>Drosha<sep>Inflammasome<sep>Virus</keyword><title>MicroRNA Biogenesis Machinery Is Dysregulated in the Endometrium of Infertile Women Suggesting a Role in Receptivity and Infertility<sep>Galectin-7 Impairs Placentation and Causes Preeclampsia Features in Mice<sep>Repurposing drugs targeting the <scp>P2X7</scp> receptor to limit hyperinflammation and disease during influenza virus infection<sep>Endometrial stromal cell miR-19b-3p release is reduced during decidualization implying a role in decidual-trophoblast cross-talk</title><abstract>MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate endometrial function and their dysregulation could underlie unexplained infertility in women. Ribonucleases including DICER and DROSHA, and the proteins, ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO 1) and 2 (AGO 2) regulate the biogenesis/maturation of miRs. We aimed to elucidate the expression and localization of miR biogenesis machinery components during the human menstrual cycle and compare their levels in endometrium from women with normal fertility and primary unexplained infertility. miR biogenesis components were measured by quantitative-RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In the endometrium of women with normal fertility, DROSHA immunolocalized maximally to the epithelium during the early and mid-secretory phases compared with the proliferative and late-secretory phases. Stromal DICER immunostaining intensity was higher in the late-secretory phase compared with all other phases in fertile women. DROSHA mRNA was reduced in the mid-secretory-infertile whole endometrial tissue (has all cells of the tissue), and primary epithelial and stromal cells while no differences were found in DICER, AGO1, and AGO2 mRNA. In the luminal epithelium, DROSHA staining intensity was reduced in early and mid-secretory-infertile while DICER staining was reduced in the early secretory-infertile compared with their respective fertile groups. DICER and DROSHA were dynamically regulated across the menstrual cycle and reduced levels during receptivity phase could underlie implantation failure/infertility.<sep>Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy-induced disorder unique to humans. The etiology of preeclampsia is poorly understood; however, poor placental formation is thought causal. Galectin-7 is produced by trophoblast and is elevated in first-trimester serum of women who subsequently develop preeclampsia. We hypothesized that elevated placental galectin-7 may be causative of preeclampsia. Here, we demonstrated increased galectin-7 production in chorionic villous samples from women who subsequently develop preterm preeclampsia compared with uncomplicated pregnancies. In vitro, galectin-7 impaired human first-trimester trophoblast outgrowth, increased placental production of the antiangiogenic sFlt-1 splice variant, sFlt-1-e15a , and reduced placental production and secretion of ADAM12 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase12) and angiotensinogen. In vivo, galectin-7 administration (E8–E12) to pregnant mice caused elevated systolic blood pressure, albuminuria, impaired placentation (reduced labyrinth vascular branching, impaired decidual spiral artery remodeling, and a proinflammatory placental state demonstrated by elevated IL1β, IL6 and reduced IL10), and dysregulated expression of renin-angiotensin system components in the placenta, decidua, and kidney, including angiotensinogen, prorenin, and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Collectively, this study demonstrates that elevated galectin-7 during placental formation contributes to abnormal placentation and suggests that it leads to the development of preeclampsia via altering placental production of sFlt-1 and renin-angiotensin system components. Targeting galectin-7 may be a new treatment option for preeclampsia.<sep>Background and Purpose Severe influenza A virus (IAV) infections are associated with damaging hyperinflammation that can be fatal. There is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic agents to treat severe and pathogenic IAV infections. Repurposing of drugs with an existing and studied pharmacokinetic and safety profile is a highly attractive potential strategy. We have previously demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays time‐dependent roles during severe IAV infection with early protective responses and later dysregulation leading to excessive inflammation, contributing to disease severity. Experimental Approach We tested two existing drugs, probenecid and AZ11645373, to target P2X7 receptor signalling and dampen NLRP3 inflammasome responses during severe IAV infection. In vitro, the drugs were assessed for their ability to limit NLRP3 inflammasome‐dependent IL‐1β secretion in macrophage cultures. In vivo, their effects were assessed on hyperinflammation and disease during severe IAV infection in C57BL/6 mice. Key Results Treatment of macrophages with probenecid or AZ11645373 in vitro diminished NLRP3 inflammasome‐dependent IL‐1β secretion. Intranasal therapeutic treatment of mice displaying severe influenza disease with probenecid or AZ11645373 reduced pro‐inflammatory cytokine production, cellular infiltrates in the lung, and provided protection against disease. Importantly, these drugs could be administered at either early or late stage of disease and provide therapeutic efficacy. Conclusions and Implications Our study demonstrates that the anti‐inflammatory drugs probenecid and AZ11645373, which have documented pharmacokinetics and safety profiles in humans, are effective at dampening hyperinflammation and severe influenza disease providing potentially new therapeutic strategies for treating severe or pathogenic IAV infections.<sep>A healthy pregnancy requires successful blastocyst implantation into an adequately prepared or 'receptive' endometrium. Decidualization of uterine endometrial stromal fibroblast cells (hESF) is critical for the establishment of a healthy pregnancy. microRNAs (miRs) are critical regulators of cellular function that can be released by a donor cell to influence the physiological state of recipient cells. We aimed to determine how decidualization affects hESF miR release and investigated the function of one decidualization regulated miR, miR-19b-3p, previously shown to be associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.miR release by hESF was determined by miR microarray on culture media from hESF decidualized in vitro for 3 and 14 days by treatment with oestradiol and medroxyprogesterone acetate. Cellular and whole endometrial/decidual tissue miR expression was quantified by qPCR and localized by in situ hybridization. The function of miR-19b-3p in HTR8/Svneo trophoblast cells was investigated using real time cell analysis (xCELLigence) and gene expression qPCR.From our miR screen we found that essentially all hESF miR release was reduced following in vitro decidualization, significantly so for miR-17-5p, miR-21-3p, miR-34c-3p, miR-106b-5p, miR-138-5p, miR-296-5p, miR-323a-3p, miR-342-3p, miR-491-5p, miR-503-5p and miR-542-5p. qPCR demonstrated that miR-19b-3p, 181a-2-3p and miR-409-5p likewise showed a significant reduction in culture media following decidualization but no change was found in cellular miR expression following decidualization. In situ hybridization localized miR-19b-3p to epithelial and stromal cells in the endometrium and qPCR identified that miR-19b-3p was significantly elevated in the cycling endometrium of patients with a history of early pregnancy loss compared to normally fertile controls. Functionally, overexpression of miR-19b-3p significantly reduced HTR8/Svneo trophoblast proliferation and increased HOXA9 expression.Our data demonstrates that decidualization represses miR release by hESFs and overexpression of miR-19b-3p was found in endometrial tissue from patients with a history of early pregnancy loss. miR-19b-3p impaired HTR8/Svneo proliferation implying a role in trophoblast function. Overall we speculate that miR release by hESF may regulate other cell types within the decidua and that appropriate release of miRs by decidualized hESF is essential for healthy implantation and placentation.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/26736/lecturer-student-research-liaison/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5008971955", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5023334205", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong focus on metabolomics and metabolic disease research, which aligns well with the methodological experience in health care research required by the job description.

Multiple investigations were performed, including a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) that was initially felt to show imaging features consistent with a diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic disease (CTED). The patient was referred to a tertiary pulmonary hypertension centre and the possibility of pulmonary vasculitis was raised. Subsequent positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed imaging features supporting this diagnosis. The patient was treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide infusions, following which her symptoms improved. A repeat PET-CT 6 months after treatment showed resolution in pulmonary artery and mediastinal uptake, but persistence of pulmonary artery occlusions on a repeat CTPA. A final diagnosis of pulmonary vasculitis secondary to Behçet’s disease was made.

It is not clear whether this is causative or a bystander of disease and if it carries any prognostic or treatment significance. Objectives: To study autoimmunity in IPAH using a large cross-sectional cohort. Methods: Assessment of the circulating immune cell phenotype was undertaken using flow cytometry, and the profile of serum immunoglobulins was generated using a standardized multiplex array of 19 clinically validated autoantibodies in 473 cases and 946 control subjects. Additional glutathione S-transferase fusion array and ELISA data were used to identify a serum autoantibody to BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2). Clustering analyses and clinical correlations were used to determine associations between immunogenicity and clinical outcomes. Measurements and Main Results: Flow cytometric immune profiling demonstrates that IPAH is associated with an altered humoral immune response in addition to raised IgG3. Multiplexed autoantibodies were significantly raised in IPAH, and clustering demonstrated three distinct clusters: \"high autoantibody,\" \"low autoantibody,\" and a small \"intermediate\" cluster exhibiting high concentrations of ribonucleic protein complex. The high-autoantibody cluster had worse hemodynamics but improved survival. A small subset of patients demonstrated immunoglobulin reactivity to BMPR2. Conclusions: This study establishes aberrant immune regulation and presence of autoantibodies as key features in the profile of a significant proportion of patients with IPAH and is associated with clinical outcomes.<sep>To undertake the first systematic review examining the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to cross-sectional imaging for the diagnosis of acquired pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).Searches of Medline, Embase and Web of Science were undertaken on 1 July 2020. Original publications studying AI applied to cross-sectional imaging for the diagnosis of acquired PAH in adults were identified through two-staged double-blinded review. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies and Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine frameworks. Narrative synthesis was undertaken following Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guidelines. This review received no funding and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (ID:CRD42020196295).Searches returned 476 citations. Three retrospective observational studies, published between 2016 and 2020, were selected for data-extraction. Two methods applied to cardiac-MRI demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with the best model achieving AUC=0.90 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93), 89% sensitivity and 81% specificity. Stronger results were achieved using cardiac-MRI for classification of idiopathic PAH, achieving AUC=0.97 (95% CI: 0.89-1.0), 96% sensitivity and 87% specificity. One study reporting CT-based AI demonstrated lower accuracy, with 64.6% sensitivity and 97.0% specificity.Automated methods for identifying PAH on cardiac-MRI are emerging with high diagnostic accuracy. AI applied to cross-sectional imaging may provide non-invasive support to reduce diagnostic delay in PAH. This would be helped by stronger solutions in other modalities.There is a significant shortage of research in this important area. Early detection of PAH would be supported by further research advances on the promising emerging technologies identified.<sep>While traffic and air pollution exposure is associated with increased mortality in numerous diseases, its association with disease severity and outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains unknown. Exposure to particulate matter with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and indirect measures of traffic-related air pollution (distance to main road and length of roads within buffer zones surrounding residential addresses) were estimated for 301 patients with idiopathic/heritable PAH recruited in the UK National Cohort Study of Idiopathic and Heritable PAH. Associations with transplant-free survival and pulmonary haemodynamic severity at baseline were assessed, adjusting for confounding variables defined a priori . Higher estimated exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with higher risk of death or lung transplant (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.68 (95% CI 1.11–6.47) per 3 μg·m −3 ; p=0.028). This association remained similar when adjusted for potential confounding variables (HR 4.38 (95% CI 1.44–13.36) per 3 μg·m −3 ; p=0.009). No associations were found between NO 2 exposure or other traffic pollution indicators and transplant-free survival. Conversely, indirect measures of exposure to traffic-related air pollution within the 500–1000 m buffer zones correlated with the European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society risk categories as well as pulmonary haemodynamics at baseline. This association was strongest for pulmonary vascular resistance. In idiopathic/heritable PAH, indirect measures of exposure to traffic-related air pollution were associated with disease severity at baseline, whereas higher PM 2.5 exposure may independently predict shorter transplant-free survival.<sep>Background - Approximately 25% of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been found to harbor rare mutations in disease-causing genes. To identify missing heritability in PAH we integrated deep phenotyping with whole-genome sequencing data using Bayesian statistics. Methods - We analyzed 13,037 participants enrolled in the NIHR BioResource - Rare Diseases (NBR) study, of which 1,148 were recruited to the PAH domain. To test for genetic associations between genes and selected phenotypes of pulmonary hypertension (PH), we used the Bayesian rare-variant association method BeviMed. Results - Heterozygous, high impact, likely loss-of-function variants in the Kinase Insert Domain Receptor (KDR) gene were strongly associated with significantly reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (KCO, posterior probability (PP)=0.989) and older age at diagnosis (PP=0.912). We also provide evidence for familial segregation of a rare nonsense KDR variant with these phenotypes. On computed tomographic imaging of the lungs, a range of parenchymal abnormalities were observed in the five patients harboring these predicted deleterious variants in KDR. Four additional PAH cases with rare likely loss-of-function variants in KDR were independently identified in the US PAH Biobank cohort with similar phenotypic characteristics. Conclusions - The Bayesian inference approach allowed us to independently validate KDR, which encodes for the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as a novel PAH candidate gene. Furthermore, this approach specifically associated high impact likely loss-of-function variants in the genetically constrained gene with distinct phenotypes. These findings provide evidence for KDR being a clinically actionable PAH gene and further support the central role of the vascular endothelium in the pathobiology of PAH.<sep>Rare genetic variants cause pulmonary arterial hypertension, but the contribution of common genetic variation to disease risk and natural history is poorly characterised. We tested for genome-wide association for pulmonary arterial hypertension in large international cohorts and assessed the contribution of associated regions to outcomes.We did two separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a meta-analysis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. These GWAS used data from four international case-control studies across 11 744 individuals with European ancestry (including 2085 patients). One GWAS used genotypes from 5895 whole-genome sequences and the other GWAS used genotyping array data from an additional 5849 individuals. Cross-validation of loci reaching genome-wide significance was sought by meta-analysis. Conditional analysis corrected for the most significant variants at each locus was used to resolve signals for multiple associations. We functionally annotated associated variants and tested associations with duration of survival. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint in survival analyses.A locus near SOX17 (rs10103692, odds ratio 1·80 [95% CI 1·55-2·08], p=5·13 × 10-15) and a second locus in HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 (collectively referred to as HLA-DPA1/DPB1 here; rs2856830, 1·56 [1·42-1·71], p=7·65 × 10-20) within the class II MHC region were associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The SOX17 locus had two independent signals associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (rs13266183, 1·36 [1·25-1·48], p=1·69 × 10-12; and rs10103692). Functional and epigenomic data indicate that the risk variants near SOX17 alter gene regulation via an enhancer active in endothelial cells. Pulmonary arterial hypertension risk variants determined haplotype-specific enhancer activity, and CRISPR-mediated inhibition of the enhancer reduced SOX17 expression. The HLA-DPA1/DPB1 rs2856830 genotype was strongly associated with survival. Median survival from diagnosis in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with the C/C homozygous genotype was double (13·50 years [95% CI 12·07 to >13·50]) that of those with the T/T genotype (6·97 years [6·02-8·05]), despite similar baseline disease severity.This is the first study to report that common genetic variation at loci in an enhancer near SOX17 and in HLA-DPA1/DPB1 is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Impairment of SOX17 function might be more common in pulmonary arterial hypertension than suggested by rare mutations in SOX17. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping and survival, and to determine whether HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping improves risk stratification in clinical practice or trials.UK NIHR, BHF, UK MRC, Dinosaur Trust, NIH/NHLBI, ERS, EMBO, Wellcome Trust, EU, AHA, ACClinPharm, Netherlands CVRI, Dutch Heart Foundation, Dutch Federation of UMC, Netherlands OHRD and RNAS, German DFG, German BMBF, APH Paris, INSERM, Université Paris-Sud, and French ANR.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Inositol phosphate<sep>Autophagy<sep>Dictyostelium discoideum<sep>Dictyostelium<sep>mTORC1<sep>Inositol<sep>Mechanism (biology)<sep>Polyphosphate<sep>Labelling<sep>PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway<sep>Function (biology)<sep>Apoptosis<sep>Dravet syndrome<sep>Phosphate<sep>Methionine<sep>Fluorescence<sep>Cannabidiol<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Gene<sep>Signal transduction</keyword><title>A Dictyostelium discoideum mitochondrial fluorescent tagging vector that does not affect respiratory function<sep>Decanoic acid inhibits mTORC1 activity independent of glucose and insulin signaling<sep>Dictyostelium discoideum as a pharmacological model system to study the mechanisms of medicinal drugs and natural products<sep>A new mechanism for cannabidiol in regulating the one‐carbon cycle and methionine levels in <scp><i>Dictyostelium</i></scp> and in mammalian epilepsy models<sep>Phytocannabinoid‐dependent mTORC1 regulation is dependent upon inositol polyphosphate multikinase activity</title><abstract>Visualizing mitochondria in living Dictyostelium discoideum cells using fluorescent dyes is often problematic due to variability in staining, metabolism of the dyes, and unknown potential effects of the dyes on mitochondrial function.

We also show that this labelling has no effect upon mitochondria load or respiratory function.<sep>Significance The mTORC1 complex provides a critical role in cell function, regulating a variety of processes including growth and autophagy. mTORC1 signaling is hyperactivated in a range of common diseases including cancer, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, mTORC1 signaling provides an important target for regulation in many contexts. Here, we show that decanoic acid, a key component of a widely used medicinal diet, reduces mTORC1 activity. We identify this in a tractable model system, and validate it in ex vivo rat brain tissue and in human iPSC-derived astrocytes from patients with a clinically relevant disease. Thus, we provide insight into an easily accessible therapeutic approach for a range of diseases.<sep>Developing novel compounds for the treatment of diseases remains one of the highest priorities in biomedical research, where it is critical to identify their targets and how they work at a cellular level. Most studies in this area employ mammalian models, since rodents or non-human primates are seen as a good approximation for humans. However, using mammalian models can be problematic for a range of reasons, including high genetic redundancy and the essential role for many proteins in development. More importantly, it is very difficult to identify how compounds function at a cellular or molecular level in these models without a previously suggested mechanism or target. So how can we identify targets of medicinal compounds? In this review we outline the use of an innovative and tractable model system, Dictyostelium discoideum, to provide useful insight to the cellular and molecular functions of both therapeutic drugs and pharmacologically active natural products. We outline the advantages of using this model, and then provide a range of exemplar studies using D. discoideum in pharmacological research to demonstrate breakthroughs in understanding the action and effects of compounds, and the subsequent translational of these advances to mammalian models leading to potential improvements in societal health.<sep>Background and Purpose Epidiolex™, a form of highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) derived from Cannabis plants, has demonstrated seizure control activity in patients with Dravet syndrome, without a fully elucidated mechanism of action. We have employed an unbiased approach to investigate this mechanism at a cellular level. Experimental Approach We use a tractable biomedical model organism, Dictyostelium , to identify a protein controlling the effect of CBD and characterize this mechanism. We then translate these results to a Dravet syndrome mouse model and an acute in vitro seizure model. Key Results CBD activity is partially dependent upon the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system component, GcvH1 in Dictyostelium , orthologous to the human glycine cleavage system component H protein, which is functionally linked to folate one‐carbon metabolism (FOCM). Analysis of FOCM components identified a mechanism for CBD in directly inhibiting methionine synthesis. Analysis of brain tissue from a Dravet syndrome mouse model also showed drastically altered levels of one‐carbon components including methionine, and an in vitro rat seizure model showed an elevated level of methionine that is attenuated following CBD treatment. Conclusions and Implications Our results suggest a novel mechanism for CBD in the regulating methionine levels and identify altered one‐carbon metabolism in Dravet syndrome and seizure activity.<sep>Background and Purpose Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to differentially regulate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in preclinical models of disease, where it reduces activity in models of epilepsies and cancer and increases it in models of multiple sclerosis (MS) and psychosis. Here, we investigate the effects of phytocannabinoids on mTORC1 and define a molecular mechanism. Experimental Approach A novel mechanism for phytocannabinoids was identified using the tractable model system, Dictyostelium discoideum . Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we further validate this new mechanism of action. We demonstrate clinical relevance using cells derived from healthy individuals and from people with MS (pwMS). Key Results Both CBD and the more abundant cannabigerol (CBG) enhance mTORC1 activity in D. discoideum . We identify a mechanism for this effect involving inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), where elevated IPMK expression reverses the response to phytocannabinoids, decreasing mTORC1 activity upon treatment, providing new insight on phytocannabinoids' actions. We further validated this mechanism using mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Clinical relevance of this effect was shown in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where CBD and CBG treatment increased mTORC1 activity in cells derived from healthy individuals and decreased mTORC1 activity in cells derived from pwMS. Conclusion and Implications Our findings suggest that both CBD and the abundant CBG differentially regulate mTORC1 signalling through a mechanism dependent on the activity of the upstream IPMK signalling pathway, with potential relevance to the treatment of mTOR‐related disorders, including MS.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/186103/postdoctoral-research-assistant-department-of-biological-science/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5089795511", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5007279803", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A has extensive experience in genetic association studies, genome-wide analysis, and cardiovascular research, aligning closely with the job description's focus on identifying genetic causes of stroke and leading genome-wide analysis.

Of three skill indicators—skill ratio, fee ratio, and total compensation—we find that total compensation best identifies the skilled manager out-of-sample. Investors in value-creating funds benefit from a better risk–return payoff. While hedge funds operate in a less competitive market than mutual funds, incentive fees do not indicate greater skill.

Theory and Evidence on the Stock Market's Reaction to Innovation Announcements</title><abstract>This paper develops and implements an equilibrium model of systemic risk. The model derives a systemic risk measure, loss beta, in characterizing all too-big-to-fail banks using a capital insurance equilibrium. By constructing each bank’s loss portfolio with a recent accounting approach, we perform a comprehensive empirical study of this loss beta measure and document all TBTF banks from 2002 to 2019. Our empirical findings suggest a significant number of too-big-to-fail banks in 2018–2019.<sep>Abstract We study jump variance risk by jointly examining both stock and option markets. We develop a GARCH option pricing model with jump variance dynamics and a nonmonotonic pricing kernel featuring jump variance risk premium. The model yields a closed‐form option pricing formula and improves in fitting index options from 1996 to 2015. The model‐implied jump variance risk premium has predictive power for future market returns. In the cross‐section, heterogeneity in exposures to jump variance risk leads to a 6% difference in risk‐adjusted returns annually.<sep>We study how incentives to boost short-term performance affect longer-term innovation outputs. We find that incentives to meet current-quarter EPS targets using share repurchases are followed by an increase in the quality of future innovation outputs such as forward citation counts and the economic value of patents. This effect can be attributed to the performance pressure that causes firms to make more efficient reallocation of R&D resources and focus more on novel technologies. Our evidence illustrates that not all actions that appear short-termist have adverse long-term consequences but instead can have a bright side.<sep>We decompose the difference between a firm’s market and book values into two components: intangible assets that can be created by competing firms through SG&A/R&D expenditures, and the residual denoted as franchise value (FV). The estimated parameters in the model for creating intangible assets by capitalizing R&D/SG&A expenditures vary significantly across industries. Consistent with FV being a measure of economic rents and quasi-rents, ceteris paribus, higher FV firms face fewer product market threats, have higher markups, and their investments are less sensitive to their total Tobin’s Q. In contrast, firms with higher capitalized intangible assets, face higher product market threats.<sep>This paper documents that policy uncertainty reduces future stock price crash risk. Our tests show that this negative relation is more pronounced among firms with more short-sale constraints, with no actively traded credit default swap contracts, or with higher firm-level political risks. The results from regressions adopting the instrumental variable approach and from a quasi-natural experiment suggest that the negative relation observed between policy uncertainty and stock price crash risk is unlikely to be driven by potential endogeneity. Additional tests show that this negative association is driven by firms’ decreased hoarding of bad news during periods of high policy uncertainty.<sep>We provide plausibly causal evidence for the role of cultural and linguistic diversity in stock price crash risk. Using unique data from China, we show that firms headquartered in linguistically diverse areas, instrumented by the extent of geographical isolation, have higher stock price crash risk, but not higher jump risk. The effect is more pronounced for stocks that are more likely to be held by local investors. Our evidence further shows that linguistic diversity is associated with investor disagreement, and not with companies’ fundamentals, propensities to hoard bad news, or innovation activities. Our results are consistent with models of investor disagreement.<sep>We investigate the effect of diversity on market reactions to financial disclosure. We show elevated trading volume and stock return volatility around earnings announcements for firms headquartered in culturally and linguistically diverse locales. These results continue to hold when earnings announcements contain no news, consistent with investors in diverse locales having elevated heterogeneous interpretations of public announcements. We establish plausible causality by instrumenting local diversity with the extent of geographical isolation. Consistent with models of investor disagreement, further evidence shows that firms headquartered in diverse locales also have more stock price corrections around earnings announcements and are more prone to crash risk.<sep>Abstract Firms can become less innovative following a sudden cash “inflow.” Specifically, multinational firms that were eligible to repatriate (and indeed repatriated) cash to the United States under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) generate less valuable patents than otherwise similar firms. They also explore more. This effect only exists among firms in less competitive industries, firms with lower institutional ownership (IO), and firms with overconfident chief executive officers (CEOs); this effect is mainly driven by the reduction in the value of U.S.-originated patents. Our evidence suggests that, without appropriate governance, a cash windfall may lead managers to engage in riskier innovation strategy, which can destroy value.<sep>Abstract We show that analyst behavior changes in response to a randomly assigned shock that exogenously varies the timeliness and cost of accessing mandatory disclosures in the cross-section of investors: analysts reduce coverage and issue less optimistic, more accurate, less bold, and less informative forecasts. Our evidence indicates that analysts reduce a strategic component of their behavior: the changes are stronger among analysts with more strategic incentives like affiliated or retail-focused analysts. We conclude that mandatory disclosure can substitute for analyst information production, which is constrained by investors’ ability to verify forecasts using corporate filings. Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.<sep>We examine the effect of technology spillovers on the duration of executive compensation contracts. We find that in the presence of greater technology spillovers, firms tend to grant longer duration compensation contracts to their executives. This finding is consistent with theoretical predictions by Manso (2011) who argues that firms should choose longer-term contracts to encourage managerial incentives for exploration. We enhance our identification by using exogenous variation in state-level R&D tax credits of peer firms to identify the effect of technology spillovers on the duration of focal firm compensation structures. We also find this effect to be stronger among younger firms and firms with more growth opportunities. Overall, our findings suggest that technology spillover has a meaningful influence on compensation contracting.<sep>Abstract Using a panel of approximately 1670 US technology‐intensive supplier firms during the period 2001–2013, we find that the number and value of new products of a supplier firm are positively related to technology spillover it receives from its supply chain partners (i.e., buyer firms). However, this positive relation is negatively related to customer concentration, which may be attributed to the supplier firm's narrowed technology search scope. Our empirical evidence suggests that although a supplier firm may benefit from a “learning by supplying” relation in a supply chain, it is also subject to a “locked‐in” issue. On the other hand, we also find that the number and value of new brands of a supplier firm are negatively related to technology spillover when it relies on a more concentrated group of customers.<sep>This study examines whether and how financial statement comparability facilitates the dissemination of innovative knowledge between firms and stimulates the creation of new knowledge. Using cross-patent citations to track interfirm knowledge transfers, we find that comparability increases firms' incentives to learn from peers and create new patents that cite their peers' existing patents. The investigation into the mechanism reveals that comparability improves firms’ ability to estimate the monetary value of peer knowledge and predict their own financial benefits from knowledge acquisition. The impact of comparability is more pronounced when peer knowledge is more publicly accessible or of higher monetary value. Consequently, the acquired knowledge fosters follow-on innovation, enabling firms to produce more patents with greater economic significance. Evidence from two quasi-natural experiments suggests that our findings are plausibly causal. Overall, our study highlights the important role of accounting comparability in facilitating knowledge dissemination.<sep>This paper provides empirical evidence for the role of technology spillover, an important innovation externality, in asset pricing. Using patent and R&D data, I show that firms with more technology spillover earn 7.7% higher annualized returns than firms with less technology spillover. Exploiting three quasi-natural experiments, I find that the return effect is strengthened (attenuated) when there is a plausibly exogenous increase (decrease) in the flow of technological information across firms. I also find that firms with more technology spillover have higher cash flow sensitivity to aggregate consumption, numbers of new products, and stock return synchronicity. These findings are consistent with models on learning about new technology; specifically, spillover enables learning about new technology to facilitate timely and large-scale adoption of new technology, which in turn exposes spillover recipients to additional systematic risk. These findings highlight the influence of innovation externality on stock returns.<sep>In this paper, we empirically examine how the strengthened legal protection of novel designs prevents mimicking behaviors and thus enhances the economic value of novel designs and their assignees. We use the decision of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Egyptian Goddess, Inc. v. Swisa, Inc. as an unexpected regulation change that prevented accused infringers from using the “point-of-novelty” test to defend themselves, which enhanced the protection of design patents, especially intricate ones. After this decision, we show that intricate designs are better protected than simple designs and are less mimicked by subsequent designs. Moreover, we show that stock market reactions to grants of intricate design patents are significantly more positive than reactions to grants of simple design patents after this decision. Finally, we show that such positive reactions are more pronounced among firms facing fiercer product market competition and among firms previously involved in design patent litigation.<sep>We analyze, theoretically and empirically, the implications of salience on innovation announcements in the biopharmaceutical industry. We hypothesize that equity market investors are more likely to pay attention to an innovation announcement that is more salient: thus, investors pay more attention to FDA drug approvals of pharmaceuticals compared to that paid to patent grant announcements of the same molecule. Based on this assumption, we develop a dynamic model with limited investor attention of patent grant and FDA drug approval announcements in the biopharmaceutical industry. We show that, in addition to an announcement effect, there will be a stock return drift following innovation announcements, with the magnitude of the former increasing and the latter decreasing in investor attention. We test model predictions using a matched sample of biopharmaceutical industry patent grant announcements and subsequent FDA drug approval announcements of the same molecule. Our empirical results are consistent with our model predictions.<sep>ABSTRACT Bolton, Scheinkman, and Xiong (2006) model a setting where investors disagree and short‐sales constraints cause pessimistic views of stock prices to be less influential, which leads to speculative stock prices. A theoretical implication of the model is that existing shareholders can exploit the speculative stock prices by (i) designing managerial compensation contracts that encourage short‐term performance, and (ii) subsequently selling their shares to more optimistic investors. We document empirical support for this theory by finding that an exogenous removal (Regulation SHO) of short‐sales constraints curbs the provision of short‐term incentives, an effect reflected in longer CEO compensation duration. The effect is concentrated among stocks with high investor disagreement and short‐term‐oriented institutional ownership. Consistent with prior work, we also find that longer CEO compensation duration leads to longer CEO investment horizons, less overinvestment, and less earnings management. Collectively, our results speak to the contributing role of speculative stock prices in corporate short‐termism. Finally, our study implies that effective policies to curb corporate short‐termism should address stock market speculation and promote mechanisms that tie executive compensation to longer‐term stock price performance.<sep>Purpose With the ongoing industrial transformation of the Japanese sake industry and the continuous growth of exports in recent years, terroir, one of the core concepts in the wine culture, has been strategically used in the sake industry. Therefore, as an essential investigation, the purpose of this study is to elucidate when, how and why terroir has been used in the sake industry. This study starts with the research question: When, how and why has terroir come to be used strategically in the sake industry? Design/methodology/approach This study investigates the use of terroir in the Japanese sake industry, examining all 196 newspapers that referenced terroir from 1998 to 2022, sourced from the renowned newspaper database Nikkei Telecom 21. This study’s outcomes have been visualized through categorization work and text mining. Findings In this study, the use of terroir in the Japanese sake industry has gained significant momentum since 2015, with a remarkable surge observed in the 2020s. With the continuous growth in sake exports, industry players such as sake brewers are strategically structuring terroir to reinforce the authenticity of the brewing process, emphasizing the uniqueness of natural elements, such as water, sake rice and the natural environment. These findings highlight the critical role of terroir in the Japanese sake industry’s added value expansion. Originality/value This study provides objective insights regarding the recent industrial transformation for the practical sake industry, such as sake exporters and distributors. Additionally, this study enables the wine industry’s audience to understand the sake industry’s evolution in terms of wine culture.<sep>We analyze, theoretically and empirically, the effect of investor attention on the stock market reaction to innovation announcements and suggest how market-based measures of the economic value of patents can be enhanced. We develop a model with limited investor attention to show that, in addition to the immediate market reaction to innovation announcements, there will also be a stock return drift following the announcement. Further, the magnitude of the announcement effect will be increasing while that of the post-announcement drift will be decreasing in investor attention. We test our model predictions using a large sample of patent grant announcements from the USPTO. We use the media coverage of patent grant announcements and abnormal Google search volume around these announcements as proxies for the investor attention paid to them. Consistent with model predictions, we find the following. First, the announcement effect of patent grant announcements is increasing in investor attention while the subsequent stock return drift is decreasing in investor attention. We use an IV analysis (with industry average investor attention one year prior to innovation announcements as the instrument) to show that the above results are not driven by endogeneity. Second, the stock-return drift following patent grant announcements has predictive power for the economic value of patents, over and above the information contained in their announcement effects. Third, we construct a new measure for the economic value of an innovation by incorporating investor attention from before to after a patent grant announcement and show that this measure has greater predictive power for the future economic performance of the patent-holding firm than the announcement effect alone. Finally, we show that a long-short trading strategy based on investor attention is profitable over the one-month period after patent grant announcements.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/238120/professor-associate-assistant-professor-in-accounting/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5024071114", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5025831008", "response": "Comparison: Candidate B demonstrates a broader and more relevant research focus on topics such as corporate governance, financial reporting, and innovation, which aligns closely with the job description's emphasis on areas like corporate governance, financial accounting, and risk management.

In doing so, it fills a significant gap in the already sizeable body of non-representational discourse.<sep>This piece serves as an interlude – a point of departure and an opportunity to reflect on the practice of sound making. Based on a short film which was screened at the Geography, Space, Music Conference at Durham University in 2018, the writing is organised around five quotations from Erin Manning’s (2016) The Minor Gesture which serve as thematic provocations for the insights offered. The five themes taken up by the author are: Affirmation, Experimentation, Vibration, Elasticity and Gesture.<sep>Abstract In this chapter, Boyd describes the staging and evaluation of the ‘Finding Home’ exhibition within the context of university ‘impact agendas’. The notion of societal impact is critiqued before the tasks involved in staging the ‘Finding Home’ exhibition are detailed. The findings from the exhibition’s evaluation, which included 100 visitor surveys and 31 phone interviews with exhibition audiences, are also presented in this chapter. The chapter concludes with reflections on the labour involved in bringing a research exhibition to multiple publics.<sep>Abstract In this chapter, Boyd summarises the Engaging Youth in Regional Australia (EYRA) Study whose findings formed the basis of the touring art exhibition called ‘Finding Home’. Rooted in placed-based understandings of youth belonging and well-being, the study sought to challenge some of the long-standing assumptions about young people’s internal migration decisions in regional Australia. Specifically, the study’s findings support an enhanced understanding of regional youth engagement that takes into account the affective and material dimensions of young people’s relationships with regional places.<sep>In this chapter, the practices of a General Assembly of Interested Parties (GAIP; Melbourne-based performance group) are presented through images of participating artists and a ‘gentle description’ oriented towards seven themes within non-representational theory: Sense, Movement, Relation, Self, Memory, Affect, and Experiment. The intention is not to treat these practices reductively but to highlight the ways in which an attunement to the non-representational is at the heart of the work. The chapter is infused throughout with references to philosophical thought that go only part way to elucidating what is intuitively felt and realised by performers through creative acts of improvisation.<sep>Abstract After considering the nature and role of creative co-production in research contexts, Boyd describes the processes involved in producing artworks for the ‘Finding Home’ exhibition based on research findings from the Engaging Youth in Regional Australia (EYRA) Study. Commencing with work produced by some of the study’s participants, Boyd moves on to discuss the commissioning of a set of textile works and a contemporary Aboriginal artwork for the exhibition. The chapter is interwoven with a description of Boyd’s own artworks as an artist-geographer, produced in response but also in sympathy with the rest of the exhibition as it emerged. The chapter concludes with some first-hand reflections on curating a research exhibition.<sep>The American Psychological Association defines ‘climate anxiety’ or ‘eco-anxiety’ as a chronic fear of environmental doom (Clayton et al., 2017, p.68 [Glossary]). This paper instead theorises climate anxiety as an emergent form of posthuman knowledge, albeit one that is dominated by vulnerability rather than affirmation. Put this way, the cultivation of ethical relationality through meaningful multi-species encounters holds potential for transforming this vulnerability and alleviating the anxiety. Offering both a reappraisal of early earth-writing by humanistic geographers and an engagement with recent work on ‘earth emotions’, including notions of ‘ecological grief’ and ‘mourning’, the article critically reviews lines of thinking – together constituting a new form of posthuman wellbeing studies – that challenge clinical understandings of climate anxiety by reimagining the purpose and mode of psychological intervention for the futures of earthly wellbeing.<sep>‘Art’ and ‘memory’ are prominent areas of inquiry in geographical research. Artistic and memory work often overlap in our studies through practices and processes aimed at bringing people together in experimental, affective, and collective ways. In this introduction to the special issue, we write collectively as 12 authors to reflect on the histories, inspirations, and future trajectories of these intersecting concerns in geographical research. Our reflections stem from our collective participation and discussions of issues at the intersections of art, memory and geographical research, during an online workshop and our individual-and-collective reflections later through the process of writing this piece. We hope our discussions further interest on the possibilities for creative, collaborative, and decolonial interventions to memory in geography. And, incidentally, we hope that our editorial may be of interest for future research into the value and practices of collective geographic scholarship.<sep>Context: The objective of this commentary is to suggest ways in which current and future research on climate change and rural mental health can be enhanced by social geographic perspectives. As the effects of climate change escalate, the mental health of rural and remote communities will be placed at increasing risk. As such, it is imperative that academics and practitioners recognise the value of multidisciplinary approaches to tackling this issue. Issues: As social geographers, the authors of this commentary outline concepts from their field that they find helpful in understanding the relationship between people and places, and how these relations give rise to emotions that are responsive to environmental conditions. Lessons learned: Ultimately, the authors would like to prompt a re-thinking of ‘social’ as a category, which is usually confined to interpersonal interactions between humans and suggest a broadening of the concept to include both human and non-human worlds.<sep>In a world of colour, monochrome images break through the monotony of visual saturation, creating a sense of nostalgia in the present. As an aesthetic rooted in the past, black and white photography when applied to the present lends an authority to images by visually coding them as archival. Drawing on photographs taken by young people as part of a broader research project, this short article will explore the tendency of monochrome to elicit geographies of memory by charging them with productive nostalgia. The study, called Engaging Youth in Regional Australia and partly undertaken in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, sought to better understand the connections that regional Australian youth have with their hometowns, and, in turn, how this relates to their decisions to stay, leave, or return to a regional area. Although not explicitly asked to do so, some of these young people responded to the use of black and white film by connecting place to childhood memory. This short article considers the implications of this tendency for art as research in human geography.<sep>There is a long history of collaboration between artists and geographers, with creative forms of research and dissemination of findings taking shape as artworks. In addition, there has been significant push from academia for researchers to maximise their research in ways that cater to, and engage with, broader public audiences. Art and creative practices tap into this through formats such as exhibitions, performances and participatory workshops which draw upon arts-based research methodologies with which geographers are becoming increasingly engaged. However, with this enthusiasm to adopt art practices for research dissemination purposes, tensions can arise in determining the levels of collaboration and authorship between artists and geographers, especially when the artist is employed as a research assistant on the project. In this ‘In Practice’ article, we explore the tensions and challenges that creative collaborations produce with respect to copyright and authorship, specialist skills and the delicate balance of doing creative research as part of a research team. We argue that geographers and artists need to address these issues from the outset and revisit them throughout the research process, and we offer some suggestions for how art–geography research collaborations might best be negotiated.<sep>Climate change anxiety is a growing problem for individual well-being the world over. However, psychological interventions to address climate change anxiety may have unintended effects on outcomes other than individual well-being, such as group cohesion and pro-environmental behavior. In order to address these complexities, we outline a multiple needs framework of climate change anxiety interventions, which can be used to analyze interventions in terms of their effects on individual, social, and environmental outcomes. We use this framework to contextualize a systematic review of the literature detailing the effects of climate change anxiety interventions. This analysis identifies interventions centered around problem-focused action, emotion management, and enhancing social connections as those which have beneficial effects on the widest range of outcomes. It also identifies interventions that may have detrimental effects on one or more outcomes. We identify gaps where more research is required, including research that assesses the effects of climate change anxiety interventions on individual, social, and environmental outcomes in concert. An interactive website summarizes these insights and presents the results of the systematic review in a way that is accessible to a range of stakeholders. The multiple needs framework provides a way to conceptualize the effectiveness of climate change anxiety interventions beyond their impact on individual well-being, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the effects of this global phenomenon.<sep>Climate change anxiety is a growing problem for individual well-being the world over.

As such, our focus is not only on why young people choose to leave their hometowns but also why some choose to stay. By paying attention to young people’s experiences of being away, we also shed light on why some young people choose to return to regional areas having left for a time. In emphasising the affective, material, and embodied dimensions of these experiences, the affordances of rural and urban places are also brought to light. Fifty young people aged between 18 and 34 years from three regional Australian towns took part in the study by participating in semi‐structured interviews. Qualitative findings indicate that the internal migration decisions of these regional young people were predominantly affective. We demonstrate how bodies were affected by the particularities of place – including materialities and relations with human and non‐humans – that worked to connect or unify bodies, evoking feelings of inclusion and security. We discuss how the affective atmospheres of places pushed into and onto bodies, making them feel dislocated or oppressed, and the way that places worked to push bodies out through the embodied experience of difference. The participants in our study emphasised the dilemma of these affective pushes and pulls, where feelings of belonging, or longing for home or country had to be negotiated, reconsidered, and re‐worked in relation to the unfolding of place.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/49567/professor-in-english-literature/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5038406883", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5019320603", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on astrophysics and cosmology, which is not aligned with the English Literature professorship, whereas Candidate B's work in geography, arts, and collective memory, though not directly in English Literature, shows a stronger thematic and methodological overlap with the humanities and creative arts, which could be more adaptable to the role.\nPreferred: B\nConfidence score: 100", "created": 1737539720, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 78, "prompt_tokens": 10835, "total_tokens": 10913, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 10771}, "comparison": "Candidate A's research focuses on astrophysics and cosmology, which is not aligned with the English Literature professorship, whereas Candidate B's work in geography, arts, and collective memory, though not directly in English Literature, shows a stronger thematic and methodological overlap with the humanities and creative arts, which could be more adaptable to the role.", "preferred": "B", "confidence_score": 100, "passage_rank1": 53, "passage_rank2": 90}

The developed method makes use of a machine learning based Gaussian process regression (GPR) technique as a modeling framework, while a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) chart is applied to detect PV system faults. The developed GPR-based GLRT approach is assessed using simulated and real PV data through monitoring the key PV system variables (current, voltage, and power). The computation time, missed detection rate (MDR), and false alarm rate (FAR) are computed to evaluate the fault detection performance of the proposed approach.<sep>In this paper, an improved fault detection method is proposed based on kernel partial least squares (KPLS) model and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detection chart in order to enhance the monitoring abilities of nonlinear chemical processes. To deal with both high computational cost for large data set and time-varying dynamics of industrial processes, the proposed method is used to select a reduced set of kernel functions to build the KPLS model and applies it for online fault detection based on GLRT chart. Comparing with the conventional KPLS technique, the proposed method has the advantages of improving the computation efficiency by decreasing the dimension of kernel matrix. The developed online reduced KPLS-based GLRT (OR-GLRT) could improve the fault detection efficiency since it is able to track the time-varying characteristics of the processes. The fault detection performance of the developed OR-GLRT method is evaluated using a Tennessee Eastman process. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional GLRT technique.<sep>This paper proposes a new leak/contaminant detection approach that aims to enhance the monitoring of water distribution network (WDN). The developed method relies on using machine learning (e.g Gaussian process regression (GPR)) as a modeling framework and generalized likelihood ratio (GLRT) for detection purposes. To improve the performances of the developed GPR model even further, multiscale representation of data will be used to develop multiscale extension of these method. Multiscale representation is a powerful data analysis technique that presents efficient separation of deterministic characteristics from random noise. Therefore, the multiscale GPR method, that combines the advantages of the GPR method with those of multiscale representation, will be developed to enhance the WDN modeling performance. We develop a new technique for detecting leak/contaminant in WDN using GLRT. For further enhance, the performance of GLRT, an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)-GLRT (EWMA-GLRT) chart is developed. The simulation results show that the MSGPR-based EWMA-GLRT method outperforms MSGPR-based GLRT and that both of them provide clear advantages over the neural networks (NN)- and support vector regression (SVR)- and GPR-based GLRT techniques.<sep>This paper proposes a new contaminant detection and water quality monitoring approach. Firstly, we propose an enhanced water quality modeling technique based on machine learning (e.g Gaussian process regression (GPR)) that aims at improving the proper understanding of the behavior of water distribution systems. To improve the performances of the developed water quality model even further, multiscale representation of data will be used to develop multiscale extension of these method. Multiscale representation is a powerful data analysis way that presents efficient separation of deterministic characteristics from random noise. Thus, multiscale GPR method, that combines the advantages of the machine learning method with those of multiscale representation, will be developed to enhance the water quality modeling performance. Secondly, technique to detect contaminant in WDN using hypothesis testing chart will be developed. Generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) has shown a good detection performances when compared to the classical detection charts. Then, to further enhance the performance of contaminant detection, a multiscale GPR-based exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) GLRT (EWMA-GLRT) chart is developed. Therefore, this paper aims at enhancing the performances of contaminant monitoring using multiscale GPR-based GLRT and MSGPR-based EWMA-GLRT approaches.<sep>This paper elaborates the development of machine learning approach merged with statistical hypothesis testing aimed at enhancing the operation of photovoltaic (PV) systems by developing intelligent PV fault detection framework. Fault detection in PV systems is important to ensure optimal energy harvesting and reliable power production because PV systems usually operate in a harsh outdoor environment and tend to suffer various faults. In this paper, therefore, special attention is paid to detection of various faults during different modes of operation. The proposed approach merges the benefits of machine learning technique (MLT) with statistical hypothesis testing to enhance the fault detection and monitoring of PV systems. The proposed technique will be effective in monitoring the PV faults under both normal and abnormal conditions. For the framework developed, the modeling phase is addressed using MLT and the faults are detected using the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) chart. The MLT is used to compute the residuals monitored and the GLRT chart is applied to the monitored residuals evaluated for fault detection purposes. The developed MLT-based GLRT algorithm is implemented and validated using both simulated and real PV data. The results are evaluated in terms of false alarm rates (FAR), missed detection rates (MDR) and computation time.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Transfer of learning<sep>Hyperparameter<sep>Air conditioning<sep>Testbed<sep>Mean squared error<sep>Smart grid<sep>Tree (set theory)<sep>Mean absolute percentage error<sep>Outlier<sep>Multiprocessing<sep>Occupancy<sep>Focus (optics)<sep>Scalability<sep>Software deployment<sep>Thread (computing)<sep>Deep learning<sep>Solar energy<sep>Artificial neural network<sep>Cluster analysis<sep>HVAC<sep>Electricity<sep>Resource allocation<sep>Energy (signal processing)<sep>Key (lock)<sep>Architecture<sep>Edge computing<sep>Computational fluid dynamics<sep>Convolutional neural network<sep>Thermal comfort<sep>Adaptability<sep>Building energy simulation<sep>Computation<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Overfitting<sep>Reinforcement learning<sep>Function (biology)<sep>Wireless sensor network<sep>Scheduling (production processes)<sep>Benchmark (surveying)<sep>Building automation<sep>Photovoltaic system<sep>Cloud computing<sep>Big data<sep>Demand response<sep>Transformer<sep>Efficient energy use<sep>Energy consumption<sep>Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution</keyword><title>Performance Evaluation of Tree-based Models for Big Data Load Forecasting using Randomized Hyperparameter Tuning<sep>Adaptive and Intelligent Edge Computing Based Building Energy Management System<sep>A Novel Optimal Wireless Thermal Sensor Placement Approach for Large Commercial Buildings<sep>Data Driven DRL Model For Home-Energy Control<sep>Edge-Based Real-Time Occupancy Detection System through a Non-Intrusive Sensing System<sep>Enhancing Building Energy Management: Adaptive Edge Computing for Optimized Efficiency and Inhabitant Comfort<sep>Toward Sustainable Manufacturing Facilities: Utilization of Solar Energy for Efficient Scheduling of Manufacturing Processes<sep>Inductive Transfer and Deep Neural Network Learning-Based Cross-Model Method for Short-Term Load Forecasting in Smarts Grids<sep>A Multiprocessing-Based Sensitivity Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Load Forecasting of Electric Power Distribution System<sep>Investigation on Optimizing Cost Function to Penalize Underestimation of Load Demand through Deep Learning Modeling<sep>An Improved Distributed Computing Time-Series Short-term Load Forecasting Pipeline for MV Transmission Planning<sep>REED: Enhanced Resource Allocation and Energy Management in SDN-Enabled Edge Computing-Based Smart Buildings<sep>Deep Learning-Based Short-Term Load Forecasting Approach in Smart Grid With Clustering and Consumption Pattern Recognition<sep>Predictive Modeling for Rooftop Solar Energy Throughput: A Machine Learning-Based Optimization for Building Energy Demand Scheduling</title><abstract>In this paper machine learning (ML) models have been developed for the application of big data load forecasting using parallel computation. The load forecasting models' performance is directly linked to system execution capacity, memory, thread count, balancing the load, and available resources. This paper is focused on two main challenges. The first challenge is to reduce the execution time of the ML models and the second one is to choose the suitable tree-based model for effective load forecasting. The paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the load forecasting using real-world data on energy consumption. Comprehensive results are obtained to show that the performance of random search to tune the ML models exhibits competitive performances whilst not losing the accuracy of the models and gaining a competitive advantage on the run time.<sep>Most building and energy management system (BEMS) solutions follow a set of rules (supervised or unsupervised learning) to make energy-saving recommendations to inhabitants. However, these systems are normally solely trained on energy data meaning that they do not consider other key factors, such as the inhabitants’ comfort or preferences. The lack of adaption to inhabitants renders these energy-saving solutions largely ineffective. Moreover, BEMS solutions are cloud-based entailing greater cyberattack risks and a high data transmission load. To address these problems, this research proposes an edge computing architecture based on virtual organizations and distributed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms for optimized energy use in buildings/homes and demand response. Thanks to virtual organizations’ energy efficiency (EE) measures, which consider the inhabitants’ comfort and dynamically learn from real-time inhabitant data, the consumption patterns of the inhabitants are effectively optimized.<sep>The widespread use of IoT devices and advances in communication technology have led to rapid development in building management systems. Considered one of the heaviest loads in commercial buildings, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) has been the focus of numerous studies. This paper proposes a novel approach to provide the optimal thermal sensor location for a large commercial building. The approach combines Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), network coverage, and clustering to establish a multi-step flow leading to the discovery of the optimal placements within the area of interest. The simulation results show that the combination of CFD and clustering can be very effective to identify potential candidates, which is then tuned using the coverage area of the network. Multiple scenarios were considered to simulate several environmental conditions, each of which leads to a different set of locations.<sep>Energy has always been a significant expense in both residential and commercial buildings and improving energy efficiency has long been an immanent way to control costs. Buildings are one of the major contributors to energy consumption in cities, with Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems accounting for around 60% of a building's total energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a data-driven paradigm that leverages a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model, in order to automate the operations of a HVAC system inside a residential building while balancing between thermal comfort and energy use. For this purpose, a custom environment has been developed, in which the proposed DRL should operate, and then the performance has been evaluated through multiples simulations using various learning methods. The Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) technique is one of the deployed algorithms that has shown promising results in terms of acceptable thermal comfort levels and energy savings.<sep>Building automation and the advancement of sustainability and safety in internal spaces benefit significantly from occupancy sensing. While particular traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods have succeeded at identifying occupancy patterns for specific datasets, achieving substantial performance in other datasets is still challenging. This paper proposes an occupancy detection method using non-intrusive ambient data and a Deep Learning (DL) model. An environmental sensing board was used to gather temperature, humidity, pressure, light level, motion, sound, and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) data. The detection approach was deployed on an edge device to enable low-cost computing while increasing data security. The system was set up at a university office, which functioned as the primary case study testing location. We analyzed two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to confirm the optimum alternative for edge deployment. A 2D-CNN technique was used for one day to identify occupancy in real-time. The model proved robust and reliable, with a 99.75% real-time prediction accuracy.<sep>Nowadays, in contemporary building and energy management systems (BEMSs), the predominant approach involves rule-based methodologies, typically employing supervised or unsupervised learning, to deliver energy-saving recommendations to building occupants. However, these BEMSs often suffer from a critical limitation—they are primarily trained on building energy data alone, disregarding crucial elements such as occupant comfort and preferences. This inherent lack of adaptability to occupants significantly hampers the effectiveness of energy-saving solutions. Moreover, the prevalent cloud-based nature of these systems introduces elevated cybersecurity risks and substantial data transmission overheads. In response to these challenges, this article introduces a cutting-edge edge computing architecture grounded in virtual organizations, federated learning, and deep reinforcement learning algorithms, tailored to optimize energy consumption within buildings/homes and facilitate demand response. By integrating energy efficiency measures within virtual organizations, which dynamically learn from real-time inhabitant data while prioritizing comfort, our approach effectively optimizes inhabitant consumption patterns, ushering in a new era of energy efficiency in the built environment.<sep>Abstract The utilization of solar energy as a renewable energy source has been a subject of interest for researchers in recent years. Despite recent advances in promoting solar energy, its intermittent and unpredictable nature limits its widespread utilization in manufacturing facilities. This research paper focuses on utilizing solar energy for efficient scheduling of manufacturing processes while keeping friendly environmental conditions for the workers. The work proposes an energy-aware dynamic scheduling procedure to minimize production and building costs by optimizing the utilization of an onsite photovoltaic (PV) system energy generation. The proposed method considers various factors such as the availability of solar energy, energy consumption of different manufacturing processes, and thermal requirements of the building. A stochastic energy prediction algorithm is developed to forecast the hourly one-day-ahead solar resources based on year-long solar radiation observations collected from an outdoor solar test facility in Qatar. This study shows that using the forecasted PV output improves the overall efficiency of manufacturing processes and building thermal requirements, thus achieving up to a 20% reduction in energy costs. These findings help the development of sustainable manufacturing systems and decrease the negative environmental impacts from industries.<sep>In a real-world scenario of load forecasting, it is crucial to determine the energy consumption in electrical networks. The energy consumption data exhibit high variability between historical data and newly arriving data streams. To keep the forecasting models updated with the current trends, it is important to fine-tune the models in a timely manner. This article proposes a reliable inductive transfer learning (ITL) method, to use the knowledge from existing deep learning (DL) load forecasting models, to innovatively develop highly accurate ITL models at a large number of other distribution nodes reducing model training time. The outlier-insensitive clustering-based technique is adopted to group similar distribution nodes into clusters. ITL is considered in the setting of homogeneous inductive transfer. To solve overfitting that exists with ITL, a novel weight regularized optimization approach is implemented. The proposed novel cross-model methodology is evaluated on a real-world case study of 1000 distribution nodes of an electrical grid for one-day ahead hourly forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that overfitting and negative learning in ITL can be avoided by the dissociated weight regularization (DWR) optimizer and that the proposed methodology delivers a reduction in training time by almost 85.6% and has no noticeable accuracy losses.<sep>For the utility to plan the resources accurately and balance the electricity supply and demand, accurate and timely forecasting is required. The proliferation of smart meters in the grids has resulted in an explosion of energy datasets. Processing such data is challenging and usually takes a longer time than the requirement of a short-term load forecast. The paper addresses this concern by utilizing parallel computing capabilities to minimize the execution time while maintaining highly accurate load forecasting models. In this paper, a thousand smart meter energy datasets are analyzed to perform day ahead, hourly short-term load forecast (STLF). The paper utilizes multi-processing to enhance the overall execution time of the forecasting models by submitting simultaneous jobs to all the processors available. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach through the choice of machine learning (ML) models, execution time, and scalability. The proposed approach is validated on real energy consumption data collected at distribution transformers' level in Spanish Electrical Grid. Decision trees have outperformed the other models accomplishing a tradeoff between model accuracy and execution time. The methodology takes only 4 minutes to train 1,000 transformers for an hourly day-ahead forecast of (~24 million records) utilizing 32 processors.<sep>Quadratic cost function such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) has been a widely used objective function for training deep neural networks to develop energy forecasting models in Smart Grids. In this work, Penalizing Underestimation Logarithmic Squared Error (PULSE), a novel objective function is proposed with the aim of reducing the tendency of deep learning models to underestimate the target variable. Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are adopted on the time series load demand data to investigate the performance of the proposed cost function against the widely used MSE cost function. The evaluation is performed using open-source real-world electricity load diagrams dataset covering a period of three years. The performance of the proposed scheme is examined with deep learning models through several experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to eliminate the tendency to underestimate and provides competitively accurate load demand forecasting results. The results are additionally compared against the state-of-the-art machine learning models developed in the literature. The proposed cost function maintains the RMSE around 4*10 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup> kWh which is also the RMSE for deep learning models with MSE cost function and delivers 25% improvement in MAPE while also eliminating the underestimation of load demand.<sep>Planning, maintenance, and power flow analysis of modern power systems generally require the application of load prediction as a critical component. This paper presents a general, scalable, end-to-end big data pipeline, that uses the strong correlation between energy consumption, date and time information, and weather data for 24-hour-ahead load forecasting. The suggested approach is validated using actual energy usage data gathered from more than 100,000 distribution transformers in the Spanish electrical smart grid and implemented seamlessly using the parallelization capacity of distributed computing cluster leading to a dramatic decrease in the execution time. This paper introduces the following interesting findings: i) in the context of big data where hundreds of thousands of distribution transformers data exist, load forecasting at aggregated level can be done using linear regression models where more than 85% of the total energy consumption, across all distribution transformers in Spain, is forecasted with an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}\\geq 70\\%$</tex> . ii) slicing the data into <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{24}$</tex> pieces to develop a forecasting model for each hour and connect these models together to reflect the inter-hours correlation is better than building one regression model for all 24 hours together. iii) computation cost and time are the most important driving factor in choosing the best regression model in short-term load forecasting at the aggregation and production levels.<sep>The number of applications of internet of things (IoT) devices in smart buildings keeps growing continuously, and with it, the computational tasks rendered by those devices. In smart buildings, IoT devices generate massive data traffic, and the number of devices and traffic volume increases exponentially. This issue is more sensitive in smart buildings as the management of their data is critical. Therefore, matching the task’s differential needs (e.g., energy, delay) with the network resources is paramount. In a device-to-device (D2D) aided edge computing (EC) architecture, tasks can be offloaded to the resource-rich IoT device or edge node to improve offloading efficiency and minimize energy consumption and delay. Exploiting these benefits, in this paper, we propose enhanced resource allocation and energy management in smart buildings enabled by software-defined networking and EC, as well as D2D aided end-to-end communications (REED). REED aims to minimize energy consumption and delay in a smart building by jointly optimizing resource allocation and offloading decisions. To find the near-optimal solution, we use the model-free deep reinforcement learning, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, because the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem with a large dimensional continuous state and action spaces in a dynamic environment. Simulation results show that the intended REED model can perform better in terms of energy consumption and delay than the other benchmark approaches.<sep>Different aggregation levels of the electric grid’s big data can be helpful to develop highly accurate deep learning models for Short-term Load Forecasting (STLF) in electrical networks. Whilst different models are proposed for STLF, they are based on small historical datasets and are not scalable to process large amounts of big data as energy consumption data grow exponentially in large electric distribution networks. This paper proposes a novel hybrid clustering-based deep learning approach for STLF at the distribution transformers’ level with enhanced scalability. It investigates the gain in training time and the performance in terms of accuracy when clustering-based deep learning modeling is employed for STLF. A k-Medoid based algorithm is employed for clustering whereas the forecasting models are generated for different clusters of load profiles. The clustering of the distribution transformers is based on the similarity in energy consumption profile. This approach reduces the training time since it minimizes the number of models required for many distribution transformers. The developed deep neural network consists of six layers and employs Adam optimization using the TensorFlow framework. The STLF is a day-ahead hourly horizon forecasting. The accuracy of the proposed modeling is tested on a 1,000-transformer substation subset of the Spanish distribution electrical network data containing more than 24 million load records. The results reveal that the proposed model has superior performance when compared to the state-of-the-art STLF methodologies. The proposed approach delivers an improvement of around 44% in training time while maintaining accuracy using single-core processing as compared to non-clustering models.<sep>Abstract The intermittent and fluctuating nature of solar energy is the biggest challenge facing its widespread utilization. Implementing onsite photovoltaic (PV) systems as alternative energy sources has established the need for reliable forecasting procedures to improve scheduling and demand management. This paper presents solar energy forecasting combined with a demand-side prediction algorithm to optimize the utilization of available solar energy resources and manage the demand side accordingly. The algorithm utilizes support vector regression (SVR), a machine learning technique, validated using one-year energy consumption data collected from an office building instrumented as an experimental testbed facility. Power meters and temperature sensors collect the building’s internal climate and energy data, while a solar PV array and a weather station provide the external relevant data. The forecasting method uses the average power output of k-similar days as an added input to the SVR model to enhance its performance. The day-ahead prediction results show that this additional input contributes to higher forecasting efficiency, especially in the hot climate regions, where sunny weather conditions prevail throughout the year. The PV output prediction accuracy for sunny days is above 90%, which offers possibilities for optimized scheduling and leading to smart building energy management. Finally, this paper also proposes a temperature set point optimization algorithm for the building air conditioning system to minimize the difference between the building energy load and the generated solar PV power. Using 24 °C as the upper set point temperature limit reduces the energy demand (consumption) by up to 29% and the associated reduction in CO2 emissions.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/278066/assistant-professor-at-carnegie-mellon-university-cmkl-thailand-/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5042376197", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5038505208", "response": "Comparison: Candidate B demonstrates a stronger alignment with the job description, particularly in areas such as Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, High-performance Computing & Cloud Computing, and Data Science & Big Data Analytics, which are highlighted as strategic areas of interest.

We demonstrate that acute cold challenge elicits striking transcriptomic changes specifically within DPP4+ PDGFRβ+ adipocyte precursor cells, including a β-adrenergic receptor CREB-mediated induction in the expression of the prothermogenic cytokine, Il33 Doxycycline-inducible deletion of Il33 in PDGFRβ+ cells at the onset of cold exposure attenuates ILC2 accumulation and beige adipocyte accrual. These studies highlight the multifaceted roles for adipocyte progenitors and the ability of select mesenchymal subpopulations to relay neuronal signals to tissue-resident immune cells in order to regulate tissue plasticity.<sep>Adiponectin is essential for the regulation of tissue substrate utilization and systemic insulin sensitivity. Clinical studies have suggested a positive association of circulating adiponectin with healthspan and lifespan. However, the direct effects of adiponectin on promoting healthspan and lifespan remain unexplored. Here, we are using an adiponectin null mouse and a transgenic adiponectin overexpression model. We directly assessed the effects of circulating adiponectin on the aging process and found that adiponectin null mice display exacerbated age-related glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Moreover, adiponectin null mice have a significantly shortened lifespan on both chow and high-fat diet. In contrast, a transgenic mouse model with elevated circulating adiponectin levels has a dramatically improved systemic insulin sensitivity, reduced age-related tissue inflammation and fibrosis, and a prolonged healthspan and median lifespan. These results support a role of adiponectin as an essential regulator for healthspan and lifespan.<sep>Adipose precursor cells (APCs) exhibit regional variation in response to obesity, for unclear reasons. Here, we reveal that HIFα-induced PDGFRβ signaling within murine white adipose tissue (WAT) PDGFRβ+ cells drives inhibitory serine 112 (S112) phosphorylation of PPARγ, the master regulator of adipogenesis. Levels of PPARγ S112 phosphorylation in WAT PDGFRβ+ cells are depot dependent, with levels of PPARγ phosphorylation in PDGFRβ+ cells inversely correlating with their capacity for adipogenesis upon high-fat-diet feeding. HIFα suppression in PDGFRβ+ progenitors promotes subcutaneous and intra-abdominal adipogenesis, healthy WAT remodeling, and improved metabolic health in obesity. These metabolic benefits are mimicked by treatment of obese mice with the PDGFR antagonist Imatinib, which promotes adipocyte hyperplasia and glucose tolerance in a progenitor cell PPARγ-dependent manner. Our studies unveil a mechanism underlying depot-specific responses of APCs to high-fat feeding and highlight the potential for APCs to be targeted pharmacologically to improve metabolic health in obesity.<sep>Abstract Plasma hyaluronan (HA) increases systemically in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the HA synthesis inhibitor, 4-Methylumbelliferone, has been proposed to treat the disease. However, HA is also implicated in normal physiology. Therefore, we generated a Hyaluronan Synthase 2 transgenic mouse line, driven by a tet-response element promoter to understand the role of HA in systemic metabolism. To our surprise, adipocyte-specific overproduction of HA leads to smaller adipocytes and protects mice from high-fat-high-sucrose-diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. Adipocytes also have more free glycerol that can be released upon beta3 adrenergic stimulation. Improvements in glucose tolerance were not linked to increased plasma HA. Instead, an HA-driven systemic substrate redistribution and adipose tissue-liver crosstalk contributes to the systemic glucose improvements. In summary, we demonstrate an unexpected improvement in glucose metabolism as a consequence of HA overproduction in adipose tissue, which argues against the use of systemic HA synthesis inhibitors to treat obesity and T2D.<sep>Chronic low-grade white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome in obesity. Here, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of mouse WAT perivascular (PDGFRβ+) cells, termed fibro-inflammatory progenitors (FIPs), activate proinflammatory signalling cascades shortly after the onset of high-fat diet feeding and regulate proinflammatory macrophage accumulation in WAT in a TLR4-dependent manner. FIPs activation in obesity is mediated by the downregulation of zinc-finger protein 423 (ZFP423), identified here as a transcriptional corepressor of NF-κB. ZFP423 suppresses the DNA-binding capacity of the p65 subunit of NF-κB by inducing a p300-to-NuRD coregulator switch. Doxycycline-inducible expression of Zfp423 in PDGFRβ+ cells suppresses inflammatory signalling in FIPs and attenuates metabolic inflammation of visceral WAT in obesity. Inducible inactivation of Zfp423 in PDGFRβ+ cells increases FIP activity, exacerbates adipose macrophage accrual and promotes WAT dysfunction. These studies implicate perivascular mesenchymal cells as important regulators of chronic adipose-tissue inflammation in obesity and identify ZFP423 as a transcriptional break on NF-κB signalling.<sep>Energy-storing white adipocytes maintain their identity by suppressing the energy-burning thermogenic gene program of brown and beige adipocytes. Here, we reveal that the protein–protein interaction between the transcriptional coregulator ZFP423 and brown fat determination factor EBF2 is essential for restraining the thermogenic phenotype of white adipose tissue (WAT). Disruption of the ZFP423–EBF2 protein interaction through CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing triggers widespread “browning” of WAT in adult mice. Mechanistically, ZFP423 recruits the NuRD corepressor complex to EBF2-bound thermogenic gene enhancers. Loss of adipocyte Zfp423 induces an EBF2 NuRD-to-BAF coregulator switch and a shift in PPARγ occupancy to thermogenic genes. This shift in PPARγ occupancy increases the antidiabetic efficacy of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone in obesity while diminishing the unwanted weight-gaining effect of the drug. These data indicate that ZFP423 controls EBF2 coactivator recruitment and PPARγ occupancy to determine the thermogenic plasticity of adipocytes and highlight the potential of therapeutically targeting transcriptional brakes to induce beige adipocyte biogenesis in obesity.<sep>The molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-induced increases in β cell mass and the resulting β cell dysfunction need to be elucidated further. Our study revealed that GPR92, expressed in islet macrophages, is modulated by dietary interventions in metabolic tissues. Therefore, we aimed to define the role of GPR92 in islet inflammation by using a high-fat diet-induced (HFD-induced) obese mouse model. GPR92-KO mice exhibited glucose intolerance and reduced insulin levels - despite the enlarged pancreatic islets - as well as increased islet macrophage content and inflammation level compared with WT mice. These results indicate that the lack of GPR92 in islet macrophages can cause β cell dysfunction, leading to disrupted glucose homeostasis. Alternatively, stimulation with the GPR92 agonist farnesyl pyrophosphate results in the inhibition of HFD-induced islet inflammation and increased insulin secretion in WT mice, but not in GPR92-KO mice. Thus, our study suggests that GPR92 can be a potential target to alleviate β cell dysfunction via the inhibition of islet inflammation associated with the progression of diabetes.<sep>The manner in which white adipose tissue (WAT) expands and remodels directly impacts the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in obesity. Preferential accumulation of visceral WAT is associated with increased risk for insulin resistance, whereas subcutaneous WAT expansion is protective. Moreover, pathologic WAT remodeling, typically characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis, is associated with insulin resistance. Healthy WAT expansion, observed in the “metabolically healthy” obese, is generally associated with the presence of smaller and more numerous adipocytes, along with lower degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. Here, we highlight recent human and rodent studies that support the notion that the ability to recruit new fat cells through adipogenesis is a critical determinant of healthy adipose tissue distribution and remodeling in obesity. Furthermore, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the identity of tissue-resident progenitor populations in WAT made possible through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. A better understanding of adipose stem cell biology and adipogenesis may lead to novel strategies to uncouple obesity from metabolic disease.<sep>Dermal adipose tissue (also known as dermal white adipose tissue and herein referred to as dWAT) has been the focus of much discussion in recent years. However, dWAT remains poorly characterized. The fate of the mature dermal adipocytes and the origin of the rapidly reappearing dermal adipocytes at different stages remain unclear. Here, we isolated dermal adipocytes and characterized dermal fat at the cellular and molecular level. Together with dWAT’s dynamic responses to external stimuli, we established that dermal adipocytes are a distinct class of white adipocytes with high plasticity. By combining pulse-chase lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed that mature dermal adipocytes undergo dedifferentiation and redifferentiation under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Upon various challenges, the dedifferentiated cells proliferate and redifferentiate into adipocytes. In addition, manipulation of dWAT highlighted an important role for mature dermal adipocytes for hair cycling and wound healing. Altogether, these observations unravel a surprising plasticity of dermal adipocytes and provide an explanation for the dynamic changes in dWAT mass that occur under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and highlight the important contributions of dWAT toward maintaining skin homeostasis.<sep>SUMMARY G protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), a medium-chain fatty acid receptor, may be involved in various metabolic conditions but the mechanism remains unclear. We found that GPR84 is highly expressed and functions in brown adipose tissue (BAT). GPR84 knockout mice exhibited increased adiposity and vulnerability to cold exposure after aging, along with an increased BAT lipid content and decreased BAT activation compared to wild-type control mice. In vitro , primary brown adipocytes from GPR84 knockout mice showed reduced expression of thermogenic genes and lower O 2 consumption. The GPR84 agonist 6-OAU reversed these effects and restored brown adipocyte activation. In vivo and in vitro results showed that BAT defects in GPR84 knockout mice were attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction. GPR84 activation greatly affected intracellular calcium efflux, further influencing mitochondrial respiration. GPR84 activates BAT by controlling the mitochondrial calcium content and respiration, suggesting a therapeutic target for activating BAT and treating metabolic diseases. HIGHLIGHTS High expression of GPR84 in brown adipocytes is induced by cold stimulation. Aged GPR84 knockout mice exhibit brown adipose tissue defects under cold exposure. GPR84 knockout mice show reduced mitochondrial function of brown adipocytes. GPR84 activation improves brown adipocyte functions.<sep>The stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) of white adipose tissue (WAT) is remarkably heterogeneous and consists of numerous cell types that contribute functionally to the expansion and remodeling of WAT in adulthood. A tremendous barrier to studying the implications of this cellular heterogeneity is the inability to readily isolate functionally distinct cell subpopulations from WAT SVF for in vitro and in vivo analyses. Single-cell sequencing technology has recently identified functionally distinct fibro-inflammatory and adipogenic PDGFRβ+ perivascular cell subpopulations in intra-abdominal WAT depots of adult mice. Fibro-inflammatory progenitors (termed, “FIPs”) are non-adipogenic collagen producing cells that can exert a pro-inflammatory phenotype. PDGFRβ+ adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) are highly adipogenic both in vitro and in vivo upon cell transplantation. Here, we describe multiple methods for the isolation of these stromal cell subpopulations from murine intra-abdominal WAT depots. FIPs and APCs can be isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or by taking advantage of biotinylated antibody-based immunomagnetic bead technology. Isolated cells can be used for molecular and functional analysis. Studying the functional properties of stromal cell subpopulation in isolation will expand our current knowledge of adipose tissue remodeling under physiological or pathological conditions on the cellular level.<sep>Adult white adipose tissue (WAT) harbors distinct mesenchymal stromal cell subpopulations that differentially affect WAT function and plasticity. Here we unveil the cellular landscape of the perinatal epididymal WAT primordium using single-cell transcriptomics in male mice. We reveal that adipocyte precursor cells and fibro-inflammatory progenitors (FIPs) emerge as functionally distinct PDGFRβ+ subpopulations within the epididymal WAT anlagen prior to adipocyte accrual. We further identify important molecular and functional differences between perinatal and adult FIPs, including differences in their pro-inflammatory response, adipogenic capacity and anti-adipogenic behavior. Notably, we find that transient overexpression of Pparg in PDGFRβ+ cells only during postnatal days 0.5 to 7.5 in male mice leads to hyperplastic WAT development, durable progenitor cell reprogramming, and protection against pathologic WAT remodeling and glucose intolerance in adult-onset obesity. Thus, factors that alter the adipogenic capacity of perinatal adipose progenitors can have long-lasting effects on progenitor plasticity, tissue expandability and metabolic health into adulthood. Zhang et al. use single-cell transcriptomics to map the cellular landscape of perinatal murine epididymal adipose tissue, and demonstrate that altering the adipogenic capacity of perinatal adipose progenitors has long-term effects on progenitor plasticity, tissue expandability and metabolic health in adulthood.<sep>The G protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), a medium-chain fatty acid receptor, has garnered attention because of its potential involvement in a range of metabolic conditions. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Our study has shed light on the pivotal role of GPR84, revealing its robust expression and functional significance within the brown adipose tissue (BAT). Mice lacking GPR84 exhibited increased lipid accumulation in BAT, rendering them more susceptible to cold exposure, and displaying reduced BAT activity compared to their wild-type counterparts. Our in vitro experiments with primary brown adipocytes from GPR84 knockout mice revealed diminished expression of thermogenic genes and reduced O2 consumption. Furthermore, the application of the GPR84 agonist 6-OAU counteracted these effects, effectively reinstating the brown adipocyte activity. These compelling in vivo and in vitro findings converge to highlight mitochondrial dysfunction as the primary cause of BAT anomalies in GPR84 knockout mice. The activation of GPR84 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, which intricately influences mitochondrial respiration. By modulating mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and respiration, GPR84 has emerged as a potent molecule involved in BAT activity. These findings suggested that GPR84 is a potential therapeutic target for invigorating BAT and ameliorating metabolic disorders.<sep>Activated beige adipocytes have therapeutic potential due to their ability to improve glucose and lipid homeostasis. To date, the origin of beige adipocytes remains enigmatic. Whether beige cells arise through de novo differentiation from resident precursors or through reprogramming of mature white adipocytes has been a topic of intense discussion. Here, we offer our perspective on the natural origin of beige adipocytes in mice. In particular, we revisit recent lineage-tracing studies that shed light on this issue and offer new insight into how environmental housing temperatures early in life influence the mode of beige adipocyte biogenesis upon cold exposure later in life. We suggest a unified model in which beige adipocytes (UCP1+ multilocular cells) in rodents initially arise predominantly from progenitors (i.e., de novo beige adipogenesis) upon the first exposure to cold temperatures and then interconvert between “dormant beige” and “active beige” phenotypes (i.e., beige cell activation) upon subsequent changes in environmental temperature. Importantly, we highlight experimental considerations needed to visualize de novo adipogenesis versus beige cell activation in mice. A precise understanding of the cellular origins of beige adipocytes emanating in response to physiological and pharmacological stimuli may better inform therapeutic strategies to recruit beige adipocytes in vivo.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Internalization<sep>Observational study<sep>Juvenile<sep>Socioeconomic status<sep>Disease<sep>Interferon<sep>Lupus nephritis<sep>Secretion<sep>Scleroderma (fungus)<sep>Localized Scleroderma<sep>Discontinuation<sep>Rheumatology<sep>Dermatomyositis<sep>Social support<sep>Oligoarthritis<sep>Arthritis<sep>Severity of illness<sep>Erythropoiesis<sep>Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis<sep>Household income<sep>Antibody<sep>Ethnic group<sep>Cytokine<sep>Morphea<sep>Construct validity<sep>Systemic disease<sep>Prospective cohort study<sep>Interquartile range<sep>Odds ratio<sep>Inflammasome<sep>Methotrexate<sep>Rituximab<sep>Lactate dehydrogenase<sep>B cell<sep>Downregulation and upregulation<sep>Patient-reported outcome<sep>Juvenile dermatomyositis<sep>Mitochondrion<sep>Cohort<sep>Immunoglobulin D<sep>Rare disease</keyword><title>Erythroid mitochondrial retention triggers myeloid-dependent type I interferon in human SLE<sep>An unconventional mechanism of IL-1β secretion that requires Type I IFN in lupus monocytes<sep>Social determinants of health influence disease activity and functional disability in Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis<sep>Capturing the Range of Disease Involvement in Localized Scleroderma: The Localized scleroderma Total Severity Scale (LoTSS)<sep>Intraarticular steroids as DMARD-sparing agents for juvenile idiopathic arthritis flares: Analysis of the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance Registry<sep>Initial Results from a Pilot Comparative Effectiveness Study of 3 Methotrexate-based Consensus Treatment Plans for Juvenile Localized Scleroderma<sep>Disease Recapture Rates After Medication Discontinuation and Flare in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: An Observational Study Within the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance Registry<sep>Extracutaneous involvement is common and associated with prolonged disease activity and greater impact in juvenile localized scleroderma<sep><scp>Childhood‐Onset</scp> Lupus Nephritis in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance Registry: <scp>Short‐Term</scp> Kidney Status and Variation in Care<sep>Association of Juvenile Dermatomyositis Disease Activity With the Expansion of Blood Memory B and T Cell Subsets Lacking Follicular Markers<sep>Developing comparative effectiveness studies for a rare, understudied pediatric disease: lessons learned from the CARRA juvenile localized scleroderma consensus treatment plan pilot study<sep>Barriers to care in juvenile localized and systemic scleroderma: an exploratory survey study of caregivers’ perspectives</title><abstract>Emerging evidence supports that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. Here we show that programmed mitochondrial removal, a hallmark of mammalian erythropoiesis, is defective in SLE. Specifically, we demonstrate that during human erythroid cell maturation, a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated metabolic switch is responsible for the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which precedes and is necessary for the autophagic removal of mitochondria. A defect in this pathway leads to accumulation of red blood cells (RBCs) carrying mitochondria (Mito+ RBCs) in SLE patients and in correlation with disease activity. Antibody-mediated internalization of Mito+ RBCs induces type I interferon (IFN) production through activation of cGAS in macrophages. Accordingly, SLE patients carrying both Mito+ RBCs and opsonizing antibodies display the highest levels of blood IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signatures, a distinctive feature of SLE.<sep>Abstract Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by autoreactive B cell activation, upregulation of Type I Interferon (IFN) and widespread inflammation. Mitochondrial nucleic acids (NAs) are increasingly recognized as triggers of IFN 1 . Thus, defective removal of mitochondria from mature red blood cells (Mito + RBCs), a feature of SLE, contributes to IFN production by myeloid cells 2 . Here we identify blood monocytes (Mo) that have internalized RBCs and co-express IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in SLE patients with active disease. We show that ISG expression requires the interaction between Mito + RBC-derived mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and cGAS, while IL-1β production entails Mito + RBC-derived mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) triggering of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). This leads to the cytosolic release of Mo-derived mtDNA that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, IL-1β release depends on the IFN-inducible myxovirus resistant protein 1 (MxA), which enables the translocation of this cytokine into a trans-Golgi network (TGN)-mediated unconventional secretory pathway. Our study highlights a novel and synergistic pathway involving IFN and the NLRP3 inflammasome in SLE.<sep>Social determinants of health (SDH) greatly influence outcomes during the first year of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease similar to polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA). We investigated the correlation of community poverty level and other SDH with the persistence of moderate to severe disease activity and functional disability over the first year of treatment in pJIA patients enrolled in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance Registry.In this cohort study, unadjusted and adjusted generalized linear mixed effects models analyzed the effect of community poverty and other SDH on disease activity, using the clinical Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score-10, and disability, using the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire, measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months.One thousand six hundred eighty-four patients were identified. High community poverty (≥20% living below the federal poverty level) was associated with increased odds of functional disability (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.28-2.60) but was not statistically significant after adjustment (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 0.81-1.86) and was not associated with increased disease activity. Non-white race/ethnicity was associated with higher disease activity (aOR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.41-4.36). Lower self-reported household income was associated with higher disease activity and persistent functional disability. Public insurance (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06-2.29) and low family education (aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14-3.12) was associated with persistent functional disability.High community poverty level was associated with persistent functional disability in unadjusted analysis but not with persistent moderate to high disease activity. Race/ethnicity and other SDH were associated with persistent disease activity and functional disability.<sep>Juvenile localized scleroderma (jLS) is a chronic autoimmune disease commonly associated with poor outcome, including contractures, hemi‐atrophy, uveitis, and seizures. Despite improvements in treatment, &gt;25% of jLS patients have functional impairment. To improve patient evaluation, our workgroup developed Localized scleroderma Total Severity Scale (LoTSS), an overall disease severity measure. Method LoTSS was developed as a weighted measure by a consensus process involving literature review, surveys, case vignettes, and multi‐criteria decision analysis. Feasibility was assessed in larger Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance groups. Construct validity with physician assessment and inter‐rater reliability was assessed using case vignettes. Additional evaluation was performed in a prospective patient cohort initiating treatment. Results LoTSS severity items were organized into modules that reflect jLS disease patterns, with modules for skin, extracutaneous, and craniofacial manifestations. Construct validity of LoTSS was supported by a strong positive correlation with physician global assessment (PGA) of severity and damage, and weak positive correlation with PGA‐Activity, as expected. LoTSS was responsive, with a small effect size identified. Moderate to excellent inter‐rater reliability was demonstrated. LoTSS was able to discriminate between patient subsets, with higher scores identified in those with greater disease burden and functional limitation. Conclusion We developed a new LS measure for assessing cutaneous and extracutaneous severity, and have shown it to be reliable, valid, and responsive. LoTSS is the first measure that assesses and scores all the major extracutaneous manifestations in LS. Our findings suggest LoTSS could aid assessment and management of patients, and facilitate outcome evaluation in treatment studies. image<sep>Children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who achieve a drug free remission often experience a flare of their disease requiring either intraarticular steroids (IAS) or systemic treatment with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). IAS offer an opportunity to recapture disease control and avoid exposure to side effects from systemic immunosuppression. We examined a cohort of patients treated with IAS after drug free remission and report the probability of restarting systemic treatment within 12 months.We analyzed a cohort of patients from the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry who received IAS for a flare after a period of drug free remission. Historical factors and clinical characteristics and of the patients including data obtained at the time of treatment were analyzed.We identified 46 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Of those with follow up data available 49% had restarted systemic treatment 6 months after IAS injection and 70% had restarted systemic treatment at 12 months. The proportion of patients with prior use of a biologic DMARD was the only factor that differed between patients who restarted systemic treatment those who did not, both at 6 months (79% vs 35%, p < 0.01) and 12 months (81% vs 33%, p < 0.05).While IAS are an option for all patients who flare after drug free remission, it may not prevent the need to restart systemic treatment. Prior use of a biologic DMARD may predict lack of success for IAS. Those who previously received methotrexate only, on the other hand, are excellent candidates for IAS.<sep>Objective. To perform a comparative effectiveness feasibility study in juvenile localized scleroderma (LS), using standardized treatment regimens (consensus treatment plans; CTP). Methods. A prospective, multicenter 1-year pilot observational cohort study was performed by Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) LS workgroup members. Patients with active, moderate to severe juvenile LS were treated with one of 3 CTP: methotrexate alone, or in combination with intravenous (30 mg/kg/dose for 3 mos) or oral corticosteroids (2 mg/kg/day tapered by 48 weeks). Results. Fifty patients, with demographics typical for juvenile LS, were enrolled, and 44 (88%) completed the study. Most had extracutaneous involvement. Patients improved in all 3 CTP, with &gt; 75% having a major or moderate level of improvement compared to baseline. Damage accrued in some patients. Major deviations from prescribed regimen resulted from medication intolerance (n = 6; 14%) or treatment failure (n = 11; 25%); failures occurred in all 3 CTP. Significant responses to treatment were demonstrated by LS skin scoring measures and overall physician assessments, with differences in response level identified in some patient subsets. Response differences were associated with baseline disease activity level, LS subtype, skin disease extent, and extracutaneous involvement. Conclusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting juvenile LS comparative effectiveness studies. The CTP were found to be safe, effective, and tolerable. Our assessments performed well. Because damage is common and may progress despite effective control of activity, we recommend initial treatment efficacy be evaluated primarily by activity measures. Potential confounders for response were identified that warrant further study.<sep>Children with well-controlled juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) frequently experience flares after medication discontinuation, but the outcomes of these flares have not been well described. The objective of this study was to characterize the rates and predictors of disease recapture among children with JIA who restarted medication to treat disease flare.Children with JIA who discontinued conventional synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for well-controlled disease but subsequently experienced a flare and restarted medication were identified from the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) registry. The primary outcome was inactive disease (ID) (physician global assessment <1 and active joint count = 0) 6 months after flare.A total of 333 patients had complete data for ID at 6 months after flare. The recapture rate for the cohort was 55%, ranging from 47% (persistent oligoarthritis) to 69% (systemic arthritis) (P = 0.4). Approximately 67% of children achieved ID by 12 months. In the multivariable model, history and reinitiation of biologic drugs were associated with increased odds of successful recapture (odds ratio [OR] 4.79 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.22-18.78] and OR 2.74 [95% CI 1.62-4.63], respectively). Number of joints with limited range of motion was associated with decreased odds (OR 0.83 per 1 joint increase [95% CI 0.72-0.95]).Approximately half of JIA flares post-discontinuation were recaptured within 6 months, but rates of recapture varied across JIA categories. These findings inform shared decision-making for patients, families, and clinicians regarding the risks and benefits of medication discontinuation. Better understanding of biologic predictors of successful recapture in JIA are needed.<sep>The aim of this study was to evaluate factors associated with extracutaneous involvement (ECI) in juvenile localized scleroderma (jLS).A prospective, multicentre, 6-month observational study was performed. The data collected included disease features, global assessments, and subject symptoms. Bivariate and linear multilevel regression analyses were performed.A total of 86 jLS subjects (80% female, 80% Caucasian), median age of disease onset 7.7 years, were evaluated. Most had linear scleroderma or mixed morphea. Of the 86 subjects, 49 (57%) had 125 extracutaneous problems {median 2 [interquartile range (IQR) 1, 3] per subject} from nine organ systems. Most of these subjects had multiple musculoskeletal problems. ECI was associated with more extensive cutaneous involvement, higher number of symptoms, family history of autoimmunity, and ANA and RF positivity. Subjects with ECI had higher scores for physician global assessment of damage (PGA-D), and parental global assessment of disease impact, but not baseline physician global assessment of disease activity (PGA-A). Although subjects with ECI received more MTX and glucocorticoid treatment, they had a slower reduction in PGA-A scores and symptoms over time, suggesting a poorer response to treatment. In logistic regression modelling, female sex had the largest effect on parental impact scores.ECI occurred in the majority of subjects with jLS, and was associated with more medication use, longer treatment duration, higher PGA-D scores, and higher parental assessment of disease impact. Our findings suggest that jLS subjects with ECI have greater overall disease burden, both cutaneous and extracutaneous, and poorer response to treatment. More study of the treatment needs of this population is warranted.<sep>Objective The goal was to characterize short‐term kidney status and describe variation in early care utilization in a multicenter cohort of patients with childhood‐onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) and nephritis. Methods We analyzed previously collected prospective data from North American patients with cSLE with kidney biopsy‐proven nephritis enrolled in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry from March 2017 through December 2019. We determined the proportion of patients with abnormal kidney status at the most recent registry visit and applied generalized linear mixed models to identify associated factors. We also calculated frequency of medication use, both during induction and ever recorded. Results We identified 222 patients with kidney biopsy–proven nephritis, with 64% class III/IV nephritis on initial biopsy. At the most recent registry visit at median (interquartile range) of 17 (8–29) months from initial kidney biopsy, 58 of 106 patients (55%) with available data had abnormal kidney status. This finding was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR] 3.88, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.21–12.46) and age at cSLE diagnosis (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01–1.49). Patients with class IV nephritis were more likely than class III to receive cyclophosphamide and rituximab during induction. There was substantial variation in mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab ever use patterns across rheumatology centers. Conclusion In this cohort with predominately class III/IV nephritis, male sex and older age at cSLE diagnosis were associated with abnormal short‐term kidney status. We also observed substantial variation in contemporary medication use for pediatric lupus nephritis between pediatric rheumatology centers. Additional studies are needed to better understand the impact of this variation on long‐term kidney outcomes.<sep>Objective This study was undertaken to identify blood markers of juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) disease activity (DA), which are needed to improve disease management. Methods The study comprised a total of 123 juvenile DM patients and 53 healthy controls. Results of laboratory tests (aldolase, creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], aspartate aminotransferase) and clinical measures of DA in patients with juvenile DM, including the Manual Muscle Testing in 8 muscles (MMT‐8), Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS), and disease activity scores (DAS) (total DAS for juvenile DM, the muscle DAS, and the skin DAS), were recorded when available. Surface phenotype of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed using flow cytometry. Whole blood transcriptional profiles were studied using either RNA‐sequencing or microarrays. Differential gene expression was determined using DESeq and compared by pathway and gene ontology analyses. Results Conventional memory (CD27+IgD–) B cells expressing low CXCR5 levels (CXCR5 low/– CM B cells) were significantly increased in frequency and absolute numbers in 2 independent cohorts of juvenile DM patients compared with healthy controls. The frequency of CD4+ Th2 memory cells (CD45RA–CXCR5–CCR6–CXCR3–) was also increased in juvenile DM, especially in patients who were within &lt;1 year from diagnosis. The frequency of CXCR5 low/– CM B cells correlated with serum aldolase levels and with a blood interferon‐stimulated gene transcriptional signature. Furthermore, both the frequency and absolute numbers of CXCR5 low/– CM B cells correlated with clinical and laboratory measures of muscle DA (MMT‐8, CMAS, aldolase, and LDH). Conclusion These findings suggest that both CM B cells lacking the CXCR5 follicular marker and CXCR5– Th2 cells represent potential biomarkers of DA in juvenile DM and may contribute to its pathogenesis.<sep>We designed and initiated a pilot comparative effectiveness study for juvenile localized scleroderma (jLS), for which there is limited evidence on best therapy. We evaluated the process we used, in relation to the specific protocol and to the general task of identifying strategies for implementing studies in rare pediatric diseases.This was a prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study of 50 jLS patients initiating treatment, designed and conducted by the jLS group of the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) from 2012 to 2015. A series of virtual and physical meetings were held to design the study, standardize clinical assessments, generate and refine disease activity and damage measures, and monitor the study. Patients were initiated on one of three standardized methotrexate-based treatment regimens (consensus treatment plans, CTPs) and monitored for 1 year. An optional bio-banking sub-study was included.The target enrollment of 50 patients was achieved over 26 months at 10 sites, with patients enrolled into all CTPs. Enrolled patients were typical for jLS. Study eligibility criteria were found to perform well, capturing patients thought appropriate for treatment studies. Minor modifications to the eligibility criteria, primarily to facilitate recruitment for future studies, were discussed with consensus agreement reached on them by the jLS group. There were marked differences in site preferences for specific CTPs, with half the sites treating all their patients with the same CTP. Most patients (88%) completed the study, and 68% participated in the bio-banking substudy.We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for conducting comparative effectiveness research in a rare pediatric disease. Multi-center collaboration by dedicated investigators who met regularly was a key factor in the success of this project. Other factors that facilitate these studies include having a sufficient number of investigators to enroll in each regimen, and streamlining study approval and management.<sep>Juvenile localized scleroderma (LS) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are rare pediatric conditions often associated with severe morbidities. Delays in diagnosis are common, increasing the risk for permanent damage and worse outcomes. This study explored caregiver perspectives on barriers they encountered while navigating diagnosis and care for their child's scleroderma.In this cross-sectional study, caregivers of juvenile LS or SSc patients were recruited from a virtual family scleroderma educational conference and a juvenile scleroderma online interest group. The survey queried respondents about their child's condition and factors affecting diagnosis and treatment.The response rate was 61% (73/120), with 38 parents of LS patients and 31 parents of SSc patients. Most patients were female (80%) and over half were non-Hispanic white (55%). Most families had at least one person with a college education or higher (87%), traveled ≤ 2 h to see their rheumatologist (83%), and had private insurance (75%). Almost half had an annual household income ≥ $100,000 (46%). Families identified the following factors as barriers to care: lack of knowledge about scleroderma in the medical community, finding reliable information about pediatric scleroderma, long wait times/distances for a rheumatology/specialist appointment, balance of school/work and child's healthcare needs, medication side effects, and identifying effective medications. The barrier most identified as a major problem was the lack of knowledge about juvenile scleroderma in the medical community. Public insurance, household income less than $100,000, and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with specific barriers to care. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with longer travel times to see the rheumatologist/specialist. Diagnosis and systemic treatment initiation occurred at greater than one year from initial presentation for approximately 28% and 36% of patients, respectively. Families of LS patients were commonly given erroneous information about the disease, including on the need and importance of treating active disease with systemic immunosuppressants in patients with deep tissue or rapidly progressive disease.Caregivers of children with LS or SSc reported numerous common barriers to the diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care of juvenile scleroderma. The major problem highlighted was the lack of knowledge of scleroderma within the general medical community. Given that most of the caregiver respondents to the survey had relatively high socioeconomic status, additional studies are needed to reach a broader audience, including caregivers with limited English proficiency, geographical limitations, and financial constraints, to determine if the identified problems are generalizable. Identifying key care barriers will help direct efforts to address needs, reduce disparities in care, and improve patient outcomes.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/553036", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5003959016", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5007856772", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates strong expertise in chromatin biology, adipocyte function, and metabolic pathways, aligning closely with the research focus of the Liu lab on chromatin structure and epigenetics.

The UGT1A1*28 promoter polymorphism is characterized by the presence of 7 TA repeats in the TATA box sequence and results in reduced UGT1A1 gene expression and enzymatic activity. In this study, we investigated associations between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and breast cancer risk among African American (AA) women in Memphis, Tennessee, a city with increased breast cancer mortality rates among AA women. Saliva was collected from 352 AA women, including breast cancer cases (n=82) and controls (n=270) between June 2016 to June 2017.<sep>3132 Background: Homologous recombination (HR) deficient breast tumors may have genomic alterations that suggest responsiveness to targeted therapies other than PARP inhibitors. Methods: Comprehensive molecular profiles of 4,647 breast tumors performed at Caris Life Sciences using 592-gene NGS (average read depth 500X) were reviewed to identify somatic pathogenic mutations in HR genes ARID1A, ATM, ATRX, BAP1, BLM, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, CHEK1/2, FANCA/C/D2/E/F/G/L, KMT2D, MRE11, NBN, RAD50/51/51B &amp; PALB2, as well 41 markers associated with treatment response.

These variants can impact treatment response. Herein, we characterize ESR1 variants among molecularly profiled breast cancers. Methods: DNA next-generation sequencing (592-gene panel) data from 9860 breast cancer samples were retrospectively reviewed. Gene fusions were detected using the ArcherDx fusion assay or whole transcriptome sequencing (N = 344 and N = 4305, respectively). Statistical analyses included Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests.

In contrast to the other three members of the EGFR family (i.e., EGFR, ERBB2/HER2/NEU, and ERBB3), which are associated with aggressive forms of human cancers, ERBB4 expression seems to be selectively lost in tumors with aggressive phenotypes. Consistent with this observation, we show that ERBB4 induces apoptosis when reintroduced into breast cancer cell lines or when endogenous ERBB4 is activated by a ligand. We further show that ligand activation and subsequent proteolytic processing of endogenous ERBB4 results in mitochondrial<sep>Abstract Background: Symptom burden differences may contribute to racial disparities in breast cancer survival. We compared symptom changes from before to during chemotherapy among women with breast cancer. Methods: This observational study followed a cohort of Black and White women diagnosed with Stage I–III, hormone receptor–positive breast cancer from a large cancer center in 2007 to 2015, and reported symptoms before and during chemotherapy.

A humanized antibody drug conjugate (ADC) targeting Trop-2 for delivery of the topoisomerase-I (TOPO1) inhibitor SN-38 (payload) is currently in clinical development for TNBC. Clinical response in a previously reported phase I/II study was associated with Trop-2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining intensity (Bardia A et al. J Clin Oncol 2017).

One factor associated with these disparities may be differences in symptom burden, which may reduce chemotherapy tolerance and increase early treatment discontinuation.To compare symptom burden by race among women with early-stage breast cancer before starting chemotherapy and quantify symptom differences explained by baseline characteristics.A cross-sectional analysis of symptom burden differences by race among Black and White women with a diagnosis of stage I to III, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who had a symptom report collected before chemotherapy initiation in a large cancer center in the southern region of the US from January 1,<sep>e12526 Background: PALOMA-3 results demonstrated that patients (pts) with sensitivity to previous endocrine therapy had a substantial benefit with Palbociclib compared to those with intrinsic endocrine resistance (Turner NC et al.

While a multitude of recommendations exist from government organizations, academic institutions, industry sponsors, and commercial groups on approaches designed to increase enrollment, there is a lack of evidence as to the effectiveness of these recommendations in real-world settings. The West Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute (WCCRI), a community oncology center in the greater Memphis, TN area, has consistently conducted trials in which Black patients are well-represented. Of all oncology clinical trials conducted at WCCRI in 2021, Black patients represented 29.9% of the<sep>Breast cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in females in the United States.

Although AR expression is associated with more indolent tumors, high AR expression relative to ER is associated with endocrine resistance, and in the absence of estradiol or if ER function is blocked, preclinical studies suggest that AR can take over to signal cell survival and proliferation. Following extensive preclinical studies and a brief phase I to demonstrate a lack of significant PK interaction, this phase II trial of fulvestrant plus enzalutamide in ER+/Her2- metastatic breast cancer was conducted.

Specifically, we model the payoff function as a Gaussian process and formulate a novel type of upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function that guides exploration towards the bandits that are deemed most relevant according to the variability of the observed rewards. This is achieved by computing a tractable likelihood ratio that quantifies the importance of the output relative to the inputs and essentially acts as an \\textit{attention mechanism} that promotes exploration of extreme rewards. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methodology across several synthetic benchmarks, as well as a realistic example involving noisy sensor network data. Finally, we provide a JAX library for efficient bandit optimization using Gaussian processes.<sep>In Bayesian optimization, accounting for the importance of the output relative to the input is a crucial yet challenging exercise, as it can considerably improve the final result but often involves inaccurate and cumbersome entropy estimations. We approach the problem from the perspective of importance-sampling theory, and advocate the use of the likelihood ratio to guide the search algorithm towards regions of the input space where the objective function assumes abnormally large or small values. The likelihood ratio acts as a sampling weight and can be computed at each iteration without severely deteriorating the overall efficiency of the algorithm. In particular, it can be approximated in a way that makes the approach tractable in high dimensions. The likelihood-weighted acquisition functions introduced in this work are found to outperform their unweighted counterparts in a number of applications.<sep>In Bayesian optimization, accounting for the importance of the output relative to the input is a crucial yet challenging exercise, as it can considerably improve the final result but often involves inaccurate and cumbersome entropy estimations.

The success of the mission is judged by the UAV’s ability to faithfully reconstruct any anomalous features present in the environment, with emphasis on the extremes (e.g., extreme topographic depressions or abnormal chemical concentrations). We show that the criteria commonly used for determining which locations the UAV should visit are ill-suited for this task. We introduce a number of novel criteria that guide the UAV toward regions of strong anomalies by leveraging previously collected information in a mathematically elegant and computationally tractable manner. We demonstrate superiority of the proposed approach in several applications, including reconstruction of seafloor topography from real-world bathymetry data, as well as tracking of dynamic anomalies. A particularly attractive property of our approach is its ability to overcome adversarial conditions, that is, situations in which prior beliefs about the locations of the extremes are imprecise or erroneous.<sep>We computationally investigate flow past a three-dimensional linearly sprung cylinder undergoing vortex-induced vibration (VIV) transverse to the free stream and equipped with an internal dissipative rotational nonlinear energy sink (NES). The rotational NES consists of a line mass allowed to rotate at constant radius about the cylinder axis, with linearly damped rotational motion. We consider a value of the Reynolds number ($$\\textit{Re}=10{,}000$$, based on the cylinder diameter and free-stream velocity) at which flow past a linearly sprung cylinder with no NES is three-dimensional and fully turbulent. For this $$\\textit{Re}$$ value, we show that the rotational NES is capable of passively harnessing a substantial amount of kinetic energy from the rectilinear motion of the cylinder, leading to a significant suppression of cylinder oscillation and a nearly twofold reduction in drag. The results presented herein are of practical significance since they demonstrate a novel passive mechanism for VIV suppression and drag reduction in a high-$$\\textit{Re}$$ bluff body flow, and lay down the groundwork for designing nonlinear energy sinks with a view to enhancing the performance of VIV-induced power generation in marine currents.<sep>A key question in flow control is that of the design of optimal controllers when the control space is high-dimensional and the experimental or computational budget is limited. We address this formidable challenge using a particular flavor of machine learning and present the first application of Bayesian optimization to the design of open-loop controllers for fluid flows. We consider a range of acquisition functions, including the recently introduced output-informed criteria of Blanchard and Sapsis (2021), and evaluate performance of the Bayesian algorithm in two iconic configurations for active flow control: computationally, with drag reduction in the fluidic pinball; and experimentally, with mixing enhancement in a turbulent jet. For these flows, we find that Bayesian optimization identifies optimal controllers at a fraction of the cost of other optimization strategies considered in previous studies. Bayesian optimization also provides, as a by-product of the optimization, a surrogate model for the latent cost function, which can be leveraged to paint a complete picture of the control landscape. The proposed methodology can be used to design open-loop controllers for virtually any complex flow and, therefore, has significant implications for active flow control at an industrial scale.<sep>We derive criteria for the selection of datapoints used for data-driven reduced-order modeling and other areas of supervised learning based on Gaussian process regression (GPR). While this is a well-studied area in the fields of active learning and optimal experimental design, most criteria in the literature are empirical. Here we introduce an optimality condition for the selection of a new input defined as the minimizer of the distance between the approximated output probability density function (pdf) of the reduced-order model and the exact one. Given that the exact pdf is unknown, we define the selection criterion as the supremum over the unit sphere of the native Hilbert space for the GPR. The resulting selection criterion, however, has a form that is difficult to compute. We combine results from GPR theory and asymptotic analysis to derive a computable form of the defined optimality criterion that is valid in the limit of small predictive variance. The derived asymptotic form of the selection criterion leads to convergence of the GPR model that guarantees a balanced distribution of data resources between probable and large-deviation outputs, resulting in an effective way for sampling towards data-driven reduced-order modeling.<sep>We derive criteria for the selection of datapoints used for data-driven reduced-order modelling and other areas of supervised learning based on Gaussian process regression (GPR).

We describe steps to perform a proof-of-principle chemical screen in non-transformed hTERT RPE-1 TP53-/- cells with higher coverage and greater timepoint resolution compared to genome-wide screens. This approach can be adapted for use in various cell lines, compounds, and other focused sgRNA libraries.<sep>γ-Aminobutyric acid B receptors (GABABRs) are broadly expressed throughout the central nervous system where they play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. GABABRs are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate slow and sustained inhibitory actions via modulation of several downstream effector enzymes and ion channels. GABABRs are obligate heterodimers that associate with diverse arrays of proteins to form modular complexes that carry out distinct physiological functions. GABABR-dependent signaling is fine-tuned and regulated through a multitude of mechanisms that are relevant to physiological and pathophysiological states. This review summarizes the current knowledge on GABABR signal transduction and discusses key factors that influence the strength and sensitivity of GABABR-dependent signaling in neurons.<sep>Significance Mechanisms promoting the compartmentalization of G-protein signaling are poorly understood in native cells. This study examined muscarinic (M 2 R) and adenosine (A 1 R) receptor signaling to a common effector—the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK) channel—in mouse sino-atrial nodal (SAN) cells. Regulator of G protein Signaling 6 (RGS6) exerts a GPCR-dependent influence on the efficacy, kinetics, and sensitivity of GIRK-dependent signaling in SAN cells, suppressing M 2 R-GIRK signaling kinetics and sensitivity and A 1 R-GIRK signaling amplitude. The distinctions can be explained by the differential utilization of G protein isoforms by M 2 R and A 1 R and a Gα o substrate preference of RGS6. Thus, GPCR-G protein<sep>It is well known that the neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons increase appetite and decrease thermogenesis. Previous studies demonstrated that optogenetic and/or chemogenetic manipulations of NPY/AgRP neuronal activity alter food intake and/or energy expenditure (EE). However, little is known about intrinsic molecules regulating NPY/AgRP neuronal excitability to affect long-term metabolic function. Here, we found that the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK) channels are key to stabilize NPY/AgRP neurons and that NPY/AgRP neuron-selective deletion of the GIRK2 subunit results in a persistently increased excitability of the NPY/AgRP neurons. Interestingly, increased body weight and adiposity observed in the NPY/AgRP neuron-selective GIRK2 knockout mice were due to decreased sympathetic activity and EE, while food<sep>Immediate early genes (IEGs) are transcribed in response to neuronal activity from sensory stimulation during multiple adaptive processes in the brain. The transcriptional profile of IEGs is indicative of the duration of neuronal activity, but its sensitivity to the strength of depolarization remains unknown. Also unknown is whether activity history of graded potential changes influence future neuronal activity. In this work with dissociated rat cortical neurons, we found that mild depolarization-mediated by elevated extracellular potassium (K+)-induces a wide array of rapid IEGs and transiently depresses transcriptional and signaling responses to a successive stimulus. This latter effect was independent of de novo transcription, translation, and signaling via calcineurin or mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, as measured<sep>Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses wide-ranging neuropsychiatric symptoms with unclear etiology. Although the cerebellum is a key region implicated in ASD, it remains elusive how the cerebellar circuitry is altered and whether the cerebellum can serve as a therapeutic target to rectify the phenotype of idiopathic ASD with polygenic abnormalities. Using a syndromic ASD model, e.g., Black and Tan BRachyury T + Itpr3 tf /J (BTBR) mice, we revealed that increased excitability of presynaptic interneurons (INs) and decreased intrinsic excitability of postsynaptic Purkinje neurons (PNs) resulted in low PN firing rates in the cerebellum. Knowing that downregulation of Kv1.2 potassium channel in the IN nerve terminals likely augmented their excitability and GABA release,<sep>Sinus node (SAN) dysfunction (SND) manifests as low heart rate (HR) and is often accompanied by atrial tachycardia or atrioventricular (AV) block. The only currently available therapy for chronic SND is the implantation of an electronic pacemaker. Because of the growing burden of SND in the population, new pharmacological therapies of chronic SND and heart block are desirable. We developed a collection of genetically modified mouse strains recapitulating human primary SND associated with different degrees of AV block. These mice were generated with genetic ablation of L-type Cav1.3 (Cav1.3-/-), T-type Cav3.1 (Cav3.1-/-), or both (Cav1.3-/-/Cav3.1-/-). We also studied mice haplo-insufficient for the Na+ channel Nav1.5 (Nav1.5+/) and mice in which the cAMP-dependent regulation of<sep>G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK/Kir3) channels exert a critical inhibitory influence on neurons. Neuronal GIRK channels mediate the G protein-dependent, direct/postsynaptic inhibitory effect of many neurotransmitters including γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, dopamine, adenosine, somatostatin, and enkephalin. In addition to their complex regulation by G proteins, neuronal GIRK channel activity is sensitive to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ), phosphorylation, regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, intracellular Na + and Ca 2+ , and cholesterol. The application of genetic and viral manipulations in rodent models, together with recent progress in the development of GIRK channel modulators, has increased our understanding of the physiological and behavioral impact of neuronal GIRK channels. Work in rodent<sep>Long bones are formed and repaired through the process of endochondral ossification. Activation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways is crucial for skeletal development and long bone growth. G protein-gated inwardly-rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel genes are key functional components and effectors of GPCR signaling pathways in excitable cells of the heart and brain, but their roles in non-excitable cells that directly contribute to endochondral bone formation have not been studied. In this study, we analyzed skeletal phenotypes of Girk2-/-, Girk3-/- and Girk2/3-/- mice. Bones from 12-week-old Girk2-/- mice were normal in length, but femurs and tibiae from Girk3-/- and Girk2/3-/- mice were longer than age-matched controls at 12-weeks-old. Epiphyseal chondrocytes from 5-day-old Girk3-/-<sep>Alcohol and nicotine addiction are prevalent conditions that co-occur. Despite the prevalence of co-use, factors that influence the suppression and enhancement of concurrent alcohol and nicotine intake are largely unknown. Our goals were to assess how nicotine abstinence and availability influenced concurrent alcohol consumption and to determine the impact of quinine adulteration of alcohol on aversion-resistant alcohol consumption and concurrent nicotine consumption. Male and female C57BL/6J mice voluntarily consumed unsweetened alcohol, nicotine, and water in a chronic 3-bottle choice procedure. In experiment 1, nicotine access was removed for 1 week and re-introduced the following week, while the alcohol and water bottles remained available at all times. In experiment 2, quinine (100–1000 μM) was added<sep>G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels are critical mediators of excitability in the heart and brain. Enhanced GIRK-channel activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. The lack of selective pharmacological tools has impeded efforts to investigate the therapeutic potential of cardiac GIRK-channel interventions in arrhythmias. Here, we characterize a recently identified GIRK-channel inhibitor, VU0468554. Using whole-cell electrophysiological approaches and primary cultures of sinoatrial nodal cells and hippocampal neurons, we show that VU0468554 more effectively inhibits the cardiac GIRK channel than the neuronal GIRK channel. Concentration-response experiments suggest that VU0468554 inhibits Gβγ-activated GIRK channels in noncompetitive and potentially uncompetitive fashion. In contrast, VU0468554 competitively inhibits GIRK-channel activation by<sep>ABSTRACT Background Drug-induced neuroadaptations in the prefrontal cortex are thought to underlie impaired executive functions that reinforce addictive behaviors. Repeated cocaine exposure increased layer 5/6 pyramidal neuron excitability in the mouse prelimbic cortex (PL), an adaptation attributable to a suppression of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK/Kir3) channel activity. GIRK channel suppression in the PL of drug-naïve mice enhanced the motor-stimulatory effect of cocaine. The impact of cocaine on PL GABA neurons, key pyramidal neuron regulators, and the behavioral relevance of increased PL pyramidal neuron excitability, remain unclear. Methods The effect of repeated cocaine on mouse layer 5/6 PL GABA neurons was assessed using slice electrophysiology. Adaptations enhancing PL pyramidal neuron excitability were<sep>Nicotine and alcohol are the most commonly abused substances worldwide and are frequently coabused. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing the α6 and β3 subunits are expressed in neural reward circuits and are critical for nicotine and alcohol reward. nAChRs are dynamically regulated by signaling molecules such as protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε), which impact transcription of α6 and β3 subunit mRNA (Chrna6 and Chrnb3, respectively). Previous work found decreased expression of Chrna6 and Chrnb3 transcripts in the ventral midbrain of male PKCε-/- mice, who also consume less nicotine and alcohol compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. Using RT-qPCR, we show that female PKCε-/- mice have higher expression of Chrna6 and Chrnb3 transcripts in the ventral<sep>Drug-induced neuroadaptations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been implicated in drug-associated memories that motivate continued drug use. Chronic cocaine exposure increases pyramidal neuron excitability in the prelimbic subregion of the PFC (PL), an adaptation that has been attributed in part to a suppression of inhibitory signalling mediated by the GABAB receptor (GABAB R) and G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK/Kir3) channels. Although reduced GIRK channel activity in PL pyramidal neurons enhances the motor-stimulatory effect of cocaine in mice, the impact on cocaine reward and associated memories remains unclear. Here, we employed Cre- and CRISPR/Cas9-based viral manipulation strategies to evaluate the impact of GIRK channel or GABAB R ablation in PL pyramidal neurons on<sep>Background and Purpose Drugs of abuse, including alcohol, increase dopamine in the mesocorticolimbic system via actions on dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Increased dopamine transmission can activate inhibitory G protein signalling pathways in VTA dopamine neurons, including those controlled by GABA B and D 2 receptors. Members of the R7 subfamily of regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins can regulate inhibitory G protein signalling, but their influence on VTA dopamine neurons is unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of RGS6, an R7 RGS family memberthat has been implicated in the regulation of alcohol consumption in mice, on inhibitory G protein signalling in VTA dopamine neurons. Experimental Approach We used molecular,<sep>Background The basolateral amygdala (BLA) regulates mood and associative learning and has been linked to the development and persistence of alcohol use disorder. The GABABR (gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor) is a promising therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder, and previous work suggests that exposure to ethanol and other drugs can alter neuronal GABABR-dependent signaling. The effect of ethanol on GABABR-dependent signaling in the BLA is unknown. Methods GABABR-dependent signaling in the mouse BLA was examined using slice electrophysiology following repeated ethanol exposure. Neuron-specific viral genetic manipulations were then used to understand the relevance of ethanol-induced neuroadaptations in the basal amygdala subregion (BA) to mood-related behavior. Results The somatodendritic inhibitory effect of GABABR activation on<sep>Abstract Nicotine and alcohol are the most commonly abused substances worldwide, and comorbid nicotine and alcohol addiction is highly prevalent. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing the α6 and β3 subunits are expressed in neural reward circuits and are critical for both nicotine and alcohol reward. nAChRs are dynamically regulated by signaling molecules such as protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε), which impact transcription of α6 and β3 subunit mRNA ( Chrna6 and Chrnb3 , respectively). Previous work found decreased expression of Chrna6 and Chrnb3 transcripts in the ventral midbrain of male PKCε −/− mice, who also consume less nicotine and alcohol compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. Here, we show that female PKCε −/− mice have<sep>Abstract Drugs of abuse engage overlapping but distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms to enhance dopamine (DA) signaling in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry. DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are key substrates of drugs of abuse and have been implicated in addiction-related behaviors. Enhanced VTA DA neurotransmission evoked by drugs of abuse can engage inhibitory G-protein-dependent feedback pathways, mediated by GABA B receptors (GABA B Rs) and D 2 DA receptors (D 2 Rs). Chemogenetic inhibition of VTA DA neurons potently suppressed baseline motor activity, as well as the motor-stimulatory effect of cocaine and morphine, confirming the critical influence of VTA DA neurons and inhibitory G-protein signaling in these neurons on this addiction-related behavior.<sep>Late adolescence and young adulthood, corresponding to the high school and college years, are vulnerable periods for increased alcohol and nicotine use. The dramatic increase in the prevalence of electronic cigarette use is particularly concerning in these age groups. Late adolescents and young adults are more likely to engage in cycles of binge drug consumption, and alcohol and nicotine are frequently used together. However, there are few data examining the combination of alcohol and nicotine in binge models in animal models. In this study, our objectives were to determine how voluntary nicotine consumption beginning in late adolescence influenced subsequent binge alcohol consumption in young adulthood, how a combination of alcohol and nicotine binge consumption<sep>Background and Purpose G protein‐gated inwardly rectifying K + (K ir 3) channels moderate the activity of excitable cells and have been implicated in neurological disorders and cardiac arrhythmias. Most neuronal K ir 3 channels consist of K ir 3.1 and K ir 3.2 subtypes, while cardiac K ir 3 channels consist of K ir 3.1 and K ir 3.4 subtypes. Previously, we identified a family of urea‐containing K ir 3 channel activators, but these molecules exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties and modest selectivity for K ir 3.1/3.2 relative to K ir 3.1/3.4 channels. Here, we characterize a non‐urea activator, VU0810464, which displays nanomolar potency as a K ir 3.1/3.2 activator, improved selectivity for neuronal<sep>In response to the ongoing opioid epidemic, and in an effort to develop new analgesics with improved safety profiles, researchers have invested significant energy into further understanding the various downstream signaling cascades initiated by opioid receptor activation. Recent studies have demonstrated that G protein-biased ligands demonstrate reduced side effects such as respiratory depression and tolerance. Further research has shown that bivalent or bifunctional opioid compounds can also result in differential signal transduction. We hypothesized that a combination of mu and delta opioid agonists would engage different signaling pathways than drugs that target only one opioid receptor. Therefore, we probed the signaling mechanisms underlying the behavioral analgesic synergy previously demonstrated by a 1:1 combination of<sep>ADVERTISEMENT RETURN TO ISSUEPREVCorrectionNEXTORIGINAL ARTICLEThis notice is a correctionCorrection to Analgesic Effects of the GIRK Activator, VU0466551, Alone and in Combination with Morphine in Acute and Persistent Pain ModelsKristopher K.

Most ischemic episodes are triggered by an increase in heart rate, which induces an imbalance between myocardial oxygen delivery and consumption. Developing drugs that selectively reduce heart rate by inhibiting ion channels involved in heart rate control could provide more clinical benefits. The Cav1.3-mediated L-type Ca2+ current (ICav1.3) play important roles in the generation of heart rate. Therefore, they can constitute relevant targets for selective control of heart rate and cardioprotection during AMI.We aimed to investigate the relationship between heart rate and infarct size using mouse strains knockout for Cav1.3 (Cav1.3-/-) L-type calcium channel and of the cardiac G protein gated potassium<sep>Drug-induced neuroadaptations in the mPFC have been implicated in addictive behaviors. Repeated cocaine exposure has been shown to increase pyramidal neuron excitability in the prelimbic (PL) region of the mouse mPFC, an adaptation attributable to a suppression of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK) channel activity. After establishing that this neuroadaptation is not seen in adjacent GABA neurons, we used viral GIRK channel ablation and complementary chemogenetic approaches to selectively enhance PL pyramidal neuron excitability in adult mice, to evaluate the impact of this form of plasticity on PL-dependent behaviors. GIRK channel ablation decreased somatodendritic GABA B receptor-dependent signaling and rheobase in PL pyramidal neurons. This manipulation also enhanced the motor-stimulatory effect of<sep>Systemic administration of ML297, a selective activator of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels, decreases innate avoidance behavior in male C57BL/6J mice. The cellular mechanisms mediating the ML297-induced suppression of avoidance behavior are unknown. Here, we show that systemic ML297 administration suppresses elevated plus maze (EPM)-induced neuronal activation in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) and that ML297 activates GIRK1-containing GIRK channels in these limbic structures. While intracranial infusion of ML297 into the vHPC suppressed avoidance behavior in the EPM test, mirroring the effect of systemic ML297, intra-BLA administration of ML297 provoked the opposite effect. Using neuron-specific viral genetic and chemogenetic approaches, we found that the combined inhibition of excitatory neurons in<sep>Dopamine (DA) neurons of the VTA have been widely implicated in the cellular and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. Inhibitory G protein signaling mediated by GABAB receptors (GABABRs) and D2 DA receptors (D2Rs) regulates the excitability of VTA DA neurons, DA neurotransmission, and behaviors modulated by DA. Most of the somatodendritic inhibitory effect of GABABR and D2R activation on DA neurons reflects the activation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels. Furthermore, GIRK-dependent signaling in VTA DA neurons can be weakened by exposure to psychostimulants and strengthened by phasic DA neuron firing. The objective of this study was to determine how the strength of GIRK channel activity in VTA DA neurons influences<sep><b>Abstract ID 21794</b> <b>Poster Board 369</b> Amyloid β oligomers (AβOs) are one of the primary pathogenic factors in Alzheimer’s Disease and have been shown to induce excitotoxicity in the hippocampus in both acute and chronic models.

Our group and others have established G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels as critical mediators of GABAB receptor-dependent signaling, impacting neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function.

The strength of M 2 R‐GIRK signaling is negatively regulated by Regulator of G protein Signaling 6 (RGS6). Adenosine, used clinically to diagnose and treat certain arrhythmias, exerts these actions through A1 adenosine receptor (A 1 R) activation of GIRK channels. The extent to which RGS6 regulates A 1 R‐GIRK signaling, however, is unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of RGS6 on A 1 R‐GIRK and M 2 R‐GIRK signaling in mouse SAN cells. Methods and Results We measured the efficacy and potency<sep>Introduction Parasympathetic slowing of heart rate is largely mediated by muscarinic receptor (M2R) activation of the G protein gated inwardly‐rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel on sinoatrial nodal (SAN) cells and atrial myocytes. The strength of M2R‐GIRK signaling is negatively regulated by regulator of G protein signaling 6, RGS6. Genetic ablation of RGS6 in mice gives rise to enhanced M2R‐GIRK signaling in SAN cells, resulting in both exaggerated M2R‐induced bradycardia and increased susceptibility to pacing‐induced atrial fibrillation.

One of the processes was a moving bed TSA process while the other two process were fixed bed processes using a packed bed containing pellets and hollow fiber modules. With Lewatit as the sorbent chosen, the cycle configurations were optimized to identify minimum energy and maximum productivity values for CO2 capture from a natural gas combustion cycle (NGCC) flue gas. The hollow fiber TSA process had the highest productivity of 4.25 mol CO2/m3 ads s, followed by the fixed bed and the moving bed TSA processes with values of 2.03 and 1.68 4.25 mol CO2/m3 ads s, respectively<sep>Summary In this paper, we introduce numerical methods that can simulate complex multiphase flows. The finite volume method, applying Cartesian cut‐cell is used in the computational domain, containing fluid and solid, to conserve mass and momentum. With this method, flows in and around any geometry can be simulated without complex and time consuming meshing. For the fluid region, which involves liquid and gas, the ghost fluid method is employed to handle the stiffness of the interface discontinuity problem. The interaction between each phase is treated simply by wall function models or jump conditions of pressure, velocity and shear stress at the interface. The sharp interface method “coupled level set (LS) and volume of fluid (VOF)” is used to represent the interface between the two fluid phases. This approach will combine some advantages of both interface tracking/capturing methods, such as the excellent mass conservation from the VOF method and good accuracy of interface normal computation from the LS function. The first coupled LS and VOF will be generated to reconstruct the interface between solid and the other materials. The second will represent the interface between liquid and gas.<sep>An early phase feasibility study was carried out for offshore CO2 capture from ship engines of a CO2 transport ship. A flexible in-house process simulator was applied in the assessments. Parametric studies of the overall onboard process were enabled by a fast data-driven capture plant model derived from supervised machine learning by PLS regression of a large dataset of rigorous simulations. The results show, based on the given models and assumptions, that the thermal energy coming from the ship engine exhaust gas is not sufficient alone to cover the thermal energy demand of an absorption-based CO2 capture unit operating above 50% capture rate using 30 wt% MEA (mono-ethanolamine) as solvent. The thermal energy demand can be met using a fuel afterburner as heat source. The added fuel consumption is estimated to increase the fuel consumption by 6–9% when operating with liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel source, while an increase of 8–12% is expected with diesel as fuel source. The effect of absorber height on energy consumption at a given CO2 capture rate is limited, especially for lower capture rates, and may be an important degree of freedom for optimizing the CAPEX/OPEX trade-offs. Use of state-of-the art solvents with lower specific energy consumptions will shift the results towards higher capture rates before a fuel afterburner is required to meet the thermal energy demands.<sep>When using Computational Fluid Dynamics to simulate ventricular blood flow in the heart, it has been common practice to neglect the effect of the sub-valvular apparatus and the trabeculae on the flow conditions. In this study, we analyze the effect of neglecting the chordae tendineae on the fluid flow and pressure drop. To test the assumption we use a previously developed dynamic 3D model of the left ventricle, aorta and valves that is based on 3D echocardiographic recordings. To this model we add the chordae tendineae as a sub-grid model. The previously developed 3D model for the left ventricle during systole is based on real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) recordings of a 30 years old female volunteer. The segmented ventricular wall does not include details of the aorta and the mitral valve, so these were reconstructed. The subgrid model for the flow across the chordae tendineae is based on the Actuator Line Method, which means that they are represented by drag coefficients. The analysis shows that the effect of the chordae tendineae on the pressure drop and work efficiency of the normal heart during systole is minor, and it seems that for simulating ventricular fluid flow and pressure drop during systole, one can follow the current practice and ignore the chordae. However, there can be local effects such as small vortices behind the chordae. Whether such effects are important for a particular application must be evaluated for the given case.<sep>Momentum is gathering behind the goal of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 in Europe and around the world. Negative emissions via biomass or waste combustion with CO2 capture can make net zero considerably easier to achieve. This study investigates CO2 capture from combined heat and power (CHP) plants that often use bio-based fuels. However, most CO2 capture processes require large amounts of heat, potentially consuming most of the CHP plant’s primary product. The novel continuous swing adsorption reactor (CSAR) concept provides a promising solution by capturing CO2 using electrically driven heat and vacuum pumps. Techno-economic assessments conducted in this work illustrate that CSAR clearly outperforms an MEA benchmark when the CHP plant sells heat throughout the year (MEA would need a heat price below 10 €/MWh at an electricity price of 60 €/MWh to compete). When large amounts of free heat are available in summer months, MEA becomes more attractive, but a flexible CSAR configuration utilizing free heat during summer maintains a clear advantage for CSAR (MEA needs a heat price below 15 €/MWh at an electricity price of 60 €/MWh). Stronger competition arises from advanced solvents such as PZ/AMP that can match CSAR at almost double the heat price of MEA. Still, CSAR will remain attractive in most cases, especially for retrofits where considerable capital expenditures would be required to provide existing heat customers with an alternative heat supply if solvent technologies are used. Thus, CSAR appears to be a promising technology for achieving negative emissions from CHP plants.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Feature (linguistics)<sep>Stability (learning

This job now has become more convenient due to the use of BIM. This paper proposes a process for BIM-based clash detection for introducing to the BIM practitioners in Vietnam. This process was then adopted in a complicated control house, which is a part of transformer station project in Vietnam, where the design was developed with 2D-CAD. The process discovered 36 design conflicts, including inconsistencies and geometric interferences. The results contribute as a proof-of-concept of BIM-based design conflict detection in Vietnam, where BIM is not very widely adopted.<sep>Abstract Vietnam has been shifting from a centrally planned economy with subsidy schemes, to a socialist-oriented market economy with multiple economic components. The internal dynamics and external pressures have caused many changes in the environment for small and medium size construction enterprises. This research models the external environment in order to aid understanding of the strategic management of such contractors in the construction industry of Vietnam. Semi-structured interviews of senior managers were combined with a mailed questionnaire to collect data. Seven major concepts were found to emerge including the economic administration of the country, the legacy of the old system, changes in society, nature of the workforce and the variety of business styles found. The research results show that the behaviour of key stakeholders has a major impact on the strategic/competitive behaviour of the concerned firms and their profitability.<sep>Abstract Literature shows that adaptive reuse must consider vernacular architecture. For a tourism town like Sapa and its neighbouring villages in Vietnam, which is characterised with diverse terrain and climate conditions, adaptive reuse of housing regarding vernacular architecture needs to be addressed as sustainable local cultural values to attract tourists, especially foreign tourists. This paper, using data collected from 5 neighboring villages of Sapa, has investigated the villages’ residence characteristics, customs, and traditional house building designs styles and types of villages. A triangular approach of historical approach, systematic approach and the interdisciplinary approach has been adopted for the research to discover, consolidate and promote the values of village landscape and traditional housing. The proposed approach ensures villages retain their traditional indigenous state by building the image of traditional buildings encouraging concentrated living, and implementing concentrated tourism by village. Small sized areas can adopt small types of tourist accommodation. Both adaptation to climate and environmental change and adaptation to the deep intervention of technology in life need to be considered. The proposals will not only help protect the special values of Sapa, but also make good use of new development opportunities.<sep>ABSTRACT The use of life-cycle costing in construction management is fruitful. There is an abundance of tailored, casespecific methods of LCC being developed for use in different cases or industries. However, in public buildings in Vietnam, due to the unavailability of cost, norm data and official guidance, no case of LCC use has been discovered in practice. The paper proposes an adapted approach for LCC in which life-cycle cost can be calculated as a sum of three major elements: initial construction costs, operation and maintenance costs, and the deconstruction costs. For illustration, the paper introduces a case study in calculating life-cycle cost for the Vietnam Securities Depository Centre, the first public office building being accredited as a green building under LOTUS scheme in the country. Using the same process, life-cycle costs can be calculated for other design alternatives for the building. The results are then compared to support the decision-making process to get the most viable alternative. Though this approach has some shortcomings, practitioners can find it as a step-by-step guidance for LCC; they can also use lessons learned from the case study to deal with the lack of detailed data for conducting an estimation of life-cycle costs for public buildings projects.<sep>Abstract The paper presents research results from 90 BIM jobs vacancies for the AEC industry in Vietnam which were advertised on popular recruitment channels. The results show that BIM jobs in the South are more popular than in the North and the Central. BIM-related job positions are different from company to company, but this study groups those positions into three basic positions according to the international best practice approach: BIM Manager, BIM Coordinator, BIM Modeler. For BIM Modelers, their main job is to develop 3D models, deploy design documents, and coordinate with stakeholders to perform the work. BIM Coordinator’s on-demand job is to coordinate models across disciplines, check conflict and report, control models, support project management. The main task of a BIM Manager is to manage and develop BIM uses, to ensure the information to be communicated among the parties in the projects, and train BIM human resources in the company. There are many requirements for these positions, among them are the two basic requirements of “experience” and “software” (organisations may use different software for the BIM uses they apply). The article also emphasizes the need to have more involvement of professional associations, state management agencies, etc. to standardize job positions, then later they can award BIM licenses to the proper human resources appropriately.<sep>Circular bio-based building materials are “materials wholly or partly derived from renewable biological origins, or by-products and biowaste of plant and/or animal biomass that can be used as raw building materials and decorating items in construction, in their original forms or after being reprocessed”. Literature shows that using these materials can represent a coherent solution to mitigate the climate impacts of the building sector according to the circular economy model. However, previous studies are fragmented due to the heterogeneity in the studied material types, scales of case studies, and sustainability assessment methods applied. Therefore, this systematic and bibliometric literature review of 97 articles aims to categorise case studies, review the state-of-the-art of sustainability assessment of case studies and highlight the pros and cons of circular bio-based building materials. Results indicate that the material scale is the most researched compared to the other scales. Environmental analysis, primarily employing life cycle assessment, is the most frequently researched, followed by economic analysis, while social impact research is still in an early stage. Concerning the pros and cons, circular bio-based building materials outperform traditional materials in reducing initial production costs and mitigating environmental impacts, especially climate change and abiotic resource use. However, some materials perform worse in categories like eutrophication, land use, etc., and may not be economically viable from an entire life cycle perspective.<sep>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established in 1967 to promote the integration and creation of new opportunities for citizens of ASEAN member countries. ASEAN member countries have signed mutual recognition agreements on services (including services in the construction industry) since 2005 to facilitate the movement of human resources in ASEAN countries, with engineering services qualifications being one of the eight professional qualification recognition schemes in the region. In particular, a recent trend in the construction industry is the use of building information modeling (BIM). While BIM practitioners are increasing, BIM Practitioner Certifications (BPCs) have not yet been legalized and recognized. This study conducted interviews and a survey with industry experts, finding as a result that the recognition of the competency of BIM practitioners is in demand and needs to be legalized with the recognition of experienced engineers via registration or licensing to include BPCs. This is an important step for removing artificial barriers to the free movement and practice of professional engineers amongst ASEAN countries. Additionally, evidence suggests that the BIM workforce’s benefits only become realizable when BIM certifications are systematic and recognized. Based on the survey results and expert interviews, BIM practitioners are certificated according to three main roles: manager, coordinator and modeler. Finally, a framework for issuing BPCs is proposed in this study. This study’s results are expected to contribute significantly to the success of BIM practitioner mobility among ASEAN member countries for sustainable economic development.<sep>Using circular bio-based building materials is considered a promising solution to reduce the environmental impacts of the construction industry. To identify the pros and cons of these materials, it is essential to investigate their sustainability performance. However, the previous sustainability assessment studies are heterogeneous regarding the assessment methods and objectives, highlighting the need for a review to identify and analyse these aspects. Moreover, there is still a lack of studies reviewing the methodological issues and implications of the assessment methods, as well as the current end-of-life scenarios and circularity options for these materials. To address these gaps, this study conducts a systematic and critical review of a sample of 97 articles. The results indicate that Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the most frequently applied method, yet most studies are cradle-to-gate analyses of materials. Otherwise, very few studies consider the end-of-life phase, and most of the end-of-life scenarios analysed are unsustainable and have low circularity levels. The analysis also highlights the methodological issues of the assessment methods used, with a particular focus on LCA, such as a lack of consensus on system boundaries, functional units, and databases for facilitating sustainability assessments associated with the use of circular bio-based building materials. Two primary recommendations emerge from the analysis. Firstly, for LCA studies, it is recommended to increase transparency and harmonisation in assessments to improve the comparability of results. Besides, to overcome data availability issues, it is recommended to use data from multiple sources and conduct sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Secondly, more sustainability assessments (including the three pillars) considering the whole life cycle with more sustainable end-of-life scenarios and circularity options for these materials should be conducted.<sep>Purpose This paper aims to Test the capabilities/accuracies of four deep learning pre trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models to detect and classify types of highway cracks, as well as developing a new CNN model to maximize the accuracy at different learning rates. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 4,663 images of highway cracks were collected and classified into three categories of cracks, namely, “vertical cracks,” “horizontal and vertical cracks” and “diagonal cracks,” subsequently, using “Matlab” to classify the sample to training (70%) and testing (30%) to apply the four deep learning CNN models and compute their accuracies. After that, developing a new deep learning CNN model to maximize the accuracy of detecting and classifying highway cracks and testing the accuracy using three optimization algorithms at different learning rates. Findings The accuracies result of the four deep learning pre-trained models are above the averages between top-1 and top-5 and the accuracy of classifying and detecting the samples exceeded the top-5 accuracy for the pre-trained AlexNet model around 3% and by 0.2% for the GoogleNet model. The accurate model here is the GoogleNet model as the accuracy is 89.08% and it is higher than AlexNet by 1.26%. While the computed accuracy for the new created deep learning CNN model exceeded all pre-trained models by achieving 97.62% at a learning rate of 0.001 using Adam’s optimization algorithm. Practical implications The created deep learning CNN model will enable users (e.g. highway agencies) to scan a long highway and detect types of cracks accurately in a very short time compared to traditional approaches. Originality/value A new deep learning CNN-based highway cracks detection was developed based on testing four pre-trained CNN models and analyze the capabilities of each model to maximize the accuracy of the proposed CNN.<sep>It is claimed that Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been adopted in the construction industry in Vietnam since early 2000. However, in practice, this proves not to be the case, particularly in the context of construction projects funded with state-managed capital. Considering that such funding accounts for the largest market share in construction funded projects in Vietnam, further investigation is warranted. A preliminary survey reveals that the owners and other stakeholders of these projects are cautious of BIM adoption, primarily due to avoiding legal issues that may arise in such projects. In this context, this paper aims to explore the potential legal issues of BIM adoption and propose solutions for the stakeholders. The results will aid in avoiding the issues outlined, which can aid in promoting BIM adoption in Vietnam. Literature shows that the legal issues are not only applicable to Vietnam, but to other countries. To identify the legal issues which arise from BIM adoption in construction projects globally, a through literature review is carried out, where then a survey is performed with stakeholders of construction projects funded with state-managed capital in Vietnam. This then provides the opportunity to verify if the literature findings apply to Vietnam, as well as to discover new issues in a Vietnamese context. According to the survey results, the biggest legal issues for BIM adoption in construction projects funded with state-managed capital in Vietnam are; (i) no expenses system for BIM implementation available, so there is no source of funding for paying consultants/contractors for BIM; (ii) rights and obligations of stakeholders in BIM projects are not defined clearly in the relevant regulations, so there is a high risk of claims and disputes arising; (iii) no digital submission system available, thereby BIM models are not accepted, but hardcopy printouts used, leading to significant work of reviewing and verification of as-built documents. Solutions for these issues are generated and validated with focus groups, which lead to the suggestions of regulation alterations as well as revisions of contract forms/articles applied in construction projects funded with state-managed capital in Vietnam<sep>Purpose This paper aims to provide an integrated BIM-based approach for quantity take-off for progress payments in the context of high-rise buildings in Vietnam. It tries to find answers for the following questions: (1) When to start the QTO processes to facilitate the contract progress payments? (2) What information is required to measure the quantity of works to estimate contract progress payment (3) What are the challenges to manage (i.e. create, store, update and exploit)? What are the required information for this BIM use? and (4) How to process the information to deliver BIM-based QTO to facilitate contract progress payment? Design/methodology/approach The paper applied a deductive approach and expert consensus through a Delphi procedure to adapt to current innovation around BIM-based QTO. Starting with a literature review, it then discusses current practices in BIM-based QTO in general and high-rise building projects in particular. Challenges were compiled from the previous studies for references for BIM-based QTO to facilitate contract progress payment for high-rise building projects in Vietnam. A framework was developed considering a standard information management process throughout the construction lifecycle, when the BIM use of this study is delivered. The framework was validated with Delphi technique. Findings Four major challenges for BIM-based QTO discovered: new types of information required for the BIM model, changes and updates as projects progress, low interoperability between BIM model and estimation software, potentiality of low productivity and accuracy in data entry. Required information for QTO to facilitate progress payments in high-rise building projects include Object Geometric/Appearance Information, Structural Components' Definition and Contextual Information. Trade-offs between “Speed – Level of Detail–Applicable Breadth” and “Quality – Productivity” are proposed to consider the information amount to input at a time when creating/updating BIM objects. Interoperability check needed for creating, authoring/updating processing the BIM model's objects. Research limitations/implications This paper is not flawless. The first limitation lies in that the theoretical framework was established only based on desk research and small number of expert judgment. Further primary data collection would be needed to determine exactly how the framework underlies widespread practices. Secondly, this study only discussed the quantity take-off specifically for contract progress payment, but not for other purposes or broader BIM uses. Further research in this field would be of great help in developing a standard protocol for automatic quantity surveying system in Vietnam. Originality/value A new theoretical framework for BIM-based QTO validated with Delphi technique to facilitate progress payments for high-rise building projects, considering all information management stages and the phases of information development in the project lifecycle. The framework identified four types of information required for this QTO, detailed considerations for strategies (Library Objects Development, BIM Objects Information Declaration, BIM-based QTO) for better managing the information for this BIM use. Two trade-offs of “Speed – LOD–Applicable Breadth” and “Quality – Productivity” have been proposed for facilitating the strategies and also for enhancing the total efficiency and effectiveness of the QTO process.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/58336/assistant-professor-in-engineering/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5083757418", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5081866324", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description, particularly in areas such as IoT, robotics, and computational intelligence, as evidenced by their extensive research in dynamic reliability analysis, risk assessment, and optimization algorithms.

However, in planta delivery of the two core GE components, Cas9 and small guide RNA (sgRNA), often involves time-consuming and labor-intensive production of transgenic plants. Here we show that Foxtail mosaic virus, a monocot- and dicot-infecting potexvirus, can simultaneously express Cas9, sgRNA, and an RNAi suppressor to efficiently induce GE in Nicotiana benthamiana through a transgenic plant-free manner.<sep>Many Gram-positive spore-forming rhizobacteria of the genus Bacillus show potential as biocontrol biopesticides agricultural that promise improved sustainability and ecologically safety in agriculture. Here we present a draft-quality genome sequence for Bacillus velezensis EU07, which shows growth-promotion in tomato plants and biocontrol against fusarium head blight. We found that the genome of EU07 is almost identical to that of the commercially used strain QST713 but identified 46 single-nucleotide differences that distinguish these strains from each other. The availability of this genome sequence will facilitate future efforts to unravel the genetic and molecular basis for its beneficial properties.<sep>Spinach RNA-mimicking GFP (S-RMG) has been successfully used to monitor cellular RNAs including microRNAs in bacterium, yeast, and human cells. However, S-RMG has not been established in plants. In this study, we found that like bacterial, yeast, and human cellular tRNAs, plant tRNAs such as tRNALys can protect and/or stabilize the Spinach RNA aptamer interaction with the fluorophore DFHBI enabling detectable levels of green fluorescence to be emitted. The tRNALys-Spinach-tRNALys, once delivered into \"chloroplast-free\" onion epidermal cells can emit strong green fluorescence in the presence of DFHBI. Our results demonstrate for the first time that Spinach-based RNA visualization has the potential for in vivo monitoring of RNAs in plant cells.<sep>The interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and diploid biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) has been a model for investigating plant-pathogen systems. Several R-genes conferring resistance to Hpa and signalling genes playing a role in the immune system have been cloned from Arabidopsis. Similarly, several effectors from Hpa that are recognized by the cloned R-genes have been identified and investigated. Although a vast amount of resources including mutant lines for Arabidopsis exist, lack of genetic manipulation methods for Hpa has hampered studies on pathogenicity related genes. This, in turn, has hindered the discovery of Hpa genes that are involved in spore germination, appressorium, haustorium and conidiophore development. We investigated whether the exogenous application of small RNAs, known as spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS), could silence selected target genes in Hpa. We showed that it is possible to use single or double stranded sRNAs to silence these targeted genes. The latest findings will be presented.<sep>Plant diseases cause significant decreases in yield and quality of crops and consequently pose a very substantial threat to food security. In the continuous search for environmentally friendly crop protection, exploitation of RNA interferance machinery is showing promising results. It is well established that small RNAs (sRNAs) including microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) are involved in the regulation of gene expression via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA silencing. sRNAs from host plants can enter into pathogen cells during invasion and silence pathogen genes. This process has been exploited through Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS), in which plant transgenes that produce sRNAs are engineered to silence pest and pathogen genes. Similarly, exogenously applied sRNAs can enter pest and pathogen cells, either directly or via the hosts, and silence target genes. This process has been exploited in Spray-Induced Gene Silencing (SIGS). Here, we focus on the role of sRNAs and review how they have recently been used against various plant pathogens through HIGS or SIGS-based methods and discuss advantages and drawbacks of<sep>Fusarium graminearum (Fg) causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease in wheat and barley. This pathogen produces mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (DON), the T-2 and fumorisin B1. Translocation of the mycotoxins in grains causes important losses in yields and contributes to serious health problems in humans and livestock. We tested the Bacillus strains, two commercial, QST713 (Serenade®) and FZB24 (TAEGRO®) and one non-commercial strain EU07 as microbial biological control agents against the F. graminearum strain Fg-K1-4 both in vitro and in planta. The EU07 strain showed better performance in suppressing the growth of Fg-K1-4. Cell-free bacterial cultures displayed significant antagonistic activity on Fg-K1-4. Remarkably, heat and proteinase K treatment of bacterial broths did not reduce the antagonistic activity of Bacillus cultures. DON assays showed that Bacillus strain was not affected by the presence of DON in the media. Leaf and head infection assays using Brachypodium distachyon (Bd-21) indicated that EU07 inhibits Fg-K1-4 growth in vivo and promotes plant growth. Overall, the EU07 strain performed better, indicating that it could be explored for the<sep>Root-knot nematodes (RKNs, Meloidogyne spp.) can cause severe yield losses in tomatoes. The Mi-1.2 gene in tomato confers resistance to the Meloidogyne species M. incognita , M. arenaria and M. javanica , which are prevalent in tomato growing areas. However, this resistance breaks down at high soil temperatures (&amp;gt;28°C). Therefore, it is imperative that new resistance sources are identified and incorporated into commercial breeding programmes. We identified a tomato line, MT12, that does not have Mi-1.2 but provides resistance to M. incognita at 32°C soil temperature. An F 2 mapping population was generated by crossing the resistant line with a susceptible line, MT17; the segregation ratio showed that the resistance is conferred by a single dominant gene, designated RRKN1 ( Resistance to Root-Knot Nematode 1 ). The RRKN1 gene was mapped using 111 Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers and characterized. Linkage analysis showed that RRKN1 is located on chromosome 6 and flanking markers placed the locus within a 270 kb interval. These newly developed markers can help pyramiding R -genes<sep>Abstract SlSPL-CNR, an SBP-box transcription factor (TF) gene residing at the epimutant Colourless non-ripening (Cnr) locus, is involved in tomato ripening. This epimutant provides a unique model to investigate the (epi)genetic basis of fruit ripening. Here we report that SlSPL-CNR is a nucleus-localized protein with a distinct monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). It consists of four consecutive residues ‘ 30KRKR33’ at the N-terminus of the protein. Mutation of the NLS abolishes SlSPL-CNR’s ability to localize in the nucleus. SlSPL-CNR comprises two zinc-finger motifs (ZFMs) within the C-terminal SBP-box domain. Both ZFMs contribute to zinc-binding activity. SlSPL-CNR can induce cell death in tomato and tobacco, dependent on its nuclear localization. However, the two ZFMs have differential impacts on SlSPL-CNR’s induction of severe necrosis or mild necrotic ringspot. NLS and ZFM mutants cannot complement Cnr fruits to ripen. SlSPL-CNR interacts with SlSnRK1. Virus-induced SlSnRK1 silencing leads to reduction in expression of ripening-related genes and inhibits ripening in tomato. We conclude that SlSPL-CNR is a multifunctional protein that consists of a distinct monopartite NLS,<sep>Summary Gene silencing exists in eukaryotic organisms as a conserved regulation of the gene expression mechanism. In general, small RNAs (sRNAs) are produced within the eukaryotic cells and incorporated into an RNA‐induced silencing complex (RISC) within cells. However, exogenous sRNAs, once delivered into cells, can also silence target genes via the same RISC. Here, we explored this concept by targeting the Cellulose synthase A3 (CesA3) gene of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis ( Hpa ), the downy mildew pathogen of Arabidopsis thaliana. Hpa spore suspensions were mixed with sense or antisense sRNAs and inoculated onto susceptible Arabidopsis seedlings. While sense sRNAs had no obvious effect on Hpa pathogenicity, antisense sRNAs inhibited spore germination and hence infection. Such inhibition of infection was not race‐specific, but dependent on the length and capping of sRNAs. Inhibition of infection by double stranded sRNA was more efficient than that observed with antisense sRNA. Thus, exogenous sRNA targeting conserved CesA3 could suppress Hpa infection in Arabidopsis , indicating the potential of this simple and efficient sRNA‐based approach for deciphering gene<sep>The fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum (Fg) causes head blight (FHB) disease in cereal crops of small grains such as wheat, rye and barley. These crops represent a great portion of the calorific consumption around the world. The pathogen also produces mycotoxins that are harmful to humans and livestock. Fungicides, integrated pest management, resistant plant varieties and biological control agents have been employed to control FHB. We used three different Bacillus strains: QST713, FZB24 and EU07 to investigate their antagonistic effect on Fg. Although all three Bacillus species suppressed the fungal growth, the EU07 gave the highest suppression. During the studies, we also noticed that these three Bacillus species have different grades of plant growth-promoting (PGP) effect and all of them enhanced the plant defence. However, EU07 showed the highest PGP-activity. This prompted us to carry out a comparative genomic analysis on these bacterial species to identify what makes EU07 superior to others. Our results showed that they are different species and they differ in genes that are involved in the production<sep>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long-distances in animals and plants. This process is genetically determined and requires mobile RNA signals. Genetic requirement and molecular nature of the mobile signals for non-cell-autonomous RNA silencing were intensively investigated in past few decades. No consensus dogma for mobile silencing can be reached in plants, yet published data are sometimes inconsistent and controversial. Thus, the genetic requirements and molecular signals involved in plant mobile silencing are still poorly understood. This article revisits our present understanding of intercellular and systemic non-cell autonomous RNA silencing, and summarises current debates on RNA signals for mobile silencing. In particular, we discuss new evidence on siRNA mobility, a DCL2-dependent genetic network for mobile silencing and its potential biological relevance as well as 22 nt siRNA being a mobile signal for non-cell-autonomous silencing in both Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana. This sets up a new trend in unravelling genetic components and small RNA signal molecules for mobile silencing in (across) plants and other organisms of<sep>Bacillus strains have been used on crop protection on many different crops for long time, due to their PGP activity as well as biological controls of plant diseases. Both characteristics are desirable as a strategy to protect environment since there is a potential contribution in the reduction of pesticide use. We hold three Bacillus strains capable to control Fusarium graminearum growth in vitro. Assays in vivo revealed that, these bacteria interact with Arabidopsis plants to promote a better response to pathogens attack, increase biomass production and modify the flowering time. Plants treated with these Bacillus strains showed significant difference in the level of growth characteristics in comparison to the control. Moreover, we found that these same bacteria, as PGPs, can modulate the flowering time, head number and biomass growth of the small grass Brachypodium distachyon. Lyons et al. (2015) highlighted how the infection by Fusarium oxysporum accelerate the flowering time on Arabidopsis plants. In our system, the pathogen Fusarium graminearum induced some responses on plants but the interaction with the Bacillus<sep>Abstract Virus-induced flowering (VIF) exploits RNA or DNA viruses to express flowering time genes to induce flowering in plants. Such plant virus-based tools have recently attracted widespread attention for their fundamental and applied uses in flowering physiology and in accelerating breeding in dicotyledonous crops and woody fruit-trees. We now extend this technology to a monocot grass and a cereal crop. Using a Foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV)-based VIF system, dubbed FoMViF, we showed that expression of florigenic Flowering Locus T (FT) genes can promote early flowering and spikelet development in proso millet, a C4 grass species with potential as a nutritional food and biofuel resource, and in non-vernalized C3 wheat, a major food crop worldwide. Floral and spikelet/grain induction in the two monocot plants was caused by the virally expressed untagged or FLAG-tagged FT orthologs, and the florigenic activity of rice Hd3a was more pronounced than its dicotyledonous counterparts in proso millet. The FoMViF system is easy to use and its efficacy to induce flowering and early spikelet/grain production is high. In<sep>Summary Arabidopsis Col-0 RPP2A and RPP2B confer recognition of Arabidopsis downy mildew ( Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis [ Hpa ]) isolate Cala2, but the identity of the recognized ATR2 Cala2 effector was unknown. To reveal ATR2 Cala2 , an F 2 population was generated from a cross between Hpa -Cala2 and Hpa -Noks1. We identified ATR2 Cala2 as a non-canonical RxLR-type effector that carries a signal peptide, a dEER motif, and WY domains but no RxLR motif. Recognition of ATR2 Cala2 and its effector function were verified by biolistic bombardment, ectopic expression and Hpa infection. ATR2 Cala2 is recognized in accession Col-0 but not in Ler-0 in which RPP2A and RPP2B are absent. In ATR2 Emoy2 and ATR2 Noks1 alleles, a frameshift results in an early stop codon. RPP2A and RPP2B are essential for the recognition of ATR2 Cala2 . Stable and transient expression of ATR2 Cala2 under 35S promoter in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana enhances disease susceptibility. Two additional Col-0 TIR-NLR (TNL) genes ( RPP2C and RPP2D ) adjacent to RPP2A and<sep>A hallmark of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) is the production of viral small interfering RNA (vsiRNA). Profiling of vsiRNAs indicates that certain regions of viral RNA genome or transcribed viral RNA, dubbed vsiRNA hotspots, are more prone to RNAi-mediated cleavage for vsiRNA biogenesis. However, the biological relevance of hotspot vsiRNAs to the host innate defence against pathogens remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that direct targeting a hotspot by a synthetic vsiRNA confers host resistance to virus infection. Using Northern blotting and RNAseq, we obtained a profile of vsiRNAs of the African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), a single-stranded DNA virus. Sense and anti-sense strands of small RNAs corresponding to a hotspot and a coldspot vsiRNA were synthesised. Co-inoculation of Nicotiana benthamiana with the double-stranded hotspot siRNA protected plants from ACMV infection, where viral DNA replication and accumulation of viral mRNA were undetectable. The sense or anti-sense strand of this hotspot vsiRNA, and the coldspot vsiRNA in both double-stranded and single-stranded formats possessed no activity in viral protection. We further demonstrated<sep>The revolutionary CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology has emerged as a powerful tool for plant improvement, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in making targeted gene modifications. This powerful and practical approach to genome editing offers tremendous opportunities for crop improvement, surpassing the capabilities of conventional breeding techniques. This article provides an overview of recent advancements and challenges associated with the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in plant improvement. The potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in terms of developing crops with enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses is highlighted, with examples of genes edited to confer disease resistance, drought tolerance, salt tolerance, and cold tolerance. Here, we also discuss the importance of off-target effects and the efforts made to mitigate them, including the use of shorter single-guide RNAs and dual Cas9 nickases. Furthermore, alternative delivery methods, such as protein- and RNA-based approaches, are explored, and they could potentially avoid the integration of foreign DNA into the plant genome, thus alleviating concerns related to genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We emphasize the significance of CRISPR/Cas9 in accelerating crop breeding<sep>Cucumber is a widely grown vegetable crop plant and a host to many different plant pathogens. Cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV) causes economic losses on cucumber crops in Mediterranean countries and in some part of India such as West Bengal and in African countries such as Sudan. CVYV is an RNA potyvirus transmitted mechanically and by whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci ) in a semipersistent manner. Control of this virus is heavily dependent on the management of the insect vector and breeding virus-resistant lines. DNA markers have been used widely in conventional plant breeding programs via marker-assisted selection (MAS). However, very few resistance sources against CVYV in cucumber exist, and also the lack of tightly linked molecular markers to these sources restricts the rapid generation of resistant lines. In this work, we used genomics coupled with the bulked segregant analysis method and generated the MAS-friendly Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers suitable for CsCvy-1 selection in cucumber breeding using a segregating F 2 mapping population and commercial plant lines. Variant analysis was<sep>Abstract Sulforaphane (SFN) is an isothiocyanate‐type phytomolecule present in crucifers, which is mainly synthesized in response to biotic stress. In animals, SFN incorporated in the diet has anticancer properties among others. The mechanism of action and signaling are well described in animals; however, little is known in plants. The goal in the present study is to elucidate components of the SFN signaling pathway, particularly the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its effect on the transcriptome. Our results showed that in Arabidopsis , SFN causes ROS production exclusively through the action of the NADPH oxidase RBOH isoform D that requires calcium as a signaling component for the ROS production. To add to this, we also analyzed the effect of SFN on the transcriptome by RNAseq. We observed the highest expression increase for heat shock proteins (HSP) genes and also for genes associated with the response to oxidative stress. The upregulation of several genes linked to the biotic stress response confirms the interplay between SFN and this stress. In addition, SFN<sep>Downy mildews are obligate oomycete pathogens that attack a wide range of plants and can cause significant economic impacts on commercial crops and ornamental plants. Traditionally, downy mildew disease control relied on an integrated strategies, that incorporate cultural practices, deployment of resistant cultivars, crop rotation, application of contact and systemic pesticides, and biopesticides. Recent advances in genomics provided data that significantly advanced understanding of downy mildew evolution, taxonomy and classification. In addition, downy mildew genomics also revealed that these obligate oomycetes have reduced numbers of virulence factor genes in comparison to hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic oomycetes. However, downy mildews do deploy significant arrays of virulence proteins, including so-called RXLR proteins that promote virulence or are recognized as avirulence factors. Pathogenomics are being applied to downy mildew population studies to determine the genetic diversity within the downy mildew populations and manage disease by selection of appropriate varieties and management strategies. Genome editing technologies have been used to manipulate host disease susceptibility genes in different plants including grapevine and sweet basil and thereby provide<sep>Abstract Disease development in plants requires a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and a favourable environment. Oomycete pathogens cause many important diseases and have evolved sophisticated molecular mechanisms to manipulate their hosts. Day length has been shown to impact plant–oomycete interactions but a need exists for a tractable reference system to understand the mechanistic interplay between light regulation, oomycete pathogen virulence, and plant host immunity. Here we present data demonstrating that light is a critical factor in the interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and its naturally occurring downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). We investigated the role of light on spore germination, mycelium development, sporulation, and oospore formation of Hpa, along with defence responses in the host. We observed abundant Hpa sporulation on compatible Arabidopsis under day lengths ranging from 10 to 14 hr. In contrast, exposure to constant light or constant dark suppressed sporulation.

Currently, two vaccine technologies against S. pneumoniae are used: the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, one of which is the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) that has recently been approved for adults. Objective This study was conducted to investigate the cost-effectiveness of implementing PCV20 in a reimbursement scheme for Norwegian adults aged 18–99 years at risk of pneumococcal diseases and those aged 65 years and older at low risk compared to PPV23. Methods An established Markov model was adapted to a Norwegian setting to estimate the economic and clinical consequences of vaccinating the Norwegian population in specific age and risk groups against pneumococcal diseases. Inputs for the model were found in Norwegian or Danish real-world evidence or retrieved from available studies. The costs and clinical outcomes were assessed using a health sector perspective and a lifetime time horizon. Results The results showed that PCV20<sep>ABSTRACT Drought stress poses a significant threat to wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) cultivation, necessitating an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning drought response in both tolerant and sensitive varieties. In this study, 12 diverse bread wheat cultivars were evaluated for their drought stress responses, with particular emphasis on the contrasting performance of cultivars Atay 85 (sensitive), Gerek 79, and Müfitbey (tolerant). Transcriptomic analysis was performed on the root and leaf tissues of the aforementioned cultivars subjected to 4-hour and 8-hour drought stress and compared with controls. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were categorized based on their cellular component, molecular function, and biological function. Notably, there was greater gene expression variability in leaf tissues compared to root tissues. A noticeable trend of decreased gene expression was observed for cellular processes such as protein refolding and cellular metabolic processes like photorespiration as drought stress duration increased (8 hours) in the leaf tissues of drought-tolerant and sensitive cultivars. Metabolic processes related to gene expression were predominantly activated in response to 4-hour and 8-hour</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Ageing<sep>Psychological intervention<sep>Healthy ageing<sep>Nuclear pore<sep>Fluorescent protein<sep>Longevity<sep>Caenorhabditis elegans<sep>Fluorescence<sep>Green fluorescent protein<sep>Movement (music)</keyword><title>Imaging Fluorescent Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins in C. elegans<sep>Measuring<i>C. elegans</i>Ageing Through Non-Invasive Monitoring of Movement across Large Populations<sep>Rapid measurement of ageing by automated monitoring of movement of C. elegans populations</title><abstract>C. elegans is a well-characterized and relatively simple model organism, making it attractive for studying nuclear pore complex proteins in cell and developmental biology.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , offers a rapid in vivo method to determine whether a compound extends its 2-3 week lifespan. However, the standard C. elegans lifespan assay is hard to scale for large screens. Lifespan analysis produces only one data point per animal with no information about health. Here we describe automated monitoring of movement from early to mid-adulthood as a healthspan-based alternative to measure ageing. Using our WormGazer™ technology, over 100 petri dishes containing C. elegans worms are imaged simultaneously and non-invasively by an array of cameras. This approach demonstrates that most functional decline in C. elegans occurs during the first week of adulthood. We find 7 days of imaging is sufficient to measure the dose-dependent efficacy of sulfamethoxazole to slow ageing, compared to 40 days required for a parallel lifespan experiment. Understanding any negative consequences of interventions that slow ageing is important. We show that the long-lived mutant age-1(hx546) stays active for longer than the wild type but it moves slower in early adulthood. Thus, continuous analysis of movement can rapidly identify interventions that slow ageing while simultaneously revealing any negative effects on health.<sep>Finding new interventions that slow ageing and maintain human health is a huge challenge of our time.

As signalling strategy conserved in all domains of life, it modulates substrate activity, localisation, stability or interactions, thereby regulating a variety of cellular processes and microbial pathogenicity. Yet over the last years, there is increasing evidence of non-canonical forms of ADP-ribosylation that are catalysed by certain members of the ADP-ribosyltransferase family and go beyond traditional protein ADP-ribosylation signalling. New macromolecular targets such as nucleic acids and new ADP-ribose derivatives have been established, notably extending the repertoire of ADP-ribosylation signalling. Based on the physiological relevance known so far, non-canonical ADP-ribosylation deserves its recognition next to the traditional protein ADP-ribosylation modification and which we therefore review in the following.<sep>The worldwide public health and socioeconomic consequences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the importance of increasing preparedness for viral disease outbreaks by providing rapid disease prevention and treatment strategies. The NSP3 macrodomain of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 is among the viral protein repertoire that was identified as a potential target for the development of antiviral agents, due to its critical role in viral replication and consequent pathogenicity in the host. By combining virtual and biophysical screening efforts, we discovered several experimental small molecules and FDA-approved drugs as inhibitors of the NSP3 macrodomain. Analogue characterisation of the hit matter and crystallographic studies confirming binding modes, including that of the antibiotic compound aztreonam, to the active site of the macrodomain provide valuable structure-activity relationship information that support current approaches and open up new avenues for NSP3 macrodomain inhibitor development.<sep>PARP1, an established anti-cancer target that regulates many cellular pathways, including DNA repair signaling, has been intensely studied for decades as a poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase. Although recent studies have revealed the prevalence of mono-ADP-ribosylation upon DNA damage, it was unknown whether this signal plays an active role in the cell or is just a byproduct of poly-ADP-ribosylation. By engineering SpyTag-based modular antibodies for sensitive and flexible detection of mono-ADP-ribosylation, including fluorescence-based sensors for live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that serine mono-ADP-ribosylation constitutes a second wave of PARP1 signaling shaped by the cellular HPF1/PARP1 ratio. Multilevel chromatin proteomics reveals histone mono-ADP-ribosylation readers, including RNF114, a ubiquitin ligase recruited to DNA lesions through a zinc-finger domain, modulating the DNA damage response and telomere maintenance. Our work provides a technological framework for illuminating ADP-ribosylation in a wide range of applications and biological contexts and establishes mono-ADP-ribosylation by HPF1/PARP1 as an important information carrier for cell signaling.<sep>Fragment-based drug design has introduced a bottom-up process for drug development, with improved sampling of chemical space and increased effectiveness in early drug discovery. Here, we combine the use of pharmacophores, the most general concept of representing drug-target interactions with the theory of protein hotspots, to develop a design protocol for fragment libraries. The SpotXplorer approach compiles small fragment libraries that maximize the coverage of experimentally confirmed binding pharmacophores at the most preferred hotspots. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated with a pilot library of 96 fragment-sized compounds (SpotXplorer0) that is validated on popular target classes and emerging drug targets. Biochemical screening against a set of GPCRs and proteases retrieves compounds containing an average of 70% of known pharmacophores for these targets. More importantly, SpotXplorer0 screening identifies confirmed hits against recently established challenging targets such as the histone methyltransferase SETD2, the main protease (3CLPro) and the NSP3 macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2.<sep>PARP14 is a mono–ADP-ribosyl transferase involved in the control of immunity, transcription, and DNA replication stress management. However, little is known about the ADP-ribosylation activity of PARP14, including its substrate specificity or how PARP14-dependent ADP-ribosylation is reversed. We show that PARP14 is a dual-function enzyme with both ADP-ribosyl transferase and hydrolase activity acting on both protein and nucleic acid substrates. In particular, we show that the PARP14 macrodomain 1 is an active ADP-ribosyl hydrolase. We also demonstrate hydrolytic activity for the first macrodomain of PARP9. We reveal that expression of a PARP14 mutant with the inactivated macrodomain 1 results in a marked increase in mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins in human cells, including PARP14 itself and antiviral PARP13, and displays specific cellular phenotypes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the closely related hydrolytically active macrodomain of SARS2 Nsp3, Mac1, efficiently reverses PARP14 ADP-ribosylation in vitro and in cells, supporting the evolution of viral macrodomains to counteract PARP14-mediated antiviral response.<sep>Viral macrodomains possess the ability to counteract host ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification implicated in the creation of an antiviral environment via immune response regulation. This brought them into focus as promising therapeutic targets, albeit the close homology to some of the human macrodomains raised concerns regarding potential cross-reactivity and adverse effects for the host. Here, we evaluate the structure and function of the macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We show that it can antagonize ADP-ribosylation by PARP14, a cellular (ADP-ribosyl)transferase necessary for the restriction of coronaviral infections. Furthermore, our structural studies together with ligand modelling revealed the structural basis for poly(ADP-ribose) binding and hydrolysis, an emerging new aspect of viral macrodomain biology. These new insights were used in an extensive evolutionary analysis aimed at evaluating the druggability of viral macrodomains not only from the Coronaviridae but also Togaviridae and Iridoviridae genera (causing diseases such as Chikungunya and infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus disease, respectively). We found that they contain conserved features, distinct from their human counterparts, which may be exploited during drug design.<sep>The nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains a conserved macrodomain enzyme (Mac1) that is critical for pathogenesis and lethality. While small-molecule inhibitors of Mac1 have great therapeutic potential, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no well-validated inhibitors for this protein nor, indeed, the macrodomain enzyme family, making this target a pharmacological orphan. Here, we report the structure-based discovery and development of several different chemical scaffolds exhibiting low- to sub-micromolar affinity for Mac1 through iterations of computer-aided design, structural characterization by ultra-high-resolution protein crystallography, and binding evaluation. Potent scaffolds were designed with in silico fragment linkage and by ultra-large library docking of over 450 million molecules. Both techniques leverage the computational exploration of tangible chemical space and are applicable to other pharmacological orphans. Overall, 160 ligands in 119 different scaffolds were discovered, and 153 Mac1-ligand complex crystal structures were determined, typically to 1 Å resolution or better. Our analyses discovered selective and cell-permeable molecules, unexpected ligand-mediated conformational changes within the active site, and key inhibitor motifs that will template future drug development against Mac1.<sep>ADP-ribosylation is an ancient, highly conserved, and reversible covalent modification critical for a variety of endogenous processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. ADP-ribosylation targets proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules (including antibiotics). ADP-ribosylation signalling involves enzymes that add ADP-ribose to the target molecule, the (ADP-ribosyl)transferases; and those that remove it, the (ADP-ribosyl)hydrolases. Recently, the toxin/antitoxin pair DarT/DarG composed of a DNA ADP-ribosylating toxin, DarT, and (ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase antitoxin, DarG, was described. DarT modifies thymidine in single-stranded DNA in a sequence-specific manner while DarG reverses this modification, thereby rescuing cells from DarT toxicity. We studied the DarG homologue SCO6735 which is highly conserved in all Streptomyces species and known to be associated with antibiotic production in the bacterium S. coelicolor. SCO6735 shares a high structural similarity with the bacterial DarG and human TARG1. Like DarG and TARG1, SCO6735 can also readily reverse thymidine-linked ADP-ribosylation catalysed by DarT in vitro and in cells. SCO6735 active site analysis including molecular dynamic simulations of its complex with ADP-ribosylated thymidine suggests a novel catalytic mechanism of DNA-(ADP-ribose) hydrolysis. Moreover, a comparison of SCO6735 structure with ALC1-like homologues revealed an evolutionarily conserved feature characteristic for this subclass of macrodomain hydrolases.<sep>Abstract AlphaFold2 and related computational tools have greatly aided studies of structural biology through their ability to accurately predict protein structures. In the present work, we explored AF2 structural models of the 17 canonical members of the human PARP protein family and supplemented this analysis with new experiments and an overview of recent published data. PARP proteins are typically involved in the modification of proteins and nucleic acids through mono or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, but this function can be modulated by the presence of various auxiliary protein domains. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of the structured domains and long intrinsically disordered regions within human PARPs, offering a revised basis for understanding the function of these proteins. Among other functional insights, the study provides a model of PARP1 domain dynamics in the DNA-free and DNA-bound states and enhances the connection between ADP-ribosylation and RNA biology and between ADP-ribosylation and ubiquitin-like modifications by predicting putative RNA-binding domains and E2-related RWD domains in certain PARPs. In line with the bioinformatic analysis, we demonstrate for the first time PARP14’s RNA-binding capability and RNA ADP-ribosylation activity in vitro. While our insights align with existing experimental data and are probably accurate, they need further validation through experiments.<sep>Abstract The process of finding molecules that bind to a target protein is a challenging first step in drug discovery. Crystallographic fragment screening is a strategy based on elucidating binding modes of small polar compounds and then building potency by expanding or merging them. Recent advances in high-throughput crystallography enable screening of large fragment libraries, reading out dense ensembles of fragments spanning the binding site. However, fragments typically have low affinity thus the road to potency is often long and fraught with false starts. Here, we take advantage of high-throughput crystallography to reframe fragment-based hit discovery as a denoising problem – identifying significant pharmacophore distributions from a fragment ensemble amid noise due to weak binders – and employ an unsupervised machine learning method to tackle this problem. Our method screens potential molecules by evaluating whether they recapitulate those fragment-derived pharmacophore distributions. We retrospectively validated our approach on an open science campaign against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), showing that our method can distinguish active compounds from inactive ones using only structural data of fragment-protein complexes, without any activity data. Further, we prospectively found novel hits for Mpro and the Mac1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3. More broadly, our results demonstrate how unsupervised machine learning helps interpret high throughput crystallography data to rapidly discover of potent chemical modulators of protein function.<sep>ADP-ribosyltransferases use NAD+ to catalyse substrate ADP-ribosylation1, and thereby regulate cellular pathways or contribute to toxin-mediated pathogenicity of bacteria2-4. Reversible ADP-ribosylation has traditionally been considered a protein-specific modification5, but recent in vitro studies have suggested nucleic acids as targets6-9. Here we present evidence that specific, reversible ADP-ribosylation of DNA on thymidine bases occurs in cellulo through the DarT-DarG toxin-antitoxin system, which is found in a variety of bacteria (including global pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa)10. We report the structure of DarT, which identifies this protein as a diverged member of the PARP family. We provide a set of high-resolution structures of this enzyme in ligand-free and pre- and post-reaction states, which reveals a specialized mechanism of catalysis that includes a key active-site arginine that extends the canonical ADP-ribosyltransferase toolkit. Comparison with PARP-HPF1, a well-established DNA repair protein ADP-ribosylation complex, offers insights into how the DarT class of ADP-ribosyltransferases evolved into specific DNA-modifying enzymes. Together, our structural and mechanistic data provide details of this PARP family member and contribute to a fundamental understanding of the ADP-ribosylation of nucleic acids. We also show that thymine-linked ADP-ribose DNA adducts reversed by DarG antitoxin (functioning as a noncanonical DNA repair factor) are used not only for targeted DNA damage to induce toxicity, but also as a signalling strategy for cellular processes. Using M. tuberculosis as an exemplar, we show that DarT-DarG regulates growth by ADP-ribosylation of DNA at the origin of chromosome replication.<sep>L’association de réflexion sur le parcours de soins en milieu respiratoire (APSR) est une association loi 1901 créée en 2014 à l’initiative de pneumologues libéraux.

Here, we report a multi-laboratory study to test whether heterogenization of study populations by using animals from different breeders increases the replicability of results from single-laboratory studies. We found that heterogenization by breeder was not potent enough to increase external validity sufficiently to improve replicability.<sep>Females have a two-fold increase in risk for developing anxiety compared to males. Animal studies of anxiety have used primarily male animals, so the mechanisms underlying this sex-specific risk are unknown. Previous research from our lab has explored the role of sex-hormone fluctuations in female-specific psychiatric risk. This study expands on previous findings by exploring the role of Egr1 in driving a ventral hippocampal transcriptional program associated with hormone-dependent changes in behavioral phenotypes.<sep>Abstract Male and female brains differ significantly in both health and disease, and yet the female brain has been understudied. Sex-hormone fluctuations make the female brain particularly dynamic and are likely to confer female-specific risks for neuropsychiatric disorders. The molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamic nature of the female brain structure and function are unknown. Here we show that neuronal chromatin organization in the female ventral hippocampus of mouse fluctuates with the oestrous cycle. We find chromatin organizational changes associated with the transcriptional activity of genes important for neuronal function and behaviour. We link these chromatin dynamics to variation in anxiety-related behaviour and brain structure. Our findings implicate an immediate-early gene product, Egr1, as part of the mechanism mediating oestrous cycle-dependent chromatin and transcriptional changes. This study reveals extreme, sex-specific dynamism of the neuronal epigenome, and establishes a foundation for the development of sex-specific treatments for disorders such as anxiety and depression.<sep>Early-life stress and ovarian hormones contribute to increased female vulnerability to cocaine addiction. Here, we reveal molecular substrates in the reward area, the nucleus accumbens, through which these female-specific factors affect immediate and conditioning responses to cocaine. We find shared involvement of X chromosome inactivation-related and estrogen signaling-related gene regulation in enhanced conditioning responses following early-life stress and during the low-estrogenic state in females. Low-estrogenic females respond to acute cocaine by opening neuronal chromatin enriched for the sites of ΔFosB, a transcription factor implicated in chronic cocaine response and addiction. Conversely, high-estrogenic females respond to cocaine by preferential chromatin closing, providing a mechanism for limiting cocaine-driven chromatin and synaptic plasticity. We find that physiological estrogen withdrawal, early-life stress, and absence of one X chromosome all nullify the protective effect of a high-estrogenic state on cocaine conditioning in females. Our findings offer a molecular framework to enable understanding of sex-specific neuronal mechanisms underlying cocaine use disorder.<sep>The validity of widely used rodent behavioural tests of anxiety has been questioned, as they often fail to produce consistent results across independent replicate studies. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of common behavioural tests of anxiety in mice to detect anxiolytic effects of drugs prescribed to treat anxiety in humans. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review of 814 studies reporting effects of 25 anxiolytic compounds using common behavioural tests for anxiety. Meta-analyses of effect sizes of treatments showed that only two out of 17 commonly used test measures reliably detected effects of anxiolytic compounds. We report considerable between-study variation in size and even direction of effects of most anxiolytics on most outcome variables. Our findings indicate a general lack of sensitivity of those behavioural tests and cast serious doubt on both construct and predictive validity of most of these tests. In view of scientifically valid and ethically responsible research, we call for a revision of behavioural tests of anxiety in mice and the development of more predictive tests.<sep>Context-dependent biological variation presents a unique challenge to the reproducibility of results in experimental animal research, because organisms’ responses to experimental treatments can vary with both genotype and environmental conditions. In March 2019, experts in animal biology, experimental design and statistics convened in Blonay, Switzerland, to discuss strategies addressing this challenge. In contrast to the current gold standard of rigorous standardization in experimental animal research, we recommend the use of systematic heterogenization of study samples and conditions by actively incorporating biological variation into study design through diversifying study samples and conditions. Here we provide the scientific rationale for this approach in the hope that researchers, regulators, funders and editors can embrace this paradigm shift. We also present a road map towards better practices in view of improving the reproducibility of animal research. In this Perspective, Hanno Würbel and colleagues argue that a disregard for incorporating biological variation in study design is an important cause of poor reproducibility in animal research. They put the case for the use of systematic heterogenization of study samples and conditions in studies to improve reproducibility.<sep>Soy isoflavone genistein interplays with numerous physiological or pathophysiological processes during ageing. However, its protective role and underlying mechanisms of action in the regulation of calcium (Ca2+) and phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in an animal model of the andropause are yet to be fully clarified. Wistar male rats (16-month-old) were divided into sham-operated, orchidectomized, orchidectomized estradiol-treated (0.625 mg/kg b.m./day) and orchidectomized genistein-treated (30 mg/kg b.m./day) groups. Treatments were administered subcutaneously for 3 weeks, while the controls received vehicle alone. Estradiol treatment increased the expression level of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R), and activated mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK 1/2) signaling pathway in the kidneys. Genistein application induced a prominent gene and protein expression of Klotho and downregulated the expression of FGFR and PTH1R in the kidney of andropausal rats. Activation of protein kinase B (Akt) signalling pathway was observed, while MEK 1/2 signaling pathway wasn't altered after genistein treatment. The increase of 25 (OH) vitamin D in the serum and decrease in Ca2+ urine content was observed after genistein application. Our findings strongly suggest genistein as a potent biocompound with beneficial effects on the regulation of Ca2+ and Pi homeostasis, especially during aging process when the balance of mineral metabolism is impaired. These novel data provide closer insights into the physiological roles of genistein in the regulation of mineral homeostasis.<sep>A growing population of elderly people consume citrus flavanones, naringenin, and hesperetin in the form of fruits or juices. Flavanones are bioactives with potent antioxidant properties and have potential in slowing down the aging process. Because flavanones exert controversial effects on pituitary–thyroid functioning, our study on the old-aged rat model aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which naringenin and hesperetin affect this axis. Naringenin and hesperetin increased the Sirt1 mRNA level by 91 and 71% (p < 0.05), which was followed by increased Sirt1 expression by 20 and 15% (p < 0.05), respectively. Only naringenin decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone expression by 20% (p < 0.05). Thyroid peroxidase protein expression was upregulated after naringenin or hesperetin by 62 and 43% (p < 0.05), respectively. Naringenin lowered mRNA levels of Tpo, Sod1, Sod2, Cat, and Nrf2 by 50, 32, 45, 35, and 42% (p < 0.05), respectively, and increased Gpx by 54% (p < 0.05), while hesperetin decreased Sod1 and Sod2 mRNA levels by 46 and 55% (p < 0.05), respectively. Naringenin increased the protein expressions of Nrf2 and SOD2 by 58 and 50% (p < 0.05), respectively, and decreased SOD1 expression by 48% (p < 0.05), while hesperetin protein decreased expressions of SOD1 and Nrf2 by 63 and 32% (p < 0.05), respectively. Altogether, our findings suggest that citrus flavanones contribute to restoring the impaired thyroid functioning in the old-aged rats.<sep>Abstract Theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that low external validity due to rigorous standardization of study populations is a cause of poor replicability in animal research. Here we report a multi-laboratory study aimed at investigating whether heterogenization of study populations by using animals from different breeding sites increases the replicability of results from single-laboratory studies. We used male C57BL/6J mice from six different breeding sites to test a standardized against a heterogenized (HET) study design in six independent replicate test laboratories. For the standardized design, each laboratory ordered mice from a single breeding site (each laboratory from a different one), while for the HET design, each laboratory ordered proportionate numbers of mice from the five remaining breeding sites. To test our hypothesis, we assessed 14 outcome variables, including body weight, behavioral measures obtained from a single session on an elevated plus maze, and clinical blood parameters. Both breeding site and test laboratory affected variation in outcome variables, but the effect of test laboratory was more pronounced for most outcome variables. Moreover, heterogenization of study populations by breeding site (HET) did not reduce variation in outcome variables between test laboratories, which was most likely due to the fact that breeding site had only little effect on variation in outcome variables, thereby limiting the scope for HET to reduce between-lab variation. We conclude that heterogenization of study populations by breeding site has limited capacity for improving the replicability of results from single-laboratory animal studies.<sep>Recently, many funding agencies have released guidelines on the importance of considering sex as a biological variable (SABV) as an experimental factor, aiming to address sex differences and avoid possible sex biases to enhance the reproducibility and translational relevance of preclinical research. In neuroscience and pharmacology, the female sex is often omitted from experimental designs, with researchers generalizing male-driven outcomes to both sexes, risking a biased or limited understanding of disease mechanisms and thus potentially ineffective therapeutics. Herein, we describe key methodological aspects that should be considered when sex is factored into in vitro and in vivo experiments and provide practical knowledge for researchers to incorporate SABV into preclinical research. Both age and sex significantly influence biological and behavioral processes due to critical changes at different timepoints of development for males and females and due to hormonal fluctuations across the rodent lifespan. We show that including both sexes does not require larger sample sizes, and even if sex is included as an independent variable in the study design, a moderate increase in sample size is sufficient. Moreover, the importance of tracking hormone levels in both sexes and the differentiation between sex differences and sex-related strategy in behaviors are explained. Finally, the lack of robust data on how biological sex influences the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), or toxicological effects of various preclinically administered drugs to animals due to the exclusion of female animals is discussed, and methodological strategies to enhance the rigor and translational relevance of<sep>The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is becoming popular in the neuroscience field where chromatin regulation is thought to be involved in neurodevelopment, activity-dependent gene regulation, hormonal and environmental responses, and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. The advantages of using ATAC-seq include a small amount of material needed, fast protocol, and the ability to capture a range of gene regulatory elements with a single assay. With increasing interest in chromatin research, it is an imperative to have feasible, reliable assays that are compatible with a range of neuroscience study designs. Here we tested three protocols for neuronal chromatin accessibility analysis, including a varying brain tissue freezing method followed by fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) and ATAC-seq. Our study shows that the cryopreservation method impacts the number of open chromatin regions identified from frozen brain tissue using ATAC-seq. However, we show that all protocols generate consistent and robust data and enable the identification of functional regulatory elements in neuronal cells. Our study implies that the broad biological interpretation of chromatin accessibility data is not significantly affected by the freezing condition. We also reveal additional challenges of doing chromatin analysis on post-mortem human brain tissue. Overall, ATAC-seq coupled with FANS is a powerful method to capture cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility information in mouse and human brain. Our study provides alternative brain preservation methods that generate high-quality ATAC-seq data while fitting in different study designs, and further encourages the use of this method to uncover the role of<sep>The phenotype of an organism results from its genotype and the influence of the environment throughout development. Even when using animals of the same genotype, independent studies may test animals of different phenotypes, resulting in poor replicability due to genotype-by-environment interactions. Thus, genetically defined strains of mice may respond differently to experimental treatments depending on their rearing environment. However, the extent of such phenotypic plasticity and its implications for the replicability of research findings have remained unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which common environmental differences between animal facilities modulate the phenotype of genetically homogeneous (inbred) mice. We conducted a comprehensive multicentre study, whereby inbred C57BL/6J mice from a single breeding cohort were allocated to and reared in 5 different animal facilities throughout early life and adolescence, before being transported to a single test laboratory. We found persistent effects of the rearing facility on the composition and heterogeneity of the gut microbial community. These effects were paralleled by persistent differences in body weight and in the behavioural phenotype of the mice. Furthermore, we show that environmental variation among animal facilities is strong enough to influence epigenetic patterns in neurons at the level of chromatin organisation. We detected changes in chromatin organisation in the regulatory regions of genes involved in nucleosome assembly, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of behaviour. Our findings demonstrate that common environmental differences between animal facilities may produce facility-specific phenotypes, from the molecular to the behavioural level. Furthermore, they highlight an<sep>In a rat model of the andropause we aimed to examine the influence of daidzein, soy isoflavone, on the structure and function of parathyroid glands (PTG) and the expression levels of some of the crucial regulators of Ca2+ and Pi homeostasis in the kidney, and to compare these effects with the effects of estradiol, serving as a positive control. Middle-aged (16-month-old) male Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: sham-operated (SO), orchidectomized (Orx), orchidectomized and estradiol-treated (Orx + E; 0.625 mg/kg b.w./day, s.c.) as well as orchidectomized and daidzein-treated (Orx + D; 30 mg/kg b.w./day, s.c.) group. Every treated group had a corresponding control group. PTH serum concentration was decreased in Orx + E and Orx + D groups by 10% and 21% (p < 0.05) respectively, in comparison with the Orx. PTG volume was decreased in Orx + E group by 16% (p < 0.05), when compared to the Orx. In Orx + E group expression of NaPi 2a was lower (p < 0.05), while NaPi 2a abundance in Orx + D animals was increased (p < 0.05), when compared to Orx. Expression of PTH1R was increased (p < 0.05) in Orx + E group, while in Orx + D animals the same parameter was decreased (p < 0.05), in comparison with Orx. Klotho expression was elevated (p < 0.05) in Orx + D rats, in regard to Orx. Orx + D induced reduction in Ca2+/creatinine and Pi/creatinine ratio in urine by 32%<sep>Studies in mice have shown that less aversive handling methods (e.g. tunnel or cup handling) can reduce behavioural measures of anxiety in comparison to picking mice up by their tail. Despite such evidence, tail handling continues to be used routinely. Besides resistance to change accustomed procedures, this may also be due to the fact that current evidence in support of less aversive handling is mostly restricted to effects of extensive daily handling, which may not apply to routine husbandry practices. The aim of our study was to assess whether, and to what extent, different handling methods during routine husbandry induce differences in behavioural and physiological measures of stress in laboratory mice. To put the effects of handling method in perspective with chronic stress, we compared handling methods to a validated paradigm of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). We housed mice of two strains (Balb/c and C57BL/6) and both sexes either under standard laboratory conditions (CTRL) or under UCMS. Half of the animals from each housing condition were tail handled and half were tunnel handled twice per week, once during a cage change and once for a routine health check. We found strain dependent effects of handling method on behavioural measures of anxiety: tunnel handled Balb/c mice interacted with the handler more than tail handled conspecifics, and tunnel handled CTRL mice showed increased open arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze. Mice undergoing UCMS showed increased plasma corticosterone levels and reduced sucrose preference. However, we found no<sep>Stress during sensitive developmental periods can adversely affect physical and psychological development and contribute to later-life mental disorders. In particular, adverse experiences during childhood dramatically increase the risk for the development of depression and anxiety disorders. Although women of reproductive age are twice as likely to develop anxiety and depression than men of the corresponding age, little is known about sex-specific factors that promote or protect against the development of psychopathology. To examine potential developmental mechanisms driving sex disparity in risk for anxiety and depression, we established a two-hit developmental stress model including maternal separation in early life followed by social isolation in adolescence. Our study shows complex interactions between early-life and adolescent stress, between stress and sex, and between stress and female estrogen status in shaping behavioral phenotypes of adult animals. In general, increased locomotor activity and body weight reduction were the only two phenotypes where two stressors showed synergistic activity. In terms of anxiety- and depression-related phenotypes, single exposure to early-life stress had the most significant impact and was female-specific. We show that early-life stress disrupts the protective role of estrogen in females, and promotes female vulnerability to anxiety- and depression-related phenotypes associated with the low-estrogenic state. We found plausible transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in psychiatric risk genes, Nr3c1 and Cacna1c, that likely contributed to the stress-induced behavioral effects. In addition, two general transcriptional regulators, Egr1 and Dnmt1, were found to be dysregulated in maternally-separated females and in animals exposed to both stressors,<sep>Stress during sensitive developmental periods can adversely affect physical and psychological development and contribute to later-life mental disorders.

However, the validity of widely used rodent behavioural tests of anxiety has repeatedly been questioned, as they often fail to produce consistent results across independent replicate studies using different study populations or different anxiolytic compounds. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of behavioural tests of anxiety in mice to detect anxiolytic effects of drugs prescribed to treat anxiety in humans. To this end, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review of studies reporting tests of anxiolytic compounds against a control treatment using common behavioural tests of anxiety in mice. PubMed and EMBASE were searched on August 21 st 2019 for studies published in English and 814 papers were identified for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed based on Syrcle’s risk of bias tool and the Camarades study quality checklist on a randomly selected subsample of 180 papers. Meta-analyses on effect sizes of treatments using standardized mean differences (Hedges’ g) showed that only two of 17 test measures reliably detected effects of anxiolytic compounds other than diazepam. Further, we report considerable variation in both direction and size of effects of most anxiolytics on most outcome variables, indicating poor replicability of test results. This was corroborated by high heterogeneity in most test measures. Finally, we found an overall high risk of bias.

Since steering events are the primary reason for lane departure, in this paper, a data-based departure warning algorithm is proposed that uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect the lane departure state. In the HMM, the current steering event is the hidden state, and the driving state information is the observed sequence. The parameters of the HMM can be trained using the driving dataset of the driver. In addition, a further judgement strategy is used to distinguish between intentional and unintentional departure to avoid false alerts. Finally, based on a reasonable time window for identification, experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm and the time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) algorithm. Quantitative analyses of the experimental results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the data-based algorithm.<sep>Intelligent vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) need to have proper awareness of the traffic context, as well as the driver status since ADAS share the vehicle control authorities with the human driver. This paper provides an overview of the ego-vehicle driver intention inference (DII), which mainly focuses on the lane change intention on highways. First, a human intention mechanism is discussed in the beginning to gain an overall understanding of the driver intention. Next, the ego-vehicle driver intention is classified into different categories based on various criteria. A complete DII system can be separated into different modules, which consist of traffic context awareness, driver states monitoring, and the vehicle dynamic measurement module. The relationship between these modules and the corresponding impacts on the DII are analyzed. Then, the lane change intention inference system is reviewed from the perspective of input signals, algorithms, and evaluation. Finally, future concerns and emerging trends in this area are highlighted.<sep>A prescribed performance neural controller to guarantee tracking quality is addressed for the near space kinetic kill vehicle (NSKKV) to meet the state constraints caused by side window detection. Different from the traditional prescribed performance control in which the shape of the performance function is constant, this paper exploits new performance functions which can change the shape of their function according to different symbols of initial errors and can ensure the error convergence with a small overshoot. The neural backstepping control and the minimal learning parameters (MLP) technology are employed for exploring a prescribed performance controller (PPC) that provides robust tracking attitude reference trajectories. The highlight is that the transient performance of tracking errors is satisfactory and the computational load of neural approximation is low. The pseudo rate (PSR) modulator is used to shape the continuous control command to pulse or on-off signals to meet the requirements of the thruster. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method can achieve state constraints, pseudo-linear operation and high accuracy.<sep>Intelligent vehicle positioning is an enabling technology for decision-making, trajectory planning, and motion control, and is a key technology in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In order to obtain a low-cost and high-precision positioning strategy, an integrated positioning strategy for intelligent vehicles based on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), dead reckoning (DR), ultra-wide band (UWB), and visual map matching (VMM) was proposed in this paper. First, the error sources of the three independent positioning methods of GNSS, DR, and UWB were analyzed, and independent positioning algorithms with improved accuracy were proposed. Then, the fusion positioning algorithm of GNSS/DR/UWB with an adaptive information distribution coefficient was established using a federated Kalman filter to improve the positioning accuracy and continuity. Afterward, to avoid reliance on the previous moment, the positioning result was further corrected by VMM. Finally, offline simulation and real vehicle tests were conducted under typical working conditions with the impact of real-world noise and the real-motion states of vehicles. The results showed that the GNSS/UWB/DR/VMM positioning algorithm could effectively improve the positioning accuracy and reliability of intelligent vehicles at a low cost.<sep>There have been explosive developments in automatic driving in recent years. Several kinds of self-driving vehicles have been introduced, but drivers are generally required to stay alert and put their hands on the steering wheel during automatic driving, which means the vehicle is in a state of human-machine cooperative control. Hence personalization is needed to reduce conflicts between driver and machine. To achieve personalized automatic driving, a combined hierarchy learning framework (CHLF) based on gated recurrent units (GRU) and safety field is developed in this paper. Learning-based methods are gaining attention in the development of automatic vehicles. However, automatic driving based on neural networks is risky due to poor interpretability. To overcome this limitation, we divided the network into three layers according to function to achieve a hierarchy. We combine data- and mechanism-oriented methods to make the CHLF reliable and stable. Lane-changing (LC) driving data collected from real-vehicle field experiments are used to train the CHLF, which learns from the data to capture human driver behavior in LC. To verify the performance of the CHLF, a group of driver-in-the-loop experiments is conducted based on a driving simulation test bench. The results show that the CHLF can reduce driver steering output torque compared to the conventional method, which means there is less conflict between driver and machine during automatic LC, and the driver is more relaxed.<sep>Driver decisions and behaviors are essential factors that can affect the driving safety. To understand the driver behaviors, a driver activities recognition system is designed based on the deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in this paper. Specifically, seven common driving activities are identified, which are the normal driving, right mirror checking, rear mirror checking, left mirror checking, using in-vehicle radio device, texting, and answering the mobile phone, respectively. Among these activities, the first four are regarded as normal driving tasks, while the rest three are classified into the distraction group. The experimental images are collected using a low-cost camera, and ten drivers are involved in the naturalistic data collection. The raw images are segmented using the Gaussian mixture model to extract the driver body from the background before training the behavior recognition CNN model. To reduce the training cost, transfer learning method is applied to fine tune the pre-trained CNN models. Three different pre-trained CNN models, namely, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50 are adopted and evaluated. The detection results for the seven tasks achieved an average of 81.6% accuracy using the AlexNet, 78.6% and 74.9% accuracy using the GoogLeNet and ResNet50, respectively. Then, the CNN models are trained for the binary classification task and identify whether the driver is being distracted or not. The binary detection rate achieved 91.4% accuracy, which shows the advantages of using the proposed deep learning approach. Finally, the real-world application are analyzed and discussed.<sep>Automated driving (AD) has been widely recognised as the future of transportation, especially the level-4 AD defined by SAE J3016 with its promising mass-production potential, drawing great attention across industry and the academia. However, high-level AD has been long criticised for its high development cost, high technical uncertainties, and the lack of industrial-accepted processes to assure safety and product quality. This paper presents the work of developing a systems engineering framework and an open platform for facilitating the development of AD features from an industrial perspective. The systems engineering framework is an extension and adjustment of the traditional V-model process to fit for the AD development purposes. Starting from a business need, the development work is arranged in a top-down manner, with techniques of requirements engineering, testing planning, and safety considerations. In order to accommodate the uncertain nature of AD development, agile methods are added and integrated with the proposed framework. With this framework, an open platform was developed and some of the key parts of this platform including hardware, software, communication network, and verification and validation work are presented. An AD feature based on this platform providing the basic AD function was demonstrated. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and the open platform concept for facilitating AD development in an industrial environment. The work laid groundworks for clearing the way for the industrialisation of AD technologies with the future evolution of the proposed methodology and the platform.<sep>With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles, drivers are increasingly likely to share their control authorities with the intelligent control unit. For building an efficient Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and shared-control systems, the vehicle needs to understand the drivers’ intent and their activities to generate assistant and collaborative control strategies. In this study, a driver intention inference system that focuses on the highway lane change maneuvers is proposed. First, a high-level driver intention mechanism and framework are introduced. Then, a vision-based intention inference system is proposed, which captures the multi-modal signals based on multiple low-cost cameras and the VBOX vehicle data acquisition system. A novel ensemble bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units is proposed to deal with the time-series driving sequence and the temporal behavioral patterns. Naturalistic highway driving data that consists of lane-keeping, left and right lane change maneuvers are collected and used for model construction and evaluation. Furthermore, the driver's pre-maneuver activities are statistically analyzed. It is found that for situation-aware, drivers usually check the mirrors for more than six seconds before they initiate the lane change maneuver, and the time interval between steering the handwheel and crossing the lane is about 2 s on average. Finally, hypothesis testing is conducted to show the significant improvement of the proposed algorithm over existing ones. With five-fold cross-validation, the EBiLSTM model achieves an average accuracy of 96.1% for the intention that is inferred 0.5 s before the maneuver starts.<sep>With the prosperous growing of intelligent technology, the automobile industry is developing towards an unmanned and intelligent generation. However, making a car drive in a human-like way is still a great challenge to engineers, which slows the adoption of such cars in a mass scale. Considering human perception capabilities during the design process might be a solution to this problem, and hazard perception is of great important. The aim of the study is to propose a theoretical framework for exploring the relationship between driving environment and human perceived hazards to give suggestions on designing human-like vehicle controllers. Correlating objective environmental factors with subjective hazard ratings. Human-in-the-loop experiments were carried out on a high-fidelity driving simulator. 27 driving scenarios were designed and implemented for 14 participants to acquire their subjective hazard ratings, while objective measurements were also recorded. Specifically, by using the proposed methodology hazard perception level of passenger can be measured by using the subjective parameters adopted during the experiment, which stands for the subjective assessment of passenger’s hazard perception. To find what dynamic parameters having a significant correlation with hazard perception level, a seven scale of subjective hazard perception was defined from –3 to 3, namely over dangerous, dangerous, a little dangerous, normal, a little cautious, cautious, overcautious. Objective measures of environment include the velocity and acceleration of the subjective car and the distance between the subjective car and obstacle. A 3*3*3 mixed ANOVA was carried out in our study in order to find out the correlation between the environment and subjective assessment. The finding shows us that the interaction of velocity and acceleration and distance has a strong correlation with the passenger’s hazard perception. The others show no correlation be-tween hazard perception assessment. This research is with great potential to improve the development of Advanced Driver Assistant System (ADAS) and intelligent automobile from a human perspective. The findings can also be applied to the design of vehicle controllers to improve the passenger’s comfort by knowing that on what condition or what kind of control the passenger will feel dangerous and uncomfortable.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Foundation (evidence)<sep>Sustainable energy<sep>Serviceability (structure)<sep>Renewable energy<sep>Turbine<sep>Wind power<sep>Offshore wind power</keyword><title>Wind power: A sustainable way to limit climate change<sep>Physical Modelling of Offshore Wind Turbine Foundations for TRL (Technology Readiness Level) Studies</title><abstract>This chapter reviews the potential of wind as a sustainable power source. In particular, large-scale offshore wind farms have emerged as critical renewable energy technology to reduce GHG emission and autonomy in energy production. Each of these wind farms consists of many wind turbine generators, each mounted on a support structure and is capable of generating up to 1.2 GW of power. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of wind energy and to appreciate the multidisciplinary nature of the engineering issues involved. Recent advances are discussed and the challenges in design and construction are also highlighted.<sep>Offshore wind turbines are a complex, dynamically sensitive structure due to their irregular mass and stiffness distribution, and complexity of the loading conditions they need to withstand. There are other challenges in particular locations such as typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes, sea-bed currents, and tsunami. Because offshore wind turbines have stringent Serviceability Limit State (SLS) requirements and need to be installed in variable and often complex ground conditions, their foundation design is challenging. Foundation design must be robust due to the enormous cost of retrofitting in a challenging environment should any problem occur during the design lifetime. Traditionally, engineers use conventional types of foundation systems, such as shallow gravity-based foundations (GBF), suction caissons, or slender piles or monopiles, based on prior experience with designing such foundations for the oil and gas industry. For offshore wind turbines, however, new types of foundations are being considered for which neither prior experience nor guidelines exist. One of the major challenges is to develop a method to de-risk the life cycle of offshore wind turbines in diverse metocean and geological conditions. The paper, therefore, has the following aims: (a) provide an overview of the complexities and the common SLS performance requirements for offshore wind turbine; (b) discuss the use of physical modelling for verification and validation of innovative design concepts, taking into account all possible angles to de-risk the project; and (c) provide examples of applications in scaled model tests.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/152553/lecturer-or-senior-lecturer-in-digital-energy-systems/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5060073990", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5003813298", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in digital technologies, AI, and data analytics, which aligns well with the job description's focus on Digital Energy Systems.

However, successes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are hampered by reported systemic and organ-specific toxicities and by two-thirds of the patients being non-responders or subsequently acquiring resistance to approved ICIs. Hence substantial efforts are invested in discovering novel targeted immunotherapies aimed at reduced side-effects and improved potency. One way is utilizing the dual targeting feature of bispecific antibodies, which have made them increasingly popular for cancer immunotherapy. Easy and predictive screening methods for activation ranking of candidate drugs in tumor contra non-tumor environments are however lacking. Herein, we present a cell-based assay mimicking the tumor microenvironment by co-culturing B cells with engineered human embryonic kidney 293 T cells (HEK293T), presenting a controllable density of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ). A target density panel with three different surface protein levels on HEK293T cells was established by genetic constructs carrying regulatory elements limiting RNA translation of PDGFRβ. We employed a bispecific antibody-affibody construct called an AffiMab capable of binding PDGFRβ on cancer cells and CD40 expressed by B cells as a model. Specific activation of CD40-mediated signaling of immune cells was demonstrated with the two highest receptor-expressing cell lines, Level 2/3 and Level 4, while low-to-none in the low-expressing cell lines. The concept of receptor tuning and the presented co-culture protocol may be of general utility for assessing and developing novel bi-specific antibodies for immuno-oncology applications.<sep>Abstract The microenvironment and architecture of peritumoral tissue have been suggested to affect permissiveness for infiltration of malignant cells. Astrocytes constitute a heterogeneous population of cells and have been linked to proliferation, migration, and drug sensitivity of glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Through double‐immunohistochemical staining for platelet‐derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), this study explored the intercase variability among 45 human GBM samples regarding density of GFAP+ peritumoral astrocytes and a subset of GFAP+ peritumoral astrocyte‐like cells also expressing PDGFRα. Large intercase variability regarding the total peritumoral astrocyte density and the density of PDGFRα+/GFAP+ peritumoral astrocyte‐like cells was detected. DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses for commonly altered genetic tumor markers supported the interpretation that these cells represented a genetically unaffected host cell subset referred to as PDGFRα+/GFAP+ peritumoral astrocytes. The presence of PDGFRα+/GFAP+ peritumoral astrocytes was significantly positively correlated to older patient age and peritumoral astrocyte density, but not to other established prognostic factors. Notably, presence of PDGFRα+/GFAP+ peritumoral astrocytes, but not peritumoral astrocyte density, was associated with significantly shorter patient overall survival. The prognostic association of PDGFRα+/GFAP+ peritumoral astrocytes was confirmed in multivariable analyses. This exploratory study thus demonstrates previously unrecognized intercase variability and prognostic significance of peritumoral abundance of a novel PDGFRα+ subset of GFAP+ astrocytes. Findings suggest clinically relevant roles of the microenvironment of peritumoral GBM tissue and encourage further characterization of the novel astrocyte subset with regard to origin, function, and potential as biomarker and drug target.<sep>CD40 agonism by systemic administration of CD40 monoclonal antibodies has been explored in clinical trials for immunotherapy of cancer, uncovering enormous potential, but also dosing challenges in terms of systemic toxicity. CD40-dependent activation of antigen presenting cells is dependent on crosslinking of the CD40 receptor. Here we exploited this requisite by coupling crosslinking to cancer-receptor density by dual-targeting of CD40 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), which is highly expressed in the stroma of various types of tumors. A novel PDGFRBxCD40 Fc-silenced bispecific AffiMab was developed to this end to test whether it is possible to activate CD40 in a PDGFRB-targeted manner. A PDGFRB-binding Affibody molecule was fused to each heavy chain of an Fc-silenced CD40 agonistic monoclonal antibody to obtain a bispecific \"AffiMab\". Binding of the AffiMab to both PDGFRB and CD40 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance, bio-layer interferometry and flow cytometry, through analysis of cells expressing respective target. In a reporter assay, the AffiMab displayed increased CD40 potency in the presence of PDGFRB-conjugated beads, in a manner dependent on PDGFRB amount/bead. To test the concept in immunologically relevant systems with physiological levels of CD40 expression, the AffiMab was tested in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and B cells. Expression of activation markers was increased in moDCs specifically in the presence of PDGFRB-conjugated beads upon AffiMab treatment, while the Fc-silenced CD40 mAb did not stimulate CD40 activation. As expected, the AffiMab did not activate moDCs in the presence of unconjugated beads. Finally, in a co-culture experiment, the AffiMab activated moDCs and B cells in the presence of PDGFRB-expressing cells, but not in co-cultures with PDGFRB-negative cells. Collectively, these results suggest the possibility to activate CD40 in a PDGFRB-targeted manner in vitro. This encourages further investigation and the development of such an approach for the treatment of solid cancers.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Larva<sep>Parametric statistics<sep>Pharmacodynamics<sep>Workflow<sep>Metabolite<sep>Phases of clinical research<sep>Projection (relational algebra)<sep>Vaccination<sep>Meta-analysis<sep>IVIVC<sep>Iterative reconstruction<sep>Meropenem<sep>Matching (statistics)<sep>Drug discovery<sep>Drug<sep>Volume of distribution<sep>Hazard<sep>Initialization<sep>Clinical trial<sep>Selection (genetic algorithm)<sep>Isoniazid<sep>Pandemic<sep>Epidemiology<sep>Phase (matter)<sep>Dosing<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Adverse effect<sep>Variance (accounting)<sep>Respiratory tract infections<sep>Clinical endpoint<sep>Standardization<sep>Nonparametric statistics<sep>Covariate<sep>Event (particle physics)<sep>Population<sep>Health care<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Interim analysis<sep>Sputum<sep>Blood sampling<sep>Coefficient of variation<sep>Drug development<sep>Hatching<sep>Optical tomography<sep>Mycobacterium marinum<sep>Segmentation<sep>Randomized controlled trial<sep>Pharmacokinetics<sep>Sample size determination<sep>Hazard ratio<sep>Protocol (science)<sep>Incidence (geometry)<sep>Placebo<sep>Tuberculosis<sep>Alternative medicine<sep>Gene<sep>Zebrafish<sep>Model organism<sep>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</keyword><title>Translational pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics in zebrafish: integration of experimental and computational methods<sep>Implementing best practices on data generation and reporting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro assays within the ERA4TB consortium<sep>Pharmacokinetic analysis across studies to drive knowledge‐integration: A tutorial on individual patient data meta‐analysis (IPDMA)<sep>Impact of post-hatching maturation on the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol in zebrafish larvae<sep>Model-Informed Drug Discovery and Development Strategy for the Rapid Development of Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Combinations<sep>Implementing Best Practises on Data Generation and Reporting of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; Time Kill Assays: A Case Study of Standardized Protocol Within the ERA4TB Consortium<sep>Segmentation-Driven Optimization For Iterative Reconstruction in Optical Projection Tomography: An Exploration<sep>Translational predictions of phase 2a first-in-patient efficacy studies for antituberculosis drugs<sep>Reproducibility in pharmacometrics applied in a phase III trial of BCG-vaccination for COVID-19<sep>Finding the right hazard function for time‐to‐event modeling: A tutorial and Shiny application<sep>Anti‐tuberculosis effect of isoniazid scales accurately from zebrafish to humans<sep>Model‐informed pediatric dose selection of marzeptacog alfa (activated): an exposure matching strategy<sep>Seasonal influence on respiratory tract infection severity including COVID‐19 quantified through Markov Chain modeling<sep>Early Bactericidal Activity of Meropenem plus Clavulanate (with or without Rifampin) for Tuberculosis: The COMRADE Randomized, Phase 2A Clinical Trial<sep>Quantification of Natural Growth of Two Strains of <i>Mycobacterium Marinum</i> for Translational Antituberculosis Drug Development<sep>Safety and efficacy of BCG re-vaccination in relation to COVID-19 morbidity in healthcare workers: A double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial<sep>Mechanistic and Quantitative Understanding of Pharmacokinetics in Zebrafish Larvae through Nanoscale Blood Sampling and Metabolite Modeling of Paracetamol<sep>Safety and Efficacy of BCG Re-Vaccination in Reducing COVID-19 Morbidity in Healthcare Workers: A Double-Blind, Randomised, Controlled, Phase 3 Trial<sep>Standards for model-based early bactericidal activity analysis and sample size determination in tuberculosis drug development</title><abstract>The zebrafish is a promising vertebrate model organism in early drug discovery and development. Translation of pharmacological findings to higher vertebrates requires quantification of the underlying pharmacological and (patho)physiological processes. In this thesis, we therefore developed and integrated innovative experimental and computational methods for the successful quantification of 1) the internal exposure over time after waterborne drug treatment, 2) disease dynamics and drug-induced changes therein, and 3) between-species differences in disease mechanisms. The state-of-the-art methods that we developed included nanoscale blood sampling, sensitive LC-MS/MS methods for drugs and their isomers and metabolites, and three-dimensional microscopy, integrated with non-linear mixed effects modelling to quantify the pharmacological processes in this small vertebrate. This multidisciplinarity enabled quantification of internal drug exposure-response relationships, contributed to positioning the zebrafish in the preclinical drug development pipeline, and inspired continuous collaborations between experimental and computational scientists.<sep>Tuberculosis (TB) is the historical leading cause of death by a single infectious agent. The European Regimen Accelerator for Tuberculosis (ERA4TB) is a public-private partnership of 30+ institutions with the objective to progress new anti-TB regimens into the clinic. Thus, robust and replicable results across independent laboratories are essential for reliable interpretation of treatment efficacy. A standardization workgroup unified in vitro protocols and data reporting templates. Time-kill assays provide essential input data for pharmacometric model-informed translation of single agents and regimens activity from in vitro to in vivo and the clinic. Five conditions were assessed by time-kill assays in six independent laboratories using four bacterial plating methods. Baseline bacterial burden varied between laboratories but variability was limited in net drug effect, confirming 2.5 μL equally robust as 100 μL plating. This exercise establishes the foundations of collaborative data generation, reporting, and integration within the overarching Antimicrobial Resistance Accelerator program.<sep>Abstract Answering challenging questions in drug development sometimes requires pharmacokinetic (PK) data analysis across different studies, for example, to characterize PKs across diverse regions or populations, or to increase statistical power for subpopulations by combining smaller size trials. Given the growing interest in data sharing and advanced computational methods, knowledge integration based on multiple data sources is increasingly applied in the context of model‐informed drug discovery and development. A powerful analysis method is the individual patient data meta‐analysis (IPDMA), leveraging systematic review of databases and literature, with the most detailed data type of the individual patient, and quantitative modeling of the PK processes, including capturing heterogeneity of variance between studies. The methodology that should be used in IPDMA in the context of population PK analysis is summarized in this tutorial, highlighting areas of special attention compared to standard PK modeling, including hierarchical nested variability terms for interstudy variability, and handling between‐assay differences in limits of quantification within a single analysis. This tutorial is intended for any pharmacological modeler who is interested in performing an integrated analysis of PK data across different studies in a systematic and thorough manner, to answer questions that transcend individual primary studies.<sep>Zebrafish larvae are increasingly used in pharmacological and toxicological studies, but it is often overlooked that internal exposure to exogenous compounds, rather than the incubation medium concentration, is driving observed effects. Moreover, as the zebrafish larva is a developing organism, continuous physiological changes impact pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic processes like the absorption and elimination of exogenous compounds, influencing the interpretation of observations and conclusions drawn from experiments at different larval ages. Here, using paracetamol as paradigm compound, mathematical modelling is used to quantify absorption and elimination rates from internal exposure over time profiles after waterborne treatment, as well as changes in these parameters in post-hatching larvae of 3, 4, and 5 days post fertilisation (dpf). An increase of 106% in absorption rate was observed between 3 and 4 dpf, but no further increase at 5 dpf, and an increase of 17.5% in elimination rate for each dpf. Paracetamol clearance, determined from elimination rate constants and reported total larval volumes of 253, 263, and 300 nL at 3, 4, and 5 dpf respectively, correlates best with higher vertebrates at 5 dpf. This suggests that when studying direct effects of exogenous compounds, experiments with zebrafish larvae are best performed at 5 dpf.<sep>The increasing emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis requires new effective and safe drug regimens. However, drug discovery and development are challenging, lengthy and costly. The framework of model-informed drug discovery and development (MID3) is proposed to be applied throughout the preclinical to clinical phases to provide an informative prediction of drug exposure and efficacy in humans in order to select novel anti-tuberculosis drug combinations. The MID3 includes pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and quantitative systems pharmacology models, machine learning and artificial intelligence, which integrates all the available knowledge related to disease and the compounds. A translational in vitro-in vivo link throughout modeling and simulation is crucial to optimize the selection of regimens with the highest probability of receiving approval from regulatory authorities. In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling provide powerful tools to predict pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions based on preclinical information. Mechanistic or semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models have been successfully applied to predict the clinical exposure-response profile for anti-tuberculosis drugs using preclinical data. Potential pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions can be predicted from in vitro data through IVIVC and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling accounting for translational factors. It is essential for academic and industrial drug developers to collaborate across disciplines to realize the huge potential of MID3.<sep>Tuberculosis (TB) is the deadliest infectious disease after COVID-19.

In this paper we employ iterative reconstruction algorithms to avoid streak artefacts in the reconstruction and explore possible ways to optimize two parameters of the algorithms, i.e., iteration number and initialization, in order to improve the reconstruction performance. As benchmarks for direct reconstruction evaluation in optical projection tomography are absent, we consider the assessment through the performance of the segmentation on the 3D reconstruction. In our explorative experiments we use the zebrafish model system which is a typical specimen for use in optical projection tomography system; and as such frequently used. In this manner data can be easily obtained from which a benchmark set can be built. For the segmentation approach we apply a two-dimensional U-net convolutional neural network because it is recognized to have a good performance in biomedical image segmentation. In order to prevent the training from getting stuck in local minima, a novel learning rate schema is proposed. This optimization achieves a lower training loss during the training process, as compared to an optimal constant learning rate. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach to the benchmarking of iterative reconstruction via results of segmentation is very<sep>Background: Phase 2a trials in tuberculosis typically use early bactericidal activity (EBA), the decline in sputum CFU over 14 days, as the primary end-point for testing the efficacy of drugs as monotherapy. However, the cost of phase 2a trials can range from USD 7 million to USD 19.6 million on average, while &gt;30% of drugs fail to progress to phase 3. Better utilising pre-clinical data to predict and prioritise the most likely drugs to succeed will thus help to accelerate drug development and reduce costs. We aim to predict clinical EBA using pre-clinical in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) data and a model-based translational pharmacology approach. Methods and findings: First, mouse PK, PD and clinical PK models were compiled. Second, mouse PK-PD models were built to derive an exposure–response relationship. Third, translational prediction of clinical EBA studies was performed using mouse PK-PD relationships and informed by clinical PK models and species-specific protein binding. Presence or absence of clinical efficacy was accurately predicted from the mouse model. Predicted daily decreases of CFU in the first 2 days of treatment and between day 2 and day 14 were consistent with clinical observations. Conclusion: This platform provides an innovative solution to inform or even replace<sep>Large clinical trials often generate complex and large datasets which need to be presented frequently throughout the trial for interim analysis or to inform a data safety monitory board (DSMB). In addition, reliable and traceability are required to ensure reproducibility in pharmacometric data analysis. A reproducible pharmacometric analysis workflow was developed during a large clinical trial involving 1000 participants over one year testing Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) (re)vaccination in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality in frontline health care workers. The workflow was designed to review data iteratively during the trial, compile frequent reports to the DSMB, and prepare for rapid pharmacometric analysis. Clinical trial datasets (n = 41) were transferred iteratively throughout the trial for review. An RMarkdown based pharmacometric processing script was written to automatically generate reports for evaluation by the DSMB. Reports were compiled, reviewed, and sent to the DSMB on average three days after the data cut-off, reflecting the trial progress in real-time. The script was also utilized to prepare for the trial pharmacometric analyses. The same source data was used to create analysis datasets in NONMEM format and to support model script development. The primary endpoint analysis was completed three days after data lock and unblinding,<sep>Parametric time-to-event analysis is an important pharmacometric method to predict the probability of an event up until a certain time as a function of covariates and/or drug exposure. Modeling is performed at the level of the hazard function describing the instantaneous rate of an event occurring at that timepoint. We give an overview of the parametric time-to-event analysis starting with graphical exploration by Kaplan-Meier plotting for the event data including censoring and nonparametric hazard estimators such as the kernel-based visual hazard comparison for the underlying hazard. The most common hazard functions including the exponential, Gompertz, Weibull, log-normal, log-logistic, and circadian functions are described in detail. A Shiny application was developed to graphically guide the modeler which of the most common hazard functions presents a similar shape compared to the data in order to guide which hazard functions to test in the parametric time-to-event analysis. For the chosen hazard function(s), the Shiny application can additionally be used to explore corresponding parameter values to inform on suitable initial estimates for parametric modeling as well as on possible covariate or treatment relationships to certain parameters. Moreover, it can be used for the dissemination of results as well as communication, training, and workshops on time-to-event<sep>Background and Purpose There is a clear need for innovation in anti‐tuberculosis drug development. The zebrafish larva is an attractive disease model in tuberculosis research. To translate pharmacological findings to higher vertebrates, including humans, the internal exposure of drugs needs to be quantified and linked to observed response. Experimental Approach In zebrafish studies, drugs are usually dissolved in the external water, posing a challenge to quantify internal exposure. We developed experimental methods to quantify internal exposure, including nanoscale blood sampling, and to quantify the bacterial burden, using automated fluorescence imaging analysis, with isoniazid as the test compound. We used pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling to quantify the exposure–response relationship responsible for the antibiotic response. To translate isoniazid response to humans, quantitative exposure–response relationships in zebrafish were linked to simulated concentration–time profiles in humans, and two quantitative translational factors on sensitivity to isoniazid and stage of infection were included. Key Results Blood concentration was only 20% of the external drug concentration. The bacterial burden increased exponentially, and an isoniazid dose corresponding to 15 mg·L −1 internal concentration (minimum inhibitory concentration) leads to bacteriostasis of the mycobacterial infection in the zebrafish. The concentration–effect relationship was quantified, and based on that relationship and the translational factors, the<sep>Marzeptacog alfa (activated) (MarzAA) is an activated recombinant human rFVII variant intended for subcutaneous (s.c.) administration to treat or prevent bleeding in individuals with hemophilia A (HA) or B (HB) with inhibitors, and other rare bleeding disorders. The s.c. administration provides benefits over i.v. injections. The objective of the study was to support the first-in-pediatric dose selection for s.c. MarzAA to treat episodic bleeding episodes in children up through 11 years in a registrational phase III trial. Assuming the same exposure-response relationship as in adults, an exposure matching strategy was used with a population pharmacokinetics model. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the impact of doubling in absorption rate and age-dependent allometric exponents on dose selection was performed. Subsequently, the probability of trial success, defined as the number of successful trials for a given pediatric dose divided by the number of simulated trials (n = 1000) was studied. A successful trial was defined as outcome where four, three, or two out of 24 pediatric subjects per trial were allowed to fall outside the adult exposures after s.c. administration of 60 μg/kg. A dose of 60 μg/kg in children with HA/HB was supported by the clinical trial simulations to match exposures in adults. The<sep>Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a burden to global health, but their characterization is complicated by the influence of seasonality on incidence and severity. The Re-BCG-CoV-19 trial (NCT04379336) assessed BCG (re)vaccination for protection from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and recorded 958 RTIs in 574 individuals followed over 1 year. We characterized the probability of RTI occurrence and severity using a Markov model with health scores (HSs) for four states of symptom severity. Covariate analysis on the transition probability between HSs explored the influence of demographics, medical history, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or influenza vaccinations, which became available during the trial, SARS-CoV-2 serology, and epidemiology-informed seasonal influence of infection pressure represented as regional COVID-19 pandemic waves, as well as BCG (re)vaccination. The infection pressure reflecting the pandemic waves increased the risk of RTI symptom development, whereas the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies protected against RTI symptom development and increased the probability of symptom relief. Higher probability of symptom relief was also found in participants with African ethnicity and with male biological gender. SARS-CoV-2 or influenza vaccination reduced the probability of transitioning from mild to healthy symptoms. Model diagnostics over calendar-time indicated that COVID-19 cases were under-reported during the first wave by<sep>Rationale: Carbapenems are recommended for treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Optimal dosing remains uncertain. Objectives: To evaluate the 14-day bactericidal activity of meropenem, at different doses, with or without rifampin. Methods: Individuals with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis were randomized to one of four intravenous meropenem-based arms: 2 g every 8 hours (TID) (arm C), 2 g TID plus rifampin at 20 mg/kg once daily (arm D), 1 g TID (arm E), or 3 g once daily (arm F). All participants received amoxicillin/clavulanate with each meropenem dose. Serial overnight sputum samples were collected from baseline and throughout treatment. Median daily fall in colony-forming unit (CFU) counts per milliliter of sputum (solid culture) (EBACFU0-14) and increase in time to positive culture (TTP) in liquid media were estimated with mixed-effects modeling. Serial blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis on Day 13. Measurements and Main Results: Sixty participants enrolled. Median EBACFU0-14 counts (2.5th-97.5th percentiles) were 0.22 (0.12-0.33), 0.12 (0.057-0.21), 0.059 (0.033-0.097), and 0.053 (0.035-0.081); TTP increased by 0.34 (0.21-0.75), 0.11 (0.052-0.37), 0.094 (0.034-0.23), and 0.12 (0.04-0.41) (log10 h), for arms C-F, respectively. Meropenem pharmacokinetics were not affected by rifampin coadministration. Twelve participants withdrew early, many of whom cited gastrointestinal adverse events. Conclusions: Bactericidal activity was greater<sep>The zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium marinum ( M. marinum ) is an attractive tuberculosis disease model, showing similar pathogenesis to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) infections in humans. To translate pharmacological findings from this disease model to higher vertebrates, a quantitative understanding of the natural growth of M. marinum in comparison to the natural growth of M. tuberculosis is essential. Here, the natural growth of two strains of M. marinum , E11 and M USA , is studied over an extended period using an established model‐based approach, the multistate tuberculosis pharmacometric (MTP) model, for comparison to that of M. tuberculosis . Poikilotherm‐derived strain E11 and human‐derived strain M USA were grown undisturbed up to 221 days and viability of cultures (colony forming unit (CFU)/mL) was determined by plating at different time points. Nonlinear mixed effects modeling using the MTP model quantified the bacterial growth, the transfer among fast, slow, and non‐multiplying states, and the inoculi. Both strains showed initial logistic growth, reaching a maximum after 20–25 days for E11 and M USA , respectively, followed by a decrease to a new plateau. Natural growth of both E11 and M USA was best described with Gompertz growth functions. For E11, the<sep>BCG vaccination prevents severe childhood tuberculosis (TB) and was introduced in South Africa in the 1950s. It is hypothesised that BCG trains the innate immune system by inducing epigenetic and functional reprogramming, thus providing non-specific protection from respiratory tract infections. We evaluated BCG for reduction of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 in healthcare workers in South Africa.This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited healthcare workers at three facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa, unless unwell, pregnant, breastfeeding, immunocompromised, hypersensitivity to BCG, or undergoing experimental COVID-19 treatment. Participants received BCG or saline intradermally (1:1) and were contacted once every 4 weeks for 1 year. COVID-19 testing was guided by symptoms. Hospitalisation, COVID-19, and respiratory tract infections were assessed with Cox proportional hazard modelling and time-to-event analyses, and event severity with post hoc Markovian analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04379336.Between May 4 and Oct 23, 2020, we enrolled 1000 healthcare workers with a median age of 39 years (IQR 30-49), 70·4% were female, 16·5% nurses, 14·4% medical doctors, 48·5% had latent TB, and 15·3% had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Hospitalisation due to COVID-19 occurred in 15 participants (1·5%); ten (66·7%) in the BCG group and five (33·3%) in the<sep>Zebrafish larvae are increasingly used for pharmacological research, but internal drug exposure is often not measured. Understanding pharmacokinetics is necessary for reliable translation of pharmacological results to higher vertebrates, including humans. Quantification of drug clearance and distribution requires measurements of blood concentrations. Additionally, measuring drug metabolites is of importance to understand clearance in this model organism mechanistically. We therefore mechanistically studied and quantified pharmacokinetics in zebrafish larvae, and compared this to higher vertebrates, using paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a paradigm compound. A method was developed to sample blood from zebrafish larvae 5 days post fertilization. Blood concentrations of paracetamol and its major metabolites, paracetamol-glucuronide and paracetamol-sulfate, were measured. Blood concentration data were combined with measured amounts in larval homogenates and excreted amounts and simultaneously analyzed through nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, quantifying absolute clearance and distribution volume. Blood sampling from zebrafish larvae was most successful from the posterior cardinal vein, with a median volume (interquartile range) of 1.12 nl (0.676–1.66 nl) per blood sample. Samples were pooled (<i>n</i> = 15–35) to reach measurable levels. Paracetamol blood concentrations at steady state were only 10% of the external paracetamol concentration. Paracetamol-sulfate was the major metabolite, and its formation was quantified using a time-dependent metabolic formation rate.<sep>Background: Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination prevents severe childhood tuberculosis and was in use in South Africa from the 1950’s.

The aim of this work was to present a standardized pharmacometric model-based early bactericidal activity analysis workflow and determine sample sizes needed to detect early bactericidal activity or a difference between treatment arms. Methods: Seven different steps were identified and developed for a standardized pharmacometric model-based early bactericidal activity analysis approach. Non-linear mixed effects modeling was applied and different scenarios were explored for the sample size calculations. The sample sizes needed to detect early bactericidal activity given different TTP slopes and associated variability was assessed. In addition, the sample sizes needed to detect effect differences between two treatments given the impact of different TTP slopes, variability in TTP slope and effect differences were evaluated. Results: The presented early bactericidal activity analysis approach incorporates estimate of early bactericidal activity with uncertainty through the model-based estimate of TTP slope, variability in TTP slope, impact of covariates and pharmacokinetics on drug efficacy. Further it allows for treatment comparison or dose optimization in Phase 2a.

To better understand cellular interactions driving the mechanisms in endometrial regeneration we employed single-cell RNA sequencing. Endometrial samples were obtained during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle from healthy women aged 24–32 years. Within the stromal compartment multiple stromal populations were found, suggestive of specific stromal niches that control inflammation and extracellular matrix composition. Ten different stromal cell and two pericyte subsets were identified. Applying different R packages (Seurat, SingleR, Velocyto) we determined cell cluster diversity and cell lineage/trajectory while using external data to validate our findings. By understanding healthy regeneration in the described stromal compartments, we aim to identify points of intervention for novel therapy development in order to treat benign gynaecological disorders affecting endometrial regeneration and proliferation e.g. endometriosis and Asherman’s syndrome.<sep>The endometrium undergoes regular regeneration and stromal proliferation as part of the normal menstrual cycle. To better understand cellular interactions driving the mechanisms in endometrial regeneration we employed single-cell RNA sequencing. Endometrial biopsies were obtained during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle from healthy fertile women and processed to single-cell suspensions which were submitted for sequencing. In addition to known endometrial cell types, bioinformatic analysis revealed multiple stromal populations suggestive of specific stromal niches with the ability to control inflammation and extracellular matrix composition. Ten different stromal cells and two pericyte subsets were identified. Applying different R packages (Seurat, SingleR, Velocyto) we established cell cluster diversity and cell lineage/trajectory, while using external data to validate our findings. By understanding healthy regeneration in the described stromal compartments, we aim to identify points of further investigation and possible targets for novel therapy development for benign gynecological disorders affecting endometrial regeneration and proliferation such as endometriosis and Asherman’s syndrome.<sep>Abstract Background In Asherman’s syndrome (AS), intrauterine scarring and fibrotic adhesions lead to menstrual disorders, pregnancy loss, or infertility. A few clinical trials have piloted cell therapy to overcome AS. Understanding the role of the stromal compartment in endometrial regeneration remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that endometrial stromal cells (eSCs) represent a relevant cell population to establish novel cell-based therapeutics for endometrial disorders. The aim of this study was to characterize eSCs and evaluate their immune-cell interactions. Methods eSCs were isolated from healthy donors, during the proliferative stage of the menstrual cycle. Cells were characterized for expression of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) markers and assessed for their tumorigenic potential. eSCs were co-cultured with interferon γ and tumor necrosis factor α, and cell surface expression of their respective receptors and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I and II determined by flow cytometry. Secreted levels of key immunomodulatory factors were established. eSCs were cultured with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and T cell differentiation and proliferation determined. Results eSCs demonstrated an MSC surface phenotype and exhibited multipotency. Expanded eSCs retained chromosomal stability and demonstrated no tumorigenicity. Upon stimulation, eSCs licensed to an anti-inflammatory phenotype with upregulated secretion of immunomodulatory factors. Stimulated eSCs did not express HLA class II. eSCs suppressed the proliferation and activation of CD4+ T cells, with the eSC secretome further downregulating central memory T cells and upregulating effector memory (EM) cells. Conclusions Differential responsiveness to inflammation by eSCs, compared to other MSC sources, demonstrates the need to understand the specific functional effects of individual stromal cell sources. A lack of HLA class II and triggering of EM T cell differentiation strongly links to innate in vivo roles of eSCs in tissue repair and immune tolerance during pregnancy. We conclude that eSCs may be an ideal cell therapy candidate for endometrial disorders.<sep>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are used to treat immune-related disorders, including graft-versus-host disease. Upon intravenous infusion, MSCs trigger the instant blood-mediated inflammatory response, resulting in activation of both complement and coagulation cascades, and are rapidly cleared from circulation. Despite no/minimal engraftment, long-term immunoregulatory properties are evident. The aim of this study was to establish the effects of blood exposure on MSC viability and immunomodulatory functions.Human, bone marrow derived MSCs were exposed to human plasma +/- heat inactivation or whole blood. MSC number, viability and cellular damage was assessed using the JC-1 mitochondrial depolarization assay and annexin V staining. C3c binding and expression of the inhibitory receptors CD46, CD55 and CD59 and complement receptors C3aR and C5aR were evaluated by flow cytometry. MSCs pre-exposed to plasma were cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocyte subsets characterized by flow cytometry. The PBMC and MSC secretome was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays against tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10. Monocyte recruitment towards the MSC secretome was evaluated using Boyden chambers and screened for chemotactic factors including monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. MSC effects on the peripheral immune repertoire was also evaluated in whole blood by flow cytometry.Plasma induced rapid lysis of 57% of MSCs, which reduced to 1% lysis with heat inactivation plasma. Of those cells that were not lysed, C3c could be seen bound to the surface of the cells, with a significant swelling of the MSCs and induction of cell death. The MSC secretome reduced monocyte recruitment, in part due to a reduction in MCP-1, and downregulated PBMC tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion while increasing IL-6 levels in the co-culture supernatant. A significant decrease in CD14+ monocytes was evident after MSC addition to whole blood alongside a significant increase in IL-6 levels, with those remaining monocytes demonstrating an increase in classical and decrease in non-classical subsets. This was accompanied by a significant increase in both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells.This study demonstrates that a significant number of MSCs are rapidly lysed upon contact with blood, with those surviving demonstrating a shift in their phenotype, including a reduction in the secretion of monocyte recruitment factors and an enhanced ability to skew the phenotype of monocytes. Shifts in the innate immune repertoire, towards an immunosuppressive profile, were also evident within whole blood after MSC addition. These findings suggest that exposure to blood components can promote peripheral immunomodulation via multiple mechanisms that persists within the system long after the infused MSCs have been cleared.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Thyroid hormone receptor<sep>Biomarker<sep>Skeletal muscle<sep>Food intake<sep>Diabetes mellitus<sep>Receptor<sep>Metformin<sep>Metabolism<sep>Regulator<sep>Carbohydrate metabolism<sep>Adipogenesis<sep>Offspring<sep>Euthyroid<sep>Hormone<sep>Knockout mouse<sep>Thermogenin<sep>Gestation<sep>Myokine<sep>Tachycardia<sep>Brown adipose tissue<sep>Glucose uptake<sep>Adipose tissue<sep>Pregnancy<sep>Downregulation and upregulation<sep>Heart rate<sep>Myograph<sep>Bradycardia<sep>Autocrine signalling<sep>Triiodothyronine<sep>GDF15<sep>White adipose tissue<sep>Thermogenesis<sep>Thyroid<sep>Nuclear receptor</keyword><title>The GDF15-GFRAL pathway is dispensable for the effects of metformin on energy balance<sep>Thyroid hormones regulate Zfp423 expression in regionally distinct adipose depots through direct and cell-autonomous action<sep>Maternal thyroid hormone receptor β activation in mice sparks brown fat thermogenesis in the offspring<sep>Thyroid-Hormone-Induced Browning of White Adipose Tissue Does Not Contribute to Thermogenesis and Glucose Consumption<sep>Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTHα syndrome<sep>The Role of GDF15 as a Myomitokine<sep>Pantothenate Kinase 4 controls efficient skeletal muscle energy substrate metabolism via acetyl-CoA<sep>Aortic effects of thyroid hormone in male mice<sep>Cross-species comparison of pregnancy-induced GDF15<sep>Dietary medium-chain fatty acids reduce food intake via the GDF15-GFRAL axis in mice<sep>Partial resistance to thyroid hormone-induced tachycardia and cardiac hypertrophy in mice lacking thyroid hormone receptor beta<sep>CD5L Constitutes a Novel Biomarker for Integrated Hepatic Thyroid Hormone Action</title><abstract>Metformin is a blood-glucose-lowering medication with physiological effects that extend beyond its anti-diabetic indication. Recently, it was reported that metformin lowers body weight via induction of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which suppresses food intake by binding to the GDNF family receptor α-like (GFRAL) in the hindbrain. Here, we corroborate that metformin increases circulating GDF15 in mice and humans, but we fail to confirm previous reports that the GDF15-GFRAL pathway is necessary for the weight-lowering effects of metformin. Instead, our studies in wild-type, GDF15 knockout, and GFRAL knockout mice suggest that the GDF15-GFRAL pathway is dispensable for the effects of metformin on energy balance. The data presented here question whether metformin is a sufficiently strong stimulator of GDF15 to drive anorexia and weight loss and emphasize that additional work is needed to untangle the relationship among metformin, GDF15, and energy balance.<sep>The hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis is a major regulator of many differentiation processes, including adipose tissue. However, it remains unclear whether and how thyroid hormone (TH) signaling contributes to preadipocyte commitment and differentiation into mature adipocytes. Here, we show a cell-autonomous effect of TH on the transcriptional regulation of zinc finger protein 423 (Zfp423), an early adipogenic determination factor, in murine adipose depots. Mechanistically, binding of the unliganded TH receptor to a negative TH responsive element within the Zfp423 promoter activates transcriptional activity that is reversed upon TH binding. Zfp423 upregulation is associated with increased GFP+ preadipocyte recruitment in stromal vascular fraction isolated from white fat of hypothyroid Zfp423GFP reporter mice. RNA sequencing identified Zfp423-driven gene programs that are modulated in response to TH during adipogenic differentiation. Collectively, we identified Zfp423 as a key molecule that integrates TH signaling into the regulation of adipose tissue plasticity.<sep>Abstract It is well established that maternal thyroid hormones play an important role for the developing fetus; however, the consequences of maternal hyperthyroidism for the offspring remain poorly understood. Here we show in mice that maternal 3,3’,5-triiodothyronine (T3) treatment during pregnancy leads to improved glucose tolerance in the adult male offspring and hyperactivity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis in both sexes starting early after birth. The activated BAT provides advantages upon cold exposure, reducing the strain on other thermogenic organs like muscle. This maternal BAT programming requires intact maternal thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ) signaling, as offspring of mothers lacking this receptor display the opposite phenotype. On the molecular level, we identify distinct T3 induced alterations in maternal serum metabolites, including choline, a key metabolite for healthy pregnancy. Taken together, our results connect maternal TRβ activation to the fetal programming of a thermoregulatory phenotype in the offspring.<sep>Regulation of body temperature critically depends on thyroid hormone (TH). Recent studies revealed that TH induces browning of white adipose tissue, possibly contributing to the observed hyperthermia in hyperthyroid patients and potentially providing metabolic benefits. Here, we show that browning by TH requires TH-receptor β and occurs independently of the sympathetic nervous system. The beige fat, however, lacks sufficient adrenergic stimulation and is not metabolically activated despite high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Studies at different environmental temperatures reveal that TH instead causes hyperthermia by actions in skeletal muscle combined with a central body temperature set-point elevation. Consequently, the metabolic and thermogenic effects of systemic hyperthyroidism were maintained in UCP1 knockout mice, demonstrating that neither beige nor brown fat contributes to the TH-induced hyperthermia and elevated glucose consumption, and underlining that the mere presence of UCP1 is insufficient to draw conclusions on the therapeutic potential of browning agents.<sep>Mutations in thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) cause Resistance to Thyroid Hormone α (RTHα), a disorder characterized by hypothyroidism in TRα1-expressing tissues including the heart. Surprisingly, we report that treatment of RTHα patients with thyroxine to overcome tissue hormone resistance does not elevate their heart rate. Cardiac telemetry in male, TRα1 mutant, mice indicates that such persistent bradycardia is caused by an intrinsic cardiac defect and not due to altered autonomic control. Transcriptomic analyses show preserved, thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent upregulation of pacemaker channels (Hcn2, Hcn4), but irreversibly reduced expression of several ion channel genes controlling heart rate. Exposure of TRα1 mutant male mice to higher maternal T3 concentrations in utero, restores altered expression and DNA methylation of ion channels, including Ryr2. Our findings indicate that target genes other than Hcn2 and Hcn4 mediate T3-induced tachycardia and suggest that treatment of RTHα patients with thyroxine in high dosage without concomitant tachycardia, is possible.<sep>Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a cytokine best known for affecting systemic energy metabolism through its anorectic action. GDF15 expression and secretion from various organs and tissues is induced in different physiological and pathophysiological states, often linked to mitochondrial stress, leading to highly variable circulating GDF15 levels. In skeletal muscle and the heart, the basal expression of GDF15 is very low compared to other organs, but GDF15 expression and secretion can be induced in various stress conditions, such as intense exercise and acute myocardial infarction, respectively. GDF15 is thus considered as a myokine and cardiokine. GFRAL, the exclusive receptor for GDF15, is expressed in hindbrain neurons and activation of the GDF15-GFRAL pathway is linked to an increased sympathetic outflow and possibly an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. There is also evidence for peripheral, direct effects of GDF15 on adipose tissue lipolysis and possible autocrine cardiac effects. Metabolic and behavioral outcomes of GDF15 signaling can be beneficial or detrimental, likely depending on the magnitude and duration of the GDF15 signal. This is especially apparent for GDF15 production in muscle, which can be induced both by exercise and by muscle disease states such as sarcopenia and mitochondrial myopathy.<sep>Abstract Metabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle (SkM) is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise improves metabolic flexibility, rendering it a valuable discovery tool of mechanisms promoting efficient metabolism of glucose and lipids. We herein discover pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) as a conserved exercise target with high abundance in SkM. We go on to show that murine muscle Pank4 is dysregulated with high-fat diet feeding, and identify human PANK4 variants that associate with glycemic control and body mass index traits, indicating important roles of PanK4 in glucose metabolism and growth. Consistent with the latter, germline deletion of PanK4 reduces circulating IGF-1 and stunts growth in mice. Deletion specifically in mouse SkM reveals that PanK4 facilitates fatty acid oxidation by acting as a regulator of SkM acetyl-CoA, a key node in metabolism of both glucose and lipids. Consequently, without PanK4, elevated SkM acetyl-CoA levels allosterically gridlock key enzymes required for efficient lipid and glucose utilization, and these SkM metabolic perturbations manifest in whole-body insulin resistance. As proof of principle, we show that an increase in muscle PanK4 lowers SkM acetyl-CoA and increases SkM glucose utilization. Our findings identify PanK4 as a novel regulator of SkM energy substrate metabolism, warranting inclusion in comprehensive strategies against metabolic disease.<sep>It is well established that thyroid hormones are required for cardiovascular functions; however, the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, especially the individual contributions of genomic and non-genomic signalling pathways. In this study, we dissected how thyroid hormones modulate aortic contractility. To test the immediate effects of thyroid hormones on vasocontractility, we used a wire myograph to record the contractile response of dissected mouse aortas to the adrenergic agonist phenylephrine in the presence of different doses of T3 (3,3',5-triiodothyronine). Interestingly, we observed reduced vasoconstriction under low and high T3 concentrations, indicating an inversed U-shaped curve with maximal constrictive capacity at euthyroid conditions. We then tested for possible genomic actions of thyroid hormones on vasocontractility by treating mice for 4 days with 1 mg/L thyroxine in drinking water. The study revealed that in contrast to the non-genomic actions the aortas of these animals were hyperresponsive to the contractile stimulus, an effect not observed in endogenously hyperthyroid TRβ knockout mice. To identify targets of genomic thyroid hormone action, we analysed aortic gene expression by microarray, revealing several altered genes including the well-known thyroid hormone target gene hairless. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that thyroid hormones regulate aortic tone through genomic and non-genomic actions, although genomic actions seem to prevail in vivo. Moreover, we identified several novel thyroid hormone target genes that could provide a better understanding of the molecular changes occurring in the hyperthyroid aorta.<sep>Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a stress-induced cytokine. Although the exact physiological function of GDF15 is not yet fully comprehended, the significant elevation of circulating GDF15 levels during gestation suggests a potential role for this hormone in pregnancy. This is corroborated by genetic association studies in which GDF15 and the GDF15 receptor, GDNF family receptor alpha like (GFRAL) have been linked to morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) in humans. Here, we studied GDF15 biology during pregnancy in mice, rats, macaques, and humans. In contrast to macaques and humans, mice and rats exhibited an underwhelming induction in plasma GDF15 levels in response to pregnancy (∼75-fold increase in macaques vs. ∼2-fold increase in rodents). The changes in circulating GDF15 levels were corroborated by the magnitude of Gdf15 mRNA and GDF15 protein expression in placentae from mice, rats, and macaques. These species-specific findings may help guide future studies focusing on GDF15 in pregnancy and on the evaluation of pharmacological strategies to interfere with GDF15-GFRAL signaling to treat severe nausea and HG.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the present study pregnancy-induced changes in circulating growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in rodents, rhesus macaques, and humans are mapped. In sum, it is demonstrated that humans and macaques exhibit a tremendous increase in placental and circulating GDF15 during pregnancy. In contrast, GDF15 is negligibly increased in pregnant mice and rats, questioning a physiological role for GDF15 in pregnancy in rodents.<sep>Medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs), which are fatty acids with chain lengths of 8 to 12 carbon atoms, have been shown to reduce food intake in rodents and humans, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Unlike most other fatty acids, MCFAs are absorbed from the intestine into the portal vein and enter first the liver. We thus hypothesized that MCFAs trigger the release of hepatic factors that reduce appetite. The liver transcriptome in mice that were orally administered MCFAs as C8:0 triacylglycerol (TG) was analyzed. Circulating growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), tissue Gdf15 mRNA and food intake were investigated after acute oral gavage of MCFAs as C8:0 or C10:0 TG in mice. Effects of acute and subchronic administration of MCFAs as C8:0 TG on food intake and body weight were determined in mice lacking either the receptor for GDF15, GDNF Family Receptor Alpha Like (GFRAL), or GDF15. Hepatic and small intestinal expression of Gdf15 and circulating GDF15 increased after MCFAs ingestion, while intake of typical dietary long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) had no effect. Plasma GDF15 levels also increased in the portal vein with MCFA intake, indicating that in addition to the liver, the small intestine contributes to the rise in circulating GDF15. Acute oral provision of MCFAs decreased food intake over 24 hours compared with a LCFA-containing bolus, and this anorectic effect required the GDF15 receptor, GFRAL. Moreover, subchronic oral administration of MCFAs reduced body weight over 7 days, an effect that was blunted in mice lacking either GDF15 or GFRAL. We have identified ingestion of MCFAs as a novel nutritional approach that increases circulating GDF15 in mice and have revealed that the GDF15-GFRAL axis is required for the full anorectic effect of MCFAs.<sep>Abstract Background Thyroid hormones regulate cardiac functions mainly via direct actions in the heart and binding to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms α1 and β. While the role of the most abundantly expressed isoform, TRα1, is widely studied and well characterized, the role of TRβ in regulating heart functions is still poorly understood, primarily due to the accompanying elevation of circulating thyroid hormone in mice lacking TRβ (TRβ-KO). However, their hyperthyroidism is ameliorated at thermoneutrality, which allows studying the role of TRβ without this confounding factor. Methods Here we non-invasively monitored heart rate in TRβ-KO mice over several days using radiotelemetry at different housing temperatures (22°C and 30°C), and upon T3 administration in comparison to wildtype animals. Results TRβ-KO mice displayed normal average heart rate at both 22°C and 30°C with only minor changes in heart rate frequency distribution, which was confirmed by independent electrocardiogram recordings in freely-moving conscious mice. Parasympathetic nerve activity was, however, impaired in TRβ-KO mice at 22°C, and only partly rescued at 30°C. As expected, oral treatment with pharmacological doses of T3 at 30°C led to tachycardia in wildtypes, accompanied by broader heart rate frequency distribution and increased heart weight, while TRβ-KO mice showed blunted tachycardia, as well as resistance to changes in heart rate frequency distribution and heart weight. At the molecular level, these observations were paralleled by a blunted cardiac mRNA induction of several important genes, including the pacemaker channels Hcn2 and Hcn4 , as well as Kcna7 . Conclusions The phenotyping of TRβ-KO mice conducted at thermoneutrality allows novel insights on the role of TRβ in cardiac functions in absence of the usual confounding hyperthyroidism. Even though TRβ is expressed at lower levels than TRα1 in the heart, our findings demonstrate an important role for this isoform in the cardiac response to thyroid hormones.<sep>Background: Pathological conditions of the thyroid hormone (TH) system are routinely diagnosed by using serum concentrations of thyrotropin (TSH), which is sufficient in most cases. However, in certain conditions, such as resistance to TH due to mutations in THRB (RTHb) or TSH-releasing pituitary adenoma (TSHoma), TSH may be insufficient for a correct diagnosis, even in combination with serum TH concentrations. Likewise, under TH replacement therapy, these parameters can be misleading and do not always allow optimal treatment. Hence, additional biomarkers to assess challenging clinical conditions would be highly beneficial. Methods: Data from untargeted multi-omics analyses of plasma samples from experimental thyrotoxicosis in human and mouse were exploited to identify proteins that might represent possible biomarkers of TH function. Subsequent mouse studies were used to identify the tissue of origin and the involvement of the two different TH receptors (TR). For in-depth characterization of the underlying cellular mechanisms, primary mouse cells were used. Results: The analysis of the plasma proteome data sets revealed 16 plasma proteins that were concordantly differentially abundant under thyroxine treatment compared with euthyroid controls across the two species. These originated predominantly from liver, spleen, and bone. Independent studies in a clinical cohort and different mouse models identified CD5L as the most robust putative biomarker under different serum TH states and treatment periods. In vitro studies revealed that CD5L originates from proinflammatory M1 macrophages, which are similar to liver-residing Kupffer cells, and is regulated by an indirect mechanism requiring the secretion of a yet unknown factor from hepatocytes. In agreement with the role of TRα1 in immune cells and the TRβ-dependent hepatocyte-derived signaling, the in vivo regulation of Cd5l expression depended on both TR isoforms. Conclusion: Our results identify several novel targets of TH action in serum, with CD5L as the most robust marker. Although further studies will be needed to validate the specificity of these targets, CD5L seems to be a promising candidate to assess TH action in hepatocyte-macrophage crosstalk.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/12805112", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5037905237", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5024121842", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A has a strong background in cell biology, particularly in cell culture, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, and biochemical techniques, which aligns well with the job description.

A component’s mechanical fault can result in excessive engine vibrations. Identification of the root cause of a vibration fault is a significant challenge for both engine manufacturers and operators. This paper presents a case study of vibration fault detection and isolation applied at a Rolls-Royce T-56 turboprop engine. In this paper, the end-to-end fault diagnosis process from starting system faults to the isolation of the engine’s shaft that caused excessive vibrations is described. This work contributes to enhancing the understanding of turboprop engine behaviour under vibration conditions and highlights the merit of combing information from technical logs, maintenance manuals and engineering judgment in successful fault diagnosis.<sep>This paper proposes a diagnostic technique that can predict component degradation for a number of complex systems. It improves and clarifies the capabilities of a previously proposed diagnostic approach, by identifying the degradation severity of the examined components, and uses a 3D Principal Component Analysis approach to provide an explanation for the observed diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic results are then used, in a systematic way, to influence maintenance decisions. Having been developed for the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), the flexibility and power of the diagnostic methodology is shown by applying it to a completely new system, the Environmental Control System (ECS). A major conclusion of this work is that the proposed diagnostic approach is able to correctly predict the health state of two aircraft systems, and potentially many more, even in cases where different fault combinations result in similar fault patterns. Based on the engineering simulation approach verified here, a diagnostic methodology suitable from aircraft conception to retirement is proposed.<sep>Health monitoring of aircraft systems is of great interest to aircraft manufacturers and operators because it minimises the aircraft downtime (due to avoiding unscheduled maintenance), which in turn reduces the operating costs. The work that is presented in this paper explores, for a Boeing 747 APU, fault simulation and diagnostics for single and multiple component faults. Data that corresponds to healthy and faulty conditions is generated by a calibrated simulation model, and a set of performance parameters (symptom vector) are selected to characterise the components health state. For each component under examination, a classification algorithm is used to identify its health state (healthy or faulty) and the training strategy that is used considers the existence of multiple faults in the system. The proposed diagnostic technique is tested against single and multiple fault cases and shows good results for the compressor, turbine, Load Control Valve (LCV) and Fuel Metering Valve (FMV), even though these faults present similar fault patterns. On the contrary, the classifiers for the Speed Sensor (SS) and the generator do not provide reliable predictions. As regards the SS, the sensitivity assessment for this component showed that the existence of faults in the other components can sometimes mask the SS fault. The reason that the generator diagnosis fails under the proposed diagnostic technique is attributed to the fact that it has only a very slight influence on the other symptom vector parameters. In both cases, additional diagnostic strategies are suggested.<sep>Abstract Auxiliary power units (APUs) are a major driver of maintenance on civil aircraft. However, experimental data and performance simulations are rarely seen in public domain literature. While there is recourse to aircraft engine experience, this does not address the loading and the failure modes of an APU. This work aims to add to the literature, by experimentally investigating a Boeing 747 APU, collecting data under various power settings and ambient conditions, and using these data to calibrate a simple simulation model. This simulation model will subsequently be used to explore failure modes in the APU and hence what sensors may be needed for health monitoring purposes in future work. In this paper, a Boeing 747 APU rig development process and the testing strategy are presented. The rig is validated through a process that includes uncertainty analysis, repeatability tests, consistency tests, and comparison of the collected data with the calibrated simulation model. The results from the rig's validation indicate that the data collected from the APU is independent of its running time or the order of loading cycles imposed on it, i.e., the results are path independent. Changes in pneumatic and electrical power result in small changes in the rotational speed despite the fact that the rotational speed should remain constant. The rotational speed shows a slightly increasing trend when the extracted power rises, and this affects the APU thermodynamic characteristics. This work has resulted in a calibrated simulation model that will be further used in examining fault mode scenarios, as injecting these directly into the rig is seen as high risk.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Trouble shooting<sep>Peening<sep>Computer simulation<sep>Vibration<sep>Sensitivity (control systems)<sep>Shot peening<sep>Multidisciplinary approach<sep>Randomness<sep>Damper<sep>Finite element method<sep>Shot (pellet)</keyword><title>A bibliometric analysis of the research on shot peening<sep>Literature review of numerical simulation and optimisation of the shot peening process<sep>Objective and subjective measurements of the influence of dampers on the shooting experience of barebow archers<sep>Analysis of preferred weight configuration for barebow shooting style</title><abstract>A bibliometric analysis of shot peening was carried out to provide insights into academic activities and trends of the research on surface treatment processes from 1997 to 2017 based on the publications collected from the database Science Citation Index. The analysis identified those countries, institutions, foundations, and journals which performed well in the research field of shot peening, and illustrated the collaborative relationships between countries and between institutions, respectively. The results suggest that the two subject categories, i.e. material science multidisciplinary and engineering mechanical, had the largest publication outputs, and that finite element modelling, ultrasonic shot peening, and parameters optimization were the current hotspots. They also indicate that the current and future research should be focused on four aspects: (1) finite element analysis with new methods such as discrete element method for modelling; (2) ultrasonic shot peening as a counterpart in modifying properties of metallic surface; (3) parametric optimization with advanced algorithms; (4) plasma nitriding as a complementary process applying after shot peening treatment.<sep>This work provides a comprehensive review of numerical simulation and optimisation of the shot peening found in the existing literature over the past 10 years. The review found that the developed numerical models coupling finite elements with discrete elements became increasingly mature and showed their advantages in incorporating flow behaviour and randomness of shots. High emphasis must be placed on the constitutive equations of target material where its strain-rate sensitivity, cyclic behaviour and Bauschinger effects are recommended to be incorporated in the numerical material model simultaneously since considering one of them in isolation may lead to unreliable distribution of residual stresses. Furthermore, material hardening is a critical benefit of shot peening; however, it has not received its deserved attention from the existing investigations, neither in simulation nor in optimisation. The study found that intensity and coverage are two critical control parameters recommended to be constraints for optimisation of shot peening. Finally, this work also found that developed heuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithms have recently showed their advantages for searching optimal combinations of peening parameters. It is plausible that in the near future, the synergy of combining these algorithms with approximation models can be expected to gain more attention by researchers.<sep>The barebow archery shooting style previously limited the stabilisation system to weights connected to the riser, which is the central part of the bow, but recently the use of damping devices has been allowed. No scientific study is available to evaluate the effect of damping on the archers’ shooting experience. A human-centred methodology was developed to address this problem. Objective metrics (measurable quantities) and subjective metrics (archers’ sensations using the equipment) were defined. These metrics were correlated to obtain a deeper understanding of the problem. Fifty-one weight configurations were tested for mechanical vibrations and sound of the bow on shooting. The mechanical vibration was measured at five positions on the bow. Fifteen configurations were selected and tested by eight archers to evaluate the subjective metrics. The results show that dedicated vibration-damping devices are capable of significantly reducing the mechanical vibrations and the intensity and pitch of the sound of the bow on shooting. A strong correlation exists between reduced vibrations, lower intensity and pitch* of the sound of the bow and the quality of the shooting experience. The methodology used in this work was successful in fostering an understanding of the relationship between objective and subjective metrics on shooting. The results of this analysis could be used to improve existing designs or create new products for archery.<sep>The barebow archery shooting style limits the stabilisation system to weights connected to the riser, which is the central part of the bow. No scientific study is available to guide the barebow archer in the choice of the best weight configuration. In the following work, a human-centred methodology was developed to address this problem from both a scientific and user-oriented perspective. The proposed methodology is based on subjective metrics (archers’ sensations using the equipment), objective metrics (measurable quantities) and precision. The study sought a correlation between the subjective and objective metrics to provide insight into the problem of configuring a bow. Eleven weight configurations were considered. The vibration was measured at five positions on the bow and the 3D dynamic motion was measured using an inertial measurement unit. Seven archers completed a questionnaire to evaluate the subjective shooting sensations. The results show that the two best weight configurations are the 250–200 g and the 350–200 g, at the central and lower attachment points, respectively. A strong correlation exists between the vibration level of the bow and the feeling archers associated with the shooting, and between the dynamic motion of the bow and the comfort of the shooting. No correlation was found between the vibration time and the physical sensations felt by the archers. Determining the influence of the weight configuration on shooting accuracy, with statistical significance, would require an impractically large number of arrows to be shot for each weight configuration. A new methodology was developed to correlate the archers’ physical sensations to measurable parameters and this was applied to understand the barebow weight selection problem. This methodology could be further developed to correlate additional subjective and objective metrics. An understanding of these correlations would allow objective metrics, which can be simulated in the design process, to be used to ensure satisfaction of subjective metrics by the final design.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/84693/augmented-reality-researcher-ktp-associate-/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5000900265", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5048971424", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in fault diagnosis, vibration analysis, and system-level diagnostics, which aligns well with the job's requirements for developing wearable video displays and controls in rugged environments.

However, persistent antigen exposure is detrimental for T cell function. How TMB affects CD4 and CD8 T cell differentiation in untreated tumours, and whether this affects patient outcomes is unknown. Here we paired high-dimensional flow cytometry, exome, single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing from patients with resected, untreated NSCLC to examine these relationships. TMB was associated with compartment-wide T cell differentiation skewing, characterized by loss of TCF7-expressing progenitor-like CD4 T cells, and an increased abundance of dysfunctional CD8 and CD4 T cell subsets, with significant phenotypic and transcriptional similarity to neoantigen-reactive CD8 T cells. A gene signature of redistribution from progenitor-like to dysfunctional states associated with poor survival in lung and other cancer cohorts. Single-cell characterization of these populations informs potential strategies for therapeutic manipulation in NSCLC.<sep>The introduction of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer grading system has furthered interest in histopathological grading for risk stratification in lung adenocarcinoma. Complex morphology and high intratumoral heterogeneity present challenges to pathologists, prompting the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Here we developed ANORAK (pyrAmid pooliNg crOss stReam Attention networK), encoding multiresolution inputs with an attention mechanism, to delineate growth patterns from hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. In 1,372 lung adenocarcinomas across four independent cohorts, AI-based grading was prognostic of disease-free survival, and further assisted pathologists by consistently improving prognostication in stage I tumors. Tumors with discrepant patterns between AI and pathologists had notably higher intratumoral heterogeneity. Furthermore, ANORAK facilitates the morphological and spatial assessment of the acinar pattern, capturing acinus variations with pattern transition. Collectively, our AI method enabled the precision quantification and morphology investigation of growth patterns, reflecting intratumoral histological transitions in lung adenocarcinoma.<sep>Murine tissues harbor signature γδ T cell compartments with profound yet differential impacts on carcinogenesis. Conversely, human tissue-resident γδ cells are less well defined. In the present study, we show that human lung tissues harbor a resident Vδ1 γδ T cell population. Moreover, we demonstrate that Vδ1 T cells with resident memory and effector memory phenotypes were enriched in lung tumors compared with nontumor lung tissues. Intratumoral Vδ1 T cells possessed stem-like features and were skewed toward cytolysis and helper T cell type 1 function, akin to intratumoral natural killer and CD8+ T cells considered beneficial to the patient. Indeed, ongoing remission post-surgery was significantly associated with the numbers of CD45RA-CD27- effector memory Vδ1 T cells in tumors and, most strikingly, with the numbers of CD103+ tissue-resident Vδ1 T cells in nonmalignant lung tissues. Our findings offer basic insights into human body surface immunology that collectively support integrating Vδ1 T cell biology into immunotherapeutic strategies for nonsmall cell lung cancer.<sep>Intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) fuels lung cancer evolution, which leads to immune evasion and resistance to therapy1. Here, using paired whole-exome and RNA sequencing data, we investigate intratumour transcriptomic diversity in 354 non-small cell lung cancer tumours from 347 out of the first 421 patients prospectively recruited into the TRACERx study2,3. Analyses of 947 tumour regions, representing both primary and metastatic disease, alongside 96 tumour-adjacent normal tissue samples implicate the transcriptome as a major source of phenotypic variation. Gene expression levels and ITH relate to patterns of positive and negative selection during tumour evolution. We observe frequent copy number-independent allele-specific expression that is linked to epigenomic dysfunction. Allele-specific expression can also result in genomic-transcriptomic parallel evolution, which converges on cancer gene disruption. We extract signatures of RNA single-base substitutions and link their aetiology to the activity of the RNA-editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC3A, thereby revealing otherwise undetected ongoing APOBEC activity in tumours. Characterizing the transcriptomes of primary-metastatic tumour pairs, we combine multiple machine-learning approaches that leverage genomic and transcriptomic variables to link metastasis-seeding potential to the evolutionary context of mutations and increased proliferation within primary tumour regions. These results highlight the interplay between the genome and transcriptome in influencing ITH, lung cancer evolution and metastasis.<sep>Abstract B cells are frequently found in the margins of solid tumours as organized follicles in ectopic lymphoid organs called tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) 1,2 . Although TLS have been found to correlate with improved patient survival and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the underlying mechanisms of this association remain elusive 1,2 . Here we investigate lung-resident B cell responses in patients from the TRACERx 421 (Tracking Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Evolution Through Therapy) and other lung cancer cohorts, and in a recently established immunogenic mouse model for lung adenocarcinoma 3 . We find that both human and mouse lung adenocarcinomas elicit local germinal centre responses and tumour-binding antibodies, and further identify endogenous retrovirus (ERV) envelope glycoproteins as a dominant anti-tumour antibody target. ERV-targeting B cell responses are amplified by ICB in both humans and mice, and by targeted inhibition of KRAS(G12C) in the mouse model. ERV-reactive antibodies exert anti-tumour activity that extends survival in the mouse model, and ERV expression predicts the outcome of ICB in human lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, we find that effective immunotherapy in the mouse model requires CXCL13-dependent TLS formation. Conversely, therapeutic CXCL13 treatment potentiates anti-tumour immunity and synergizes with ICB. Our findings provide a possible mechanistic basis for the association of TLS with immunotherapy response.<sep>A complete understanding of how exposure to environmental substances promotes cancer formation is lacking. More than 70 years ago, tumorigenesis was proposed to occur in a two-step process: an initiating step that induces mutations in healthy cells, followed by a promoter step that triggers cancer development1. Here we propose that environmental particulate matter measuring ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), known to be associated with lung cancer risk, promotes lung cancer by acting on cells that harbour pre-existing oncogenic mutations in healthy lung tissue. Focusing on EGFR-driven lung cancer, which is more common in never-smokers or light smokers, we found a significant association between PM2.5 levels and the incidence of lung cancer for 32,957 EGFR-driven lung cancer cases in four within-country cohorts. Functional mouse models revealed that air pollutants cause an influx of macrophages into the lung and release of interleukin-1β. This process results in a progenitor-like cell state within EGFR mutant lung alveolar type II epithelial cells that fuels tumorigenesis. Ultradeep mutational profiling of histologically normal lung tissue from 295 individuals across 3 clinical cohorts revealed oncogenic EGFR and KRAS driver mutations in 18% and 53% of healthy tissue samples, respectively. These findings collectively support a tumour-promoting role for PM2.5 air pollutants and provide impetus for public health policy initiatives to address air pollution to reduce disease burden.<sep>The immune microenvironment influences tumour evolution and can be both prognostic and predict response to immunotherapy1,2. However, measurements of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are limited by a shortage of appropriate data. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of DNA is frequently performed to calculate tumour mutational burden and identify actionable mutations. Here we develop T cell exome TREC tool (T cell ExTRECT), a method for estimation of T cell fraction from WES samples using a signal from T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) loss during V(D)J recombination of the T cell receptor-α gene (TCRA (also known as TRA)). TCRA T cell fraction correlates with orthogonal TIL estimates and is agnostic to sample type. Blood TCRA T cell fraction is higher in females than in males and correlates with both tumour immune infiltrate and presence of bacterial sequencing reads. Tumour TCRA T cell fraction is prognostic in lung adenocarcinoma. Using a meta-analysis of tumours treated with immunotherapy, we show that tumour TCRA T cell fraction predicts immunotherapy response, providing value beyond measuring tumour mutational burden. Applying T cell ExTRECT to a multi-sample pan-cancer cohort reveals a high diversity of the degree of immune infiltration within tumours. Subclonal loss of 12q24.31-32, encompassing SPPL3, is associated with reduced TCRA T cell fraction. T cell ExTRECT provides a cost-effective technique to characterize immune infiltrate alongside somatic changes.<sep>Abstract Metastatic disease is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths 1 . We report the longitudinal evolutionary analysis of 126 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours from 421 prospectively recruited patients in TRACERx who developed metastatic disease, compared with a control cohort of 144 non-metastatic tumours. In 25% of cases, metastases diverged early, before the last clonal sweep in the primary tumour, and early divergence was enriched for patients who were smokers at the time of initial diagnosis. Simulations suggested that early metastatic divergence more frequently occurred at smaller tumour diameters (less than 8 mm). Single-region primary tumour sampling resulted in 83% of late divergence cases being misclassified as early, highlighting the importance of extensive primary tumour sampling. Polyclonal dissemination, which was associated with extrathoracic disease recurrence, was found in 32% of cases. Primary lymph node disease contributed to metastatic relapse in less than 20% of cases, representing a hallmark of metastatic potential rather than a route to subsequent recurrences/disease progression. Metastasis-seeding subclones exhibited subclonal expansions within primary tumours, probably reflecting positive selection. Our findings highlight the importance of selection in metastatic clone evolution within untreated primary tumours, the distinction between monoclonal versus polyclonal seeding in dictating site of recurrence, the limitations of current radiological screening approaches for early diverging tumours and the need to develop strategies to target metastasis-seeding subclones before relapse.<sep>Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be used to detect and profile residual tumour cells persisting after curative intent therapy1. The study of large patient cohorts incorporating longitudinal plasma sampling and extended follow-up is required to determine the role of ctDNA as a phylogenetic biomarker of relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we developed ctDNA methods tracking a median of 200 mutations identified in resected NSCLC tissue across 1,069 plasma samples collected from 197 patients enrolled in the TRACERx study2. A lack of preoperative ctDNA detection distinguished biologically indolent lung adenocarcinoma with good clinical outcome. Postoperative plasma analyses were interpreted within the context of standard-of-care radiological surveillance and administration of cytotoxic adjuvant therapy. Landmark analyses of plasma samples collected within 120 days after surgery revealed ctDNA detection in 25% of patients, including 49% of all patients who experienced clinical relapse; 3 to 6 monthly ctDNA surveillance identified impending disease relapse in an additional 20% of landmark-negative patients. We developed a bioinformatic tool (ECLIPSE) for non-invasive tracking of subclonal architecture at low ctDNA levels. ECLIPSE identified patients with polyclonal metastatic dissemination, which was associated with a poor clinical outcome. By measuring subclone cancer cell fractions in preoperative plasma, we found that subclones seeding future metastases were significantly more expanded compared with non-metastatic subclones. Our findings will support (neo)adjuvant trial advances and provide insights into the process of metastatic dissemination using low-ctDNA-level liquid biopsy.<sep>Lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) display a broad histological spectrum from low-grade lepidic tumors through to mid-grade acinar and papillary and high-grade solid, cribriform and micropapillary tumors. How morphology reflects tumor evolution and disease progression is poorly understood. Whole-exome sequencing data generated from 805 primary tumor regions and 121 paired metastatic samples across 248 LUADs from the TRACERx 421 cohort, together with RNA-sequencing data from 463 primary tumor regions, were integrated with detailed whole-tumor and regional histopathological analysis. Tumors with predominantly high-grade patterns showed increased chromosomal complexity, with higher burden of loss of heterozygosity and subclonal somatic copy number alterations. Individual regions in predominantly high-grade pattern tumors exhibited higher proliferation and lower clonal diversity, potentially reflecting large recent subclonal expansions. Co-occurrence of truncal loss of chromosomes 3p and 3q was enriched in predominantly low-/mid-grade tumors, while purely undifferentiated solid-pattern tumors had a higher frequency of truncal arm or focal 3q gains and SMARCA4 gene alterations compared with mixed-pattern tumors with a solid component, suggesting distinct evolutionary trajectories. Clonal evolution analysis revealed that tumors tend to evolve toward higher-grade patterns. The presence of micropapillary pattern and 'tumor spread through air spaces' were associated with intrathoracic recurrence, in contrast to the presence of solid/cribriform patterns, necrosis and preoperative circulating tumor DNA detection, which were associated with extra-thoracic recurrence. These data provide insights into the relationship between LUAD morphology, the underlying evolutionary genomic landscape, and clinical and anatomical relapse risk.<sep>Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide 1 . Here we analysed 1,644 tumour regions sampled at surgery or during follow-up from the first 421 patients with non-small cell lung cancer prospectively enrolled into the TRACERx study. This project aims to decipher lung cancer evolution and address the primary study endpoint: determining the relationship between intratumour heterogeneity and clinical outcome. In lung adenocarcinoma, mutations in 22 out of 40 common cancer genes were under significant subclonal selection, including classical tumour initiators such as TP53 and KRAS . We defined evolutionary dependencies between drivers, mutational processes and whole genome doubling (WGD) events. Despite patients having a history of smoking, 8% of lung adenocarcinomas lacked evidence of tobacco-induced mutagenesis. These tumours also had similar detection rates for EGFR mutations and for RET , ROS1 , ALK and MET oncogenic isoforms compared with tumours in never-smokers, which suggests that they have a similar aetiology and pathogenesis. Large subclonal expansions were associated with positive subclonal selection. Patients with tumours harbouring recent subclonal expansions, on the terminus of a phylogenetic branch, had significantly shorter disease-free survival. Subclonal WGD was detected in 19% of tumours, and 10% of tumours harboured multiple subclonal WGDs in parallel. Subclonal, but not truncal, WGD was associated with shorter disease-free survival. Copy number heterogeneity was associated with extrathoracic relapse within 1 year after surgery. These data demonstrate the importance of clonal expansion, WGD and copy number instability in determining the timing and patterns of relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and provide a comprehensive clinical cancer evolutionary data resource.<sep>Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer. Key features of CAC include alterations in body composition and body weight. Here, we explore the association between body composition and body weight with survival and delineate potential biological processes and mediators that contribute to the development of CAC. Computed tomography-based body composition analysis of 651 individuals in the TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) study suggested that individuals in the bottom 20th percentile of the distribution of skeletal muscle or adipose tissue area at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, had significantly shorter lung cancer-specific survival and overall survival. This finding was validated in 420 individuals in the independent Boston Lung Cancer Study. Individuals classified as having developed CAC according to one or more features at relapse encompassing loss of adipose or muscle tissue, or body mass index-adjusted weight loss were found to have distinct tumor genomic and transcriptomic profiles compared with individuals who did not develop such features. Primary non-small cell lung cancers from individuals who developed CAC were characterized by enrichment of inflammatory signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transitional pathways, and differentially expressed genes upregulated in these tumors included cancer-testis antigen MAGEA6 and matrix metalloproteinases, such as ADAMTS3. In an exploratory proteomic analysis of circulating putative mediators of cachexia performed in a subset of 110 individuals from TRACERx, a significant association between circulating GDF15 and loss of body weight, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was identified at relapse, supporting the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting GDF15 in the management of CAC.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Microglia<sep>Anxiety<sep>FKBP5<sep>Mood disorders<sep>Refugee<sep>Triglyceride<sep>Receptor<sep>Glucocorticoid receptor<sep>HEK 293 cells<sep>Psychological intervention<sep>Psychopathology<sep>Neurodegeneration<sep>Agonist<sep>Transfection<sep>Gonad<sep>Somatic cell<sep>Lipid droplet<sep>Triglyceride lipase<sep>Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)<sep>SOD1<sep>Neocortex<sep>Superoxide dismutase<sep>Gene</keyword><title>Understanding the pathology of psychiatric disorders in refugees<sep>P2X7 receptor activation mediates superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) release from murine NSC-34 motor neurons<sep>Pharmacological and genetic characterisation of the canine P2X4 receptor<sep>A role for triglyceride lipase brummer in the regulation of sex differences in Drosophila fat storage and breakdown<sep>Associations of psychiatric disease and ageing with FKBP5 expression converge on superficial layer neurons of the neocortex</title><abstract>Displacement of people from their homes, families and countries is a current global crisis, with over 70 million people forcibly on the move. A substantial proportion of these people will end up in regions with a different language and culture, where they are registered as refugees or asylum seekers. Due to the underlying reasons for displacement (including conflicts, persecution or violation of human rights), displaced people are severely stress-exposed, which continues into their post-migration life and increases risk for developing psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders and mood disorders. While landmark studies have illustrated the increased prevalence of psychopathology in asylum seeker and refugee populations following pre-/post-displacement stress, few studies add to our understanding of the basic biological mechanisms underpinning risk to psychiatric disorders in these populations. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying resilience despite significant adversity remain unclear. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the development of psychiatric disorders in refugees can propel treatments (both drug and non-drug) that are capable of influencing biology at the molecular level, and the design of interventions. In the following review, we summarise the status quo of research investigating the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders in refugees, and propose new ways to address gaps in knowledge with multidisciplinary research.<sep>Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) can be constitutively released from motor neurons and transmitted to naïve motor neurons to promote the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the biological impacts of this process and the precise mechanisms of SOD1 release remain to be fully resolved. Using biochemical and fluorescent techniques, this study aimed to determine if P2X7 receptor activation could induce mutant SOD1 release from motor neurons and whether this released SOD1 could be transmitted to motor neurons or microglia to mediate effects associated with neurodegeneration in ALS. Aggregated SOD1G93A, released from murine NSC-34 motor neurons transiently transfected with SOD1G93A, could be transmitted to naïve NSC-34 cells and murine EOC13 microglia to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) release, respectively. Immunoblotting revealed NSC-34 cells expressed P2X7. Extracellular ATP induced cation dye uptake into these cells, which was blocked by the P2X7 antagonist AZ10606120, demonstrating these cells express functional P2X7. Moreover, ATP induced the rapid release of aggregated SOD1G93A from NSC-34 cells transiently transfected with SOD1G93A, a process blocked by AZ10606120 and revealing a role for P2X7 in this process. ATP-induced SOD1G93A release coincided with membrane blebbing. Finally, aggregated SOD1G93A released via P2X7 activation could also be transmitted to NSC-34 and EOC13 cells to induce ER stress and TNFα release, respectively. Collectively, these results identify a novel role for P2X7 in the prion-like propagation of SOD1 in ALS and provide a possible explanation for the therapeutic benefits of P2X7 antagonism previously observed in ALS SOD1G93A mice.<sep>Background and Purpose P2X4 receptors are emerging therapeutic targets for treating chronic pain and cardiovascular disease. Dogs are well‐recognised natural models of human disease, but information regarding P2X4 receptors in dogs is lacking. To aid the development and validation of P2X4 receptor ligands, we have characterised and compared canine and human P2X4 receptors. Experimental Approach Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples from 101 randomly selected dogs and sequenced across the P2RX4 gene to identify potential missense variants. Recombinant canine and human P2X4 receptors tagged with Emerald GFP were expressed in 1321N1 and HEK293 cells and analysed by immunoblotting and confocal microscopy. In these cells, receptor pharmacology was characterised using nucleotide‐induced Fura‐2 AM measurements of intracellular Ca 2+ and known P2X4 receptor antagonists. P2X4 receptor‐mediated inward currents in HEK293 cells were assessed by automated patch clamp. Key Results No P2RX4 missense variants were identified in any canine samples. Canine and human P2X4 receptors were localised primarily to lysosomal compartments. ATP was the primary agonist of canine P2X4 receptors with near identical efficacy and potency at human receptors. 2′(3′)‐ O ‐(4‐benzoylbenzoyl)‐ATP, but not ADP, was a partial agonist with reduced potency for canine P2X4 receptors compared to the human orthologues. Five antagonists inhibited canine P2X4 receptors, with 1‐(2,6‐dibromo‐4‐isopropyl‐phenyl)‐3‐(3‐pyridyl)urea displaying reduced sensitivity and potency at canine P2X4 receptors. Conclusion and Implications P2X4 receptors are highly conserved across dog pedigrees and display expression patterns and pharmacological profiles similar to human receptors, supporting validation and use of therapeutic agents for P2X4 receptor‐related disease onset and management in dogs and humans.<sep>Triglycerides are the major form of stored fat in all animals. One important determinant of whole-body fat storage is whether an animal is male or female. Here, we use Drosophila , an established model for studies on triglyceride metabolism, to gain insight into the genes and physiological mechanisms that contribute to sex differences in fat storage. Our analysis of triglyceride storage and breakdown in both sexes identified a role for triglyceride lipase brummer ( bmm ) in the regulation of sex differences in triglyceride homeostasis. Normally, male flies have higher levels of bmm mRNA both under normal culture conditions and in response to starvation, a lipolytic stimulus. We find that loss of bmm largely eliminates the sex difference in triglyceride storage and abolishes the sex difference in triglyceride breakdown via strongly male-biased effects. Although we show that bmm function in the fat body affects whole-body triglyceride levels in both sexes, in males, we identify an additional role for bmm function in the somatic cells of the gonad and in neurons in the regulation of whole-body triglyceride homeostasis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that lipid droplets are normally present in both the somatic cells of the male gonad and in neurons, revealing a previously unrecognized role for bmm function, and possibly lipid droplets, in these cell types in the regulation of whole-body triglyceride homeostasis. Taken together, our data reveal a role for bmm function in the somatic cells of the gonad and in neurons in the regulation of male–female differences in fat storage and breakdown and identify bmm as a link between the regulation of triglyceride homeostasis and biological sex.<sep>Identification and characterisation of novel targets for treatment is a priority in the field of psychiatry. FKBP5 is a gene with decades of evidence suggesting its pathogenic role in a subset of psychiatric patients, with potential to be leveraged as a therapeutic target for these individuals. While it is widely reported that FKBP5/FKBP51 mRNA/protein (FKBP5/1) expression is impacted by psychiatric disease state, risk genotype and age, it is not known in which cell types and sub-anatomical areas of the human brain this occurs. This knowledge is critical to propel FKBP5/1-targeted treatment development. Here, we performed an extensive, large-scale postmortem study (n = 1024) of FKBP5/1, examining neocortical areas (BA9, BA11 and ventral BA24/BA24a) derived from subjects that lived with schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder. With an extensive battery of RNA (bulk RNA sequencing, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, microarray, qPCR, RNAscope) and protein (immunoblot, immunohistochemistry) analysis approaches, we thoroughly investigated the effects of disease state, ageing and genotype on cortical FKBP5/1 expression including in a cell type-specific manner. We identified consistently heightened FKBP5/1 levels in psychopathology and with age, but not genotype, with these effects strongest in schizophrenia. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq; BA9 and BA11) and targeted histology (BA9, BA24a), we established that these disease and ageing effects on FKBP5/1 expression were most pronounced in excitatory superficial layer neurons of the neocortex, and this effect appeared to be consistent in both the granular and agranular areas examined. We then found that this increase in FKBP5 levels may impact on synaptic plasticity, as FKBP5 gex levels strongly and inversely correlated with dendritic mushroom spine density and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in superficial layer neurons in BA11. These findings pinpoint a novel cellular and molecular mechanism that has potential to open a new avenue of FKBP51 drug development to treat cognitive symptoms in psychiatric disorders.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/349644/research-technical-support-attendant-systems-biology-ireland-school-of-medicine/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5038427172", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5026998564", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in molecular biology, cancer research, and genomics, which aligns closely with the requirements of the Research Technical Support Attendant role, particularly in managing molecular biology curriculum and laboratory supplies.

Uhlen et al. performed a global expression analysis of human blood cell types and integrated this data with data across all major human tissues and organs in the human protein atlas. This comprehensive compendium allows for classification of all human protein-coding genes with regard to their tissue- and cell-type distribution. Science , this issue p. eaax9198<sep>Targeted proteomics is an attractive approach for the analysis of blood proteins. Here, we describe a novel analytical platform based on isotope-labeled recombinant protein standards stored in a chaotropic agent and subsequently dried down to allow storage at ambient temperature. This enables a straightforward protocol suitable for robotic workstations. Plasma samples to be analyzed are simply added to the dried pellet followed by enzymatic treatment and mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we show that this approach can be used to precisely (coefficient of variation <10%) determine the absolute concentrations in human plasma of hundred clinically relevant protein targets, spanning four orders of magnitude, using simultaneous analysis of 292 peptides. The use of this next-generation analytical platform for high-throughput clinical proteome profiling is discussed.<sep>Protein quantification strategies using multiple proteases have been shown to deliver poor interprotease accuracy in label-free mass spectrometry experiments. By utilizing six different proteases with different cleavage sites, this study explores the protease bias and its effect on accuracy and precision by using recombinant protein standards. We established 557 SRM assays, using a recombinant protein standard resource, toward 10 proteins in human plasma and determined their concentration with multiple proteases. The quantified peptides of these plasma proteins spanned 3 orders of magnitude (0.02–70 μM). In total, 60 peptides were used for absolute quantification and the majority of the peptides showed high robustness. The retained reproducibility was achieved by quantifying plasma proteins using spiked stable isotope standard recombinant proteins in a targeted proteomics workflow.<sep>The association of pyruvate kinase muscle type (PKM) with survival of cancer patients is controversial. Here, we focus on different transcripts of PKM and investigate the association between their mRNA expression and the clinical survival of the patients in 25 different cancers. We find that the transcripts encoding PKM2, and three previously unstudied transcripts, namely ENS0389093, ENS0568883 and ENS0561609, exhibited opposite prognostic indications in different cancers. Moreover, we validate the prognostic effect of these transcripts in an independent kidney cancer cohort. Finally, we reveal that ENS0389093 and ENS0568883 possess pyruvate kinase enzymatic activity and could have functional roles in metabolism, cell invasion and hypoxia response in cancer cells. Our study provided a potential explanation to the controversial prognostic indication of PKM, and could invoke future studies focusing on revealing the biological and oncological role of these alternative spliced variants of PKM.<sep>Recombinant protein production can cause severe stress on cellular metabolism, resulting in limited titer and product quality. To investigate cellular and metabolic characteristics associated with these limitations, we compare HEK293 clones producing either erythropoietin (EPO) (secretory) or GFP (non-secretory) protein at different rates. Transcriptomic and functional analyses indicate significantly higher metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation in EPO producers compared with parental and GFP cells. In addition, ribosomal genes exhibit specific expression patterns depending on the recombinant protein and the production rate. In a clone displaying a dramatically increased EPO secretion, we detect higher gene expression related to negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including upregulation of ATF6B, which aids EPO production in a subset of clones by overexpression or small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown. Our results offer potential target pathways and genes for further development of the secretory power in mammalian cell factories.<sep>Bacteria must balance the different needs for substrate assimilation, growth functions, and resilience in order to thrive in their environment. Of all cellular macromolecules, the bacterial proteome is by far the most important resource and its size is limited. Here, we investigated how the highly versatile 'knallgas' bacterium Cupriavidus necator reallocates protein resources when grown on different limiting substrates and with different growth rates. We determined protein quantity by mass spectrometry and estimated enzyme utilization by resource balance analysis modeling. We found that C. necator invests a large fraction of its proteome in functions that are hardly utilized. Of the enzymes that are utilized, many are present in excess abundance. One prominent example is the strong expression of CBB cycle genes such as Rubisco during growth on fructose. Modeling and mutant competition experiments suggest that CO2-reassimilation through Rubisco does not provide a fitness benefit for heterotrophic growth, but is rather an investment in readiness for autotrophy.<sep>Mass spectrometry based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) has developed into a powerful quantitative tool with a variety of implications, including precision medicine. Combined with stable isotope recombinant protein standards, this strategy provides confident protein identification and precise quantification on an absolute scale. Here, we describe a comprehensive targeted proteomics approach to profile a pan-cancer cohort consisting of 1800 blood plasma samples representing 15 different cancer types. We successfully performed an absolute quantification of 253 proteins in multiplex. The assay had low intra-assay variability with a coefficient of variation below 20% (CV = 17.2%) for a total of 1013 peptides quantified across almost two thousand injections. This study identified a potential biomarker panel of seven protein targets for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma patients using differential expression analysis and machine learning. The combination of markers, including the complement C1 complex, JCHAIN, and CD5L, resulted in a prediction model with an AUC of 0.96 for the identification of multiple myeloma patients across various cancer patients. All these proteins are known to interact with immunoglobulins.<sep>ABSTRACT The association of pyruvate kinase muscle type ( PKM ) with survival of cancer patients is controversial. Here, we focus on different transcripts of PKM and investigate the association between their mRNA expression and the clinical survival of the patients in 25 different cancers. We find that the transcript encoding PKM2, and three other functional transcripts are prognostic in multiple cancers. Our integrative analysis shows that the functions of these four transcripts are highly conservative in different cancers. Next, we validate the prognostic effect of these transcripts in an independent kidney renal clear-cell carcinoma (KIRC) cohort and identify a prognostic signature which could distinguish high- and low-risk KIRC patients. Finally, we reveal the functional role of alternatively spliced PKM transcripts in KIRC, and discover the protein products of different transcripts of PKM . Our analysis demonstrated that alternatively spliced transcripts of not only PKM but also other genes should be considered in cancer studies, since it may enable the discovery and targeting of the right protein product for development of the efficient treatment strategies.<sep>Lipoprotein(a), also known as Lp(a), is an LDL-like particle composed of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) bound covalently to apolipoprotein B100. Plasma concentrations of Lp(a) are highly heritable and vary widely between individuals. Elevated plasma concentration of Lp(a) is considered as an independent, causal risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Targeted mass spectrometry (LC-SRM/MS) combined with stable isotope-labeled recombinant proteins provides robust and precise quantification of proteins in the blood, making LC-SRM/MS assays appealing for monitoring plasma proteins for clinical implications. This study presents a novel quantitative approach, based on proteotypic peptides, to determine the absolute concentration of apo(a) from two microliters of plasma and qualified according to guideline requirements for targeted proteomics assays. After optimization, assay parameters such as linearity, lower limits of quantification (LLOQ), intra-assay variability (CV: 4.7%) and inter-assay repeatability (CV: 7.8%) were determined and the LC-SRM/MS results were benchmarked against a commercially available immunoassay. In summary, the measurements of an apo(a) single copy specific peptide and a kringle 4 specific peptide allow for the determination of molar concentration and relative size of apo(a) in individuals.<sep>Mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomics is rapidly evolving and routinely applied in large-scale biomedical studies. Proteases are a central component of every bottom-up proteomics experiment, digesting proteins into peptides. Trypsin has been the most widely applied protease in proteomics due to its characteristics. With ever-larger cohort sizes and possible future clinical application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the technical impact of trypsin becomes increasingly relevant. To assess possible biases introduced by trypsin digestion, we evaluated the impact of eight commercially available trypsins in a variety of bottom-up proteomics experiments and across a range of protease concentrations and storage times. To investigate the universal impact of these technical attributes, we included bulk HeLa cell lysate, human plasma, and single HEK293 cells, which were analyzed over a range of selected reaction monitoring (SRM), data-independent acquisition (DIA), and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) instrument methods on three LC-MS instruments. The quantification methods employed encompassed both label-free approaches and absolute quantification utilizing spike-in heavy-labeled recombinant protein fragment standards. Based on this extensive data set, we report variations between commercial trypsins, their source, and their concentration. Furthermore, we provide suggestions on the handling of trypsin in large-scale studies.<sep>Abstract Mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomics is rapidly evolving and routinely applied in large biomedical studies.

However, the association of PKM expression and the survival outcome of patients with different cancers is controversial. We employed systems biology methods to reveal prognostic value and potential biological functions of PKM transcripts in different human cancers. Protein products of transcripts were shown and detected by western blot and mass spectrometry analysis. We focused on different transcripts of PKM and investigated the associations between their mRNA expression and the clinical survival of the patients in 25 different cancers. We find that the transcripts encoding PKM2 and three previously unstudied transcripts, namely ENST00000389093, ENST00000568883, and ENST00000561609, exhibited opposite prognostic indications in different cancers.

Here, a quantitative method based on targeted proteomics analysis of plasma proteins using isotope-labeled recombinant standards originating from the Human Protein Atlas project has been established. The standards were individually quantified prior to being employed in the final multiplex assay. The assays are mainly directed toward actively secreted proteins produced in the liver, but may also originate from other parts of the human body. This study included 21 proteins classified by the FDA as either drug targets or approved clinical protein biomarkers. We describe the use of this multiplex assay for profiling a well-defined human cohort with sample collection spanning over a one-year period. Samples were collected at four different time points, which allowed for a longitudinal analysis to assess the variable plasma proteome within individuals. Two assays toward APOA1 and APOB had available clinical data, and the two assays were benchmarked against each other. The clinical assay is based on antibodies and shows high correlation between the two orthogonal methods, suggesting that targeted proteomics with highly parallel, multiplex analysis is an attractive alternative to antibody-based protein assays.<sep>Summary Bacteria must balance the different needs for substrate assimilation, growth functions, and resilience in order to thrive in their environment.

Highlights A large fraction of the C. necator proteome is not utilized and not essential Highly utilized enzymes are more abundant and less variable Autotrophy related enzymes are largely underutilized Re-assimilation of CO 2 via the CBB cycle is unlikely to provide a fitness benefit<sep>Reliable, robust, large-scale molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for monitoring the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We have developed a scalable analytical approach to detect viral proteins based on peptide immuno-affinity enrichment combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This is a multiplexed strategy, based on targeted proteomics analysis and read-out by LC-MS, capable of precisely quantifying and confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) swab media from combined throat/nasopharynx/saliva samples. The results reveal that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 measured by LC-MS correlate well with their correspondingreal-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) read-out (r = 0.79). The analytical workflow shows similar turnaround times as regular RT-PCR instrumentation with a quantitative read-out of viral proteins corresponding to cycle thresholds (Ct) equivalents ranging from 21 to 34. Using RT-PCR as a reference, we demonstrate that the LC-MS-based method has 100% negative percent agreement (estimated specificity) and 95% positive percent agreement (estimated sensitivity) when analyzing clinical samples collected from asymptomatic individuals with a Ct within the limit of detection of the mass spectrometer (Ct ≤ 30). These results suggest that a scalable analytical method based on LC-MS has a place in future pandemic preparedness centers to complement current virus detection technologies.<sep>The proteins secreted by human tissues and blood cells, the secretome, are important both for the basic understanding of human biology and for identification of potential targets for future diagnosis and therapy. Here, a high-throughput mammalian cell factory is presented that was established to create a resource of recombinant full-length proteins covering the majority of those annotated as ‘secreted’ in humans. The full-length DNA sequences of each of the predicted secreted proteins were generated by gene synthesis, the constructs were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the recombinant proteins were produced, purified and analyzed. Almost 1,300 proteins were successfully generated and proteins predicted to be secreted into the blood were produced with a success rate of 65%, while the success rates for the other categories of secreted proteins were somewhat lower giving an overall one-pass success rate of ca. 58%. The proteins were used to generate targeted proteomics assays and several of the proteins were shown to be active in a phenotypic assay involving pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation. Many of the proteins that failed during production in CHO cells could be rescued in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells suggesting that a cell factory of human origin can be an attractive alternative for production in mammalian cells. In conclusion, a high-throughput protein production and purification system has been successfully established to create a unique resource of the human secretome.<sep>Developing and implementing new patient-centric strategies for drug trials lowers the barrier to participation for some patients by reducing the need to travel to research sites. In early chronic kidney disease (CKD) trials, albuminuria is the key measure for determining treatment effect prior to pivotal kidney outcome trials.To facilitate albuminuria sample collection outside of a clinical research site, we developed 2 quantitative microsampling methods to determine the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). Readout was performed by LC-MS/MS.For the Mitra device the within-batch precision (CV%) was 2.8% to 4.6% and the between-batch precision was 5.3% to 6.1%. Corresponding data for the Capitainer device were 4.0% to 8.6% and 6.7% to 9.0%, respectively. The storage stability at room temperature for 3 weeks was 98% to 103% for both devices. The recovery for the Mitra and Capitainer devices was 104% (SD 7.0%) and 95 (SD 7.4%), respectively. The inter-assay comparison of UACR assessment generated results that were indistinguishable regardless of microsampling technique. The accuracy based on LC-MS/MS vs analysis of neat urine using a clinical chemistry analyzer was assessed in a clinical setting, resulting in 102 ± 8.0% for the Mitra device and 95 ± 10.0% for the Capitainer device.Both UACR microsampling measurements exhibit excellent accuracy and precision compared to a clinical chemistry analyzer using neat urine. We applied our patient-centric sampling strategy to subjects with heart failure in a clinical setting. Precise UACR measurements using quantitative microsampling at home would be beneficial in clinical drug development for kidney therapies.<sep>Stable isotope-labeled standard (SIS) peptides are used as internal standards in targeted proteomics to provide robust protein quantification, which is required in clinical settings. However, SIS peptides are typically added post trypsin digestion and, as the digestion efficiency can vary significantly between peptides within a protein, the accuracy and precision of the assay may be compromised. These drawbacks can be remedied by a new class of internal standards introduced by the Human Protein Atlas project, which are based on SIS recombinant protein fragments called SIS PrESTs. SIS PrESTs are added initially to the sample and SIS peptides are released on trypsin digestion. The SIS PrEST technology is promising for absolute quantification of protein biomarkers but has not previously been evaluated in a clinical setting. An automated and scalable solid phase extraction workflow for desalting and enrichment of plasma digests was established enabling simultaneous preparation of up to 96 samples. Robust high-precision quantification of 13 apolipoproteins was achieved using a novel multiplex SIS PrEST-based LC-SRM/MS Tier 2 assay in non-depleted human plasma. The assay exhibited inter-day coefficients of variation between 1.5% and 14.5% (median = 3.5%) and was subsequently used to investigate the effects of omega-3 carboxylic acids (OM3-CA) and fenofibrate on these 13 apolipoproteins in human plasma samples from a randomized placebo-controlled trial, EFFECT I (NCT02354976). No significant changes were observed in the OM3-CA arm, whereas treatment with fenofibrate significantly increased apoAII and reduced apoB, apoCI, apoE and apoCIV levels. The reduction in apoCIV following fenofibrate treatment is a novel finding. The study demonstrates that SIS PrESTs can facilitate the generation of robust multiplexed biomarker Tier 2<sep>Abstract Background: Molecular components in blood, like proteins, are used as biomarkers to reveal or predict disease states, guide clinical interventions and aid development of therapies. While multiplexing proteomics methods promote discovery of such biomarkers, it is generally difficult to translate them to clinical use due to lack of substantial evidence regarding their reliability as quantifiable indicators of disease state or outcome. To overcome this challenge, a novel orthogonal strategy is developed and used to assess reliability of biomarkers and analytically corroborate already identified serum biomarkers for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a monogenic incurable disease characterized by progressive muscle damage currently lacking reliable and specific disease monitoring tools. Methods: Two technological platforms are used to detect and quantify the biomarkers in 72 longitudinally collected serum samples from DMD patients at 3 to 5 timepoints. Quantification of the biomarkers is achieved by detection of the same biomarker fragment either through interaction with validated antibodies in immuno-assays or through quantification of peptides by Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry assay (PRM-MS). Results: Out of ten previously identified biomarkers by immuno-based proteomics methods, five are confirmed using the mass spectrometry based method. Two biomarkers, carbonic anhydrase III and lactate dehydrogenase B, are quantified with two independent methods, sandwich immunoassays and PRM-MS, to a Pearson correlation of 0.92 and 0.946 respectively. The median concentration of CA3 and LDHB in DMD patients is elevated in comparison to healthy individuals to 35- and 3-fold, respectively. Levels of CA3 vary between 10.26 and 0.36 ng/ml in DMD patients whereas that of LDHB vary between 15.1 and 0.8 ng/ml.

Plant mitochondrial messenger RNAs (mRNAs) lack Shine-Dalgarno-like ribosome-binding sites, so it is unknown how plant mitoribosomes recognize mRNA. We show that “mitochondrial translation factors” mTRAN1 and mTRAN2 are land plant–specific proteins, required for normal mitochondrial respiration chain biogenesis. Our studies suggest that mTRANs are noncanonical pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)–like RNA binding proteins of the mitoribosomal “small” subunit. We identified conserved Adenosine (A)/Uridine (U)-rich motifs in the 5′ regions of plant mitochondrial mRNAs. mTRAN1 binds this motif, suggesting that it is a mitoribosome homing factor to identify mRNAs. We demonstrate that mTRANs are likely required for translation of all plant mitochondrial mRNAs. Plant mitochondrial translation initiation thus appears to use a protein-mRNA interaction that is divergent from bacteria or mammalian mitochondria.<sep>Pretreatment by reversible electroporation followed by resting (storage under saturated moisture at 21 ± 2 °C) was evaluated for modification of the properties of dried and rehydrated Thai basil leaves. The treated leaves were dried by convection at 40 °C or in a vacuum at room temperature. The results showed that vacuum drying provoked more cell damage and tissue collapse than convective air drying at a moisture ratio (MR) of 0.2 and 0.1. Under this level of MR, the pulsed electric field (PEF) and resting pretreatment exerts a protective effect of the tissue for both drying methods. However, under complete dehydration (water activity, aw = 0.05) damage seems to be similar for both drying methods despite the PEF pretreatment. Remarkably, reversible electroporation followed by resting resulted in higher trichome preservation. At MR of 0.05, the area of trichomes on the surface of convective-dried, PEF-rested and fresh samples were not statistically different at 2267 ± 89 µm2 and 2218 ± 65 µm2, respectively, showing that this pretreatment still exerts a protective effect on trichomes when complete dehydration is achieved.<sep>Intron splicing is an essential event in post-transcriptional RNA processing in plant mitochondria, which requires the participation of diverse nuclear-encoded splicing factors. However, it is presently unclear how these proteins cooperatively take part in the splicing of specific introns. In this study, we characterized a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial P-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein named EMP603. This protein is essential for splicing of intron 2 in the Nad1 gene and interacts with the mitochondria-localized DEAD-box RNA helicase PMH2-5140, the RAD52-like proteins ODB1-0814 and ODB1-5061, and the CRM domain-containing protein Zm-mCSF1. Further study revealed that the N-terminal region of EMP603 interacts with the DEAD-box of PMH2-5140, the CRM domain of Zm-mCSF1, and OBD1-5061, but not with OBD1-0814, whereas the PPR domain of EMP603 can interact with ODB1-0814, ODB1-5061, and PMH2-5140, but not with Zm-mCSF1. Defects in EMP603 severely disrupt the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex I, leading to impaired mitochondrial function, and delayed seed development. The interactions revealed between EMP603 and PMH2-5140, ODB1-0814, ODB1-5061, and Zm-mCSF1 indicate a possible involvement of a dynamic 'spliceosome-like' complex in intron splicing, and may accelerate the elucidation of the intron splicing mechanism in plant mitochondria.<sep>Downy mildew disease, caused by the biotrophic oomycete Peronospora variabilis, is the largest threat to the cultivation of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) in the Andean highlands, and occurs worldwide. However, so far, no molecular study of the quinoa–Peronospora interaction has been reported. Here, we developed tools to study downy mildew disease in quinoa at the gene expression level. P. variabilis was isolated and maintained, allowing the study of downy mildew disease progression in two quinoa cultivars under controlled conditions. Quinoa gene expression changes induced by P. variabilis were analyzed by qRT-PCR, for quinoa homologues of A. thaliana pathogen-associated genes. Overall, we observed a slower disease progression and higher tolerance in the quinoa cultivar Kurmi than in the cultivar Maniqueña Real. The quinoa orthologs of putative defense genes such as the catalase CqCAT2 and the endochitinase CqEP3 showed no changes in gene expression. In contrast, quinoa orthologs of other defense response genes such as the transcription factor CqWRKY33 and the chaperone CqHSP90 were significantly induced in plants infected with P. variabilis. These genes could be used as defense response markers to select quinoa cultivars that are more tolerant to P. variabilis infection.<sep>Assembly of the functional complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain requires sophisticated and efficient regulatory mechanisms. In plants, the subunit composition and assembly factors involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) are substantially less defined than in mammals and yeast. In this study, we cloned maize (Zea mays) Small kernel 11 (Smk11) via map-based cloning. Smk11 encodes a mitochondria-localized tetratricopeptide repeat protein. Disruption of Smk11 severely affected the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex IV, leading to delayed plant growth and seed development. Protein interactions studies revealed that SMK11 might interact with four putative complex IV assembly factors, Inner membrane peptidase 1A (ZmIMP1A), MYB domain protein 3R3 (ZmMYB3R-3), cytochrome c oxidase 23 (ZmCOX23), and mitochondrial ferredoxin 1 (ZmMFDX1), among which ZmMFDX1 might interact with subunits ZmCOX6a and ZmCOX-X1; ZmMYB3R-3 might also interact with ZmCOX6a. The mutation of SMK11 perturbed the normal assembly of these subunits, leading to the inactivation of complex IV. The results of this study revealed that SMK11 serves as an accessory assembly factor required for the normal assembly of subunits into complex IV, which will accelerate the elucidation of the assembly of complex IV in plant mitochondria.<sep>Mitochondria function as hubs of plant metabolism. Oxidative phosphorylation produces ATP, but it is also a central high-capacity electron sink required by many metabolic pathways that must be flexibly coordinated and integrated. Here, we review the crucial roles of redox-associated posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs) in mitochondrial metabolic regulation. We discuss several major concepts. First, the major redox couples in the mitochondrial matrix (NAD, NADP, thioredoxin, glutathione, and ascorbate) are in kinetic steady state rather than thermodynamic equilibrium. Second, targeted proteomics have produced long lists of proteins potentially regulated by Cys oxidation/thioredoxin, Met-SO formation, phosphorylation, or Lys acetylation, but we currently only understand the functional importance of a few of these PTMs. Some site modifications may represent molecular noise caused by spurious reactions. Third, different PTMs on the same protein or on different proteins in the same metabolic pathway can interact to fine-tune metabolic regulation. Fourth, PTMs take part in the repair of stress-induced damage (e.g., by reducing Met and Cys oxidation products) as well as adjusting metabolic functions in response to environmental variation, such as changes in light irradiance or oxygen availability. Finally, PTMs form a multidimensional regulatory system that provides the speed and flexibility needed for mitochondrial coordination far beyond that provided by changes in nuclear gene expression alone.<sep>Abstract Symbiotic strains of fungi in the genus Trichoderma affect growth and pathogen resistance of many plant species, but the interaction is not known in molecular detail. Here we describe the transcriptomic response of two cultivars of the crop Chenopodium quinoa to axenic co-cultivation with Trichoderma harzianum BOL-12 and Trichoderma afroharzianum T22. The response of C. quinoa roots to BOL-12 and T22 in the early phases of interaction was studied by RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR verification. Interaction with the two fungal strains induced partially overlapping gene expression responses. Comparing the two plant genotypes, a broad spectrum of putative quinoa defense genes were found activated in the cultivar Kurmi but not in the Real cultivar. In cultivar Kurmi, relatively small effects were observed for classical pathogen response pathways but instead a C. quinoa -specific clade of germin-like genes were activated. Germin-like genes were found to be more rapidly induced in cultivar Kurmi as compared to Real. The same germin-like genes were found to also be upregulated systemically in the leaves. No strong correlation was observed between any of the known hormone-mediated defense response pathways and any of the quinoa- Trichoderma interactions. The differences in responses are relevant for the capabilities of applying Trichoderma agents for crop protection of different cultivars of C. quinoa .<sep>Abstract The downy mildew disease, caused by the biotrophic oomycete Peronospora variabilis , is the largest environmental threat to quinoa ( Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) cultivation in the Andean highlands. However, so far no molecular information on the quinoa- Peronospora interaction has been reported. Here, we have developed tools to study the downy mildew disease in quinoa at gene expression level. Living P. variabilis could be isolated and maintained in the presence of a fungicide, allowing the characterization of downy mildew disease progression in two differently susceptible quinoa cultivars under controlled conditions. Quinoa gene expression changes induced by P. variabilis were analysed by qRT-PCR for quinoa homologues of Arabidopsis thaliana pathogen-associated genes. Overall, we observed a slower disease progression and higher tolerance in the quinoa cultivar Kurmi than in the cultivar Maniquena Real. We also observed that quinoa orthologs of A. thaliana genes involved in the salicylic acid defense response pathway ( AtCAT2 and AtEP3 ) did not have changes in its gene expression. In contrast, quinoa orthologs of A. thaliana gene markers of the induction of the jasmonic acid response pathway ( AtWRKY33 and AtHSP90 ) were significantly induced in plants infected with P. variabilis . These genes could be used as defense response markers to select quinoa cultivars that are more tolerant to P. variabilis infection.<sep>Abstract Plants enhance their growth in the presence of particular soil bacteria due to volatile compounds affecting the homeostasis of plant growth hormones. However, the mechanisms of volatile compound signaling and plant perception has been unclear. This study identifies the bioactive volatile 3-octanone as a plant growth stimulating volatile, constitutively emitted by the soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor grown on a rich medium. When 3-octanone is applied to developing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, a family-wide induction of the Kelch-repeat F-box genes known as KISS ME DEADLY ( KMD ) subsequently alters auxin/cytokinin homeostasis to promote the growth of lateral roots and inhibit the primary root. Loss of function of the KMD family or other alterations of auxin/cytokinin homeostasis suppresses the volatile-induced growth response. This reveals a function of KMD s in the pathway of microbial volatile perception and plant growth responses. Significance Statement Volatiles from soil microbes are profound stimulators of plant growth. This work identifies for the first time a plant hormone signaling regulator, the gene family KISS ME DEADLY ( KMD ), to be an early essential step in plant growth promotion by a soil bacterial volatile, 3-octanone. The KMD -regulated gene network alters the tissue sensitivity balance for the growth hormones auxin and cytokinin, modifying root growth rate and architecture. Previously, the Kelch repeat F-box gene family of KMD s have been shown to be important down-regulators of both positive cytokinin signaling and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, but upstream cues were unknown. This report places the KMD family regulation of plant growth and defense into its biotic context.<sep>SUMMARY The study of plant mitochondria started in earnest around 1950 with the first isolations of mitochondria from animal and plant tissues. The first 35 years were spent establishing the basic properties of plant mitochondria and plant respiration using biochemical and physiological approaches. A number of unique properties (compared to mammalian mitochondria) were observed: (i) the ability to oxidize malate, glycine and cytosolic NAD(P)H at high rates; (ii) the partial insensitivity to rotenone, which turned out to be due to the presence of a second NADH dehydrogenase on the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane in addition to the classical Complex I NADH dehydrogenase; and (iii) the partial insensitivity to cyanide, which turned out to be due to an alternative oxidase, which is also located on the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, in addition to the classical Complex IV, cytochrome oxidase. With the appearance of molecular biology methods around 1985, followed by genomics, further unique properties were discovered: (iv) plant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is 10–600 times larger than the mammalian mtDNA, yet it only contains approximately 50% more genes; (v) plant mtDNA has kept the standard genetic code, and it has a low divergence rate with respect to point mutations, but a high recombinatorial activity; (vi) mitochondrial mRNA maturation includes a uniquely complex set of activities for processing, splicing and editing (at hundreds of sites); (vii) recombination in mtDNA creates novel reading frames that can produce male sterility; and (viii) plant mitochondria have a large proteome with 2000–3000 different proteins containing many unique proteins such as 200–300 pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. We describe the present and fairly detailed picture of the structure and function of plant mitochondria and how the unique properties make their metabolism more flexible allowing them to be involved in many diverse processes in the plant cell, such as photosynthesis, photorespiration, CAM and C4 metabolism, heat production, temperature control, stress resistance mechanisms, programmed cell death and genomic evolution. However, it is still a challenge to understand how the regulation of metabolism and mtDNA expression works at the cellular level and how retrograde signaling from the mitochondria coordinates all those processes.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/12796230", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5062313336", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5038837160", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates extensive experience in molecular biology, proteomics, and experimental genetics, with a strong focus on human diseases and clinical applications, aligning well with the project's requirements for malaria parasite research and molecular biology expertise.

Employing environmental justice as an analytical concept, we investigated how urban transformations have shaped Vienna’s UGS policies, it’s institutional setting as well as outcomes in terms of just provision. Vienna has maintained a high share of UGS – mostly large scale – including longstanding, uneven patterns. Recently, the City increased its efforts to implement more diverse UGS – small to micro scale – addressing multiple needs in light of the climate crisis.<sep>Abstract This article analyses the drivers and developments of the recent rise of a fictional region: Tabarnia in Spain. This platform proposes the creation of a new autonomous region to oppose the project of secession of the independentist Catalan movement. Given the dearth of academic research, our article documents and explores the case of Tabarnia. We draw on a multimethod approach, entailing a thematic analysis and process‐tracing, to reconstruct the trajectory of this platform and to uncover its drivers, goals and strategies. By building on this evidence base, this article construes Tabarnia as an instance of imaginary regionalism created ex nihilo in the noosphere. As such, Tabarnia represents an a‐topia substantiated through a digital region‐building process heavily relying on the use of humour.<sep>A wealth of literature acknowledges contemporary European cities’ enhanced political capacity. However, apart from a few exceptions, research on this topic tends to exclude time as an analytical dimension. Or, when the latter is considered, it covers a limited time span, rarely going beyond the post-Second World War period. This chapter contends that the recently revamped autonomy of European cities is the outcome of a century-long evolution. To this end, this chapter looks further back in time and historicises the development of European cities’ autonomy. An evolutionary institutionalist approach is employed to scrutinise the swinging European cities’ institutional and political capacity. Therefore, this chapter shows how the trajectory of European municipal autonomy went through periods of expansion and contraction, determined by their economic and political strengths.<sep>Since the late 1980s-early 1990s, when globalization reached its peak, much ink was poured to describe and examine this process and its effect on cities. While for some commentators, cities have been undergoing the inevitable homogenization of many aspects of the urban life, for others cities have been safeguarding their urban identity, that is, those unique features that make them different. By critically reviewing the debate between supporters and detractors of globalization, this article seeks to rehabilitate the distinctiveness of the urban dimension, which, as some theoretical approaches suggest, seems to be dissolved in the global world. By taking a sceptical stand against globalizers and glocalizers’ positions, this article rejects those arguments heralding the irrelevance, or even the death, of the local and underscores the cultural and political specificities of cities.<sep>In this introductory chapter we aim at providing the reader with the analytical tools to understand urban social policies. In particular, we address the territorial dimension of social policies and the role of cities as building blocks of social inclusion strategies. Our task is to disentangle the role and interplay between different jurisdictions, policy instruments, politics and contexts in the spatial construction of social policies and of their differences. Analytically, this entails addressing space an important dimension in this process, rather than considering it merely a container where social phenomena take place. This truism is at the very basis of the production of differentiated opportunity structures that contribute to territorialised patterns of social stratification, but also influence the way in which policies respond to shocks like the 2008 crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.<sep>European cities have built cooperative relations through transnational municipal networks (TMNs). Most of the dedicated literature has relied on the multi-level governance (MLG) framework, claiming that the establishment of TMNs has been favoured by the multi-tier and multi-actor system of governance developed within the European Union. While MLG can help to illustrate the characteristics and functions of TMNs, it does not enable to explain the engagement of European cities in these organisations. This article therefore identifies and discusses the analytical and operational limitations of the MLG approach. It is claimed that the MLG framework does not provide a suitable analytical approach to shed light on the economic, political and institutional drivers of the participation of European cities in TMNs. By way of contrast, an urban approach hinging on the urban level may address the MLG’s analytical and empirical shortcomings.<sep>Degrowth is establishing itself as a theory within the ecological and post-development scholarship. At the core of degrowth is a local-centric perspective, whereby small urban agglomerations are considered as the key actors of the political and economic system of an imagined post-consumerist and post-capitalist society. Degrowth proponents thus argue that the fundamental steps to achieve a truly democratic, socially just and ecological society should be taken at local level. However, in the degrowth theory a thorough debate about why the local level would be the most suitable spatial units to achieve degrowth is scarce. The importance of the small urban size appears to be axiomatic, rather than supported by substantive arguments. By engaging with non-mainstream strands of green political thought, this paper critically reflects upon the local-centred perspective at the core of the degrowth theory, identifying its main practical and theoretical shortcomings.<sep>The EC/EU has been an eminently nation-led project. However, running in parallel, the European municipalist movement, braiding relations among cities across Europe, has sought to build an influential political role for municipalities within the European polity. The study of European municipal cooperation has become a consolidated thread of research in European and Urban Studies. Nonetheless, contributions on the topic tend to focus on the pragmatic aspects of municipal collaborations, glossing over the ideological foundations of European Municipalism. Therefore, by challenging the dominant scholarly view, this article contends that European Municipalism may be considered as a ‘thin-centred’ ideology. To support this argument, the ideological structure of European Municipalism is unbundled by throwing light on its conceptual components. As a result, this article construes European Municipalism as a ‘thin-centred’ political ideology, which postulates universal city-to-city mutualism and proposes a European counter-project built on a polycentric and diffuse conception of power.<sep>Summary Local authorities have increasingly deployed instruments and practises proper of the international diplomatic repertoire—a phenomenon referred in the literature as paradiplomacy . These state-like diplomatic praxes, ranging from participating in transnational networks to signing international agreements, hint at an increased room for manoeuvre for local authorities, in that they occur without the intervention and control of the central state. While emulating states’ international behaviour, municipal paradiplomacy displays distinctive features and purposes. Drawing on the scholarship on paradiplomacy, this article provides a theoretical reflection on the teleology of municipal paradiplomatic practices. By proceeding through parallelism with state diplomacy’s objectives, this article identifies three functional equivalents that constitute the primary teloi of paradiplomacy; namely, municipal self-determination, influence and contention. By delving into the aims of municipal paradiplomacy, the article points out how municipal paradiplomacy constitutes a valuable means for municipalities to progressively free themselves from the grip of the central state.<sep>The EC/EU has been an eminently nation-led project. However, running in parallel, the European municipalist movement, weaving relations among cities across Europe, has sought to carve out an influential political role for municipalities within the European polity. The study of European municipal cooperation has become a consolidated thread of research in European and urban studies. Nonetheless, contributions on the topic tend to focus on the pragmatic aspects of municipal collaborations, glossing over the ideological foundations of European municipalism. Therefore, by challenging the dominant scholarly view, this chapter contends that European municipalism may be considered as a ‘thin-centred’ ideology. Drawing on Freeden’s (1996, 1998, 2017) work, the ideological structure of European municipalism is unbundled by throwing light on its conceptual components. As a result, this chapter construes European municipalism as a fully-fledged political ideology, which postulates universal city-to-city mutualism and proposes a European counter-project built on a polycentric and diffuse conception of power.<sep>Abstract Air pollution is one of the primary concerns of our society for its effect on human health and the environment. Among the policy measures that can be put in place to limit air pollutant emissions, end-of-pipe technologies and/or regulatory instruments may be implemented through legislative acts. Also, equally important are behavioural measures, requiring citizens’ active involvement. The success of any measure to limit pollutant emissions requires the acceptance by the citizens that, in turn, implies a correct perception of the main pollutant emission drivers. We present here the comparison between the public perception of air pollution sources and the real-world situation through a survey carried out in seven European countries and involving 16 101 respondents. Our study shows a dramatic underestimation of the contribution of the agri-food sector to air pollution. This result is common to all respondents in the seven countries examined and only to a small extent depends on gender, age and socio-economic status of the respondents.<sep>Since the late 1980s–early 1990s, when globalisation reached its peak, much ink was poured to describe and examine this process and its effect on cities. While, for some commentators, cities have been undergoing the inevitable homogenisation of many aspects of the urban life, for others, cities have been safeguarding their urban identity, that is, those unique features that make them different. By critically reviewing the debate between supporters and detractors of globalisation, this chapter seeks to rehabilitate the distinctiveness of the urban dimension, which, as some theoretical approaches suggest, seems to be dissolved in the global world. By taking a sceptical stand against globalisers and glocalisers’ positions, this chapter rejects those arguments heralding the irrelevance, or even the death, of the local and underscores the cultural and political specificities of cities. Underpinning this argument is the conceptualisation of local autonomy in its identitarian form. In such a view, urban identity becomes an instance of local autonomy, seen as the freedom of cities to define their own selves.<sep>Over the last few years Europe has faced the phenomenon of ‘forced migrations’, which has led to the establishment of reception systems and the implementation of integration policies to host asylum seekers and refugees. In particular, local authorities have sought to address the challenges posed by integration by putting in place innovative measures. By employing the concept of social innovation, this article provides a glimpse of the variety of integration measures developed at the local level. Focusing on labour market inclusion, this article compares socially innovative practices implemented in two European cities: Bologna and Vienna. The article draws on a document analysis, interviews with local officials and NGO practitioners and workshops to examine the institutional, political and social factors that have shaped the implementation of local social innovation to ease the access of refugees and asylum seekers to the labour market. The findings reveal that the scope and incisiveness of the institutional action, the local political culture and the mobilising capacity of civil society influence the development of local socially innovative practices.<sep>Austria's exclusive model of citizenship, and restrictive policies on migration, refugee reception and asylum, dating back to the 1990s, create structural barriers to refugee integration in the country’s economic and socio-cultural life. In this article, we shed light on Vienna, a city renowned for its comprehensive social policies. However, the inclusive integration approach adopted by the city clashes with the stricter national migration and asylum policies. By relying on actor-centred institutionalism, we trace the interdependencies of various policy fields shaping refugees’ integration pathways after their arrival. From a methodological perspective, we draw upon document analysis and semi-structured interviews with policymakers and NGO workers. The findings show that refugees' and asylum seekers’ integration within Vienna depends on multiple actors with partially overlapping responsibilities, which creates a strong network of (institutional) opportunity structures. This multi-level system may benefit from the expertise of, and strong relations between the actors involved. However, its weakness lies in its dependency on funding and the limited participation opportunities for civil society. In this paper, we emphasize the high degree of institutionalization in the Viennese integration policy regime, which is equipped to modify provision to address current needs, while civil society actors remain underrepresented in the policy-making process.<sep>The urban dimension has held a vivid attraction to social researchers. Since the contributions of early urban sociologists, the urban scale has provided a bound environment where human behaviours can be best observed. However, the political potential of cities has been sidestepped. Therefore, this chapter contends that political action is intrinsically connected to the specific features of the urban dimension. The city is here construed as the site and catalyser of political activation, inasmuch as urban characteristics prompt the body of residents to engage in political acts. For this, cities constitute the humus for the civitas activa. To articulate the political potential of cities, this chapter bridges multiple scholarly contributions across political theory, political science and critical urban studies. By bringing into conversation different theoretical imports, a distinction between the political as dissensus and as deliberation is provided, to underscore how cities are conducive of conflict and dialogue at the same time. In particular, greater attention is drawn to the political as deliberation to conceptualise the urban as a favourable locus for political action. By examining the nature of the political and its connection with the urban, this chapter thus seeks to reinstate the political value of cities, countering post-political urban visions.<sep>Education can provide individuals access to work and career possibilities. It may also contribute to greater societal equality, facilitating social mobility. The transition from secondary school (SEC) to higher education (HE) (and beyond) is particularly important, impacting both on individuals’ lives and on society more widely (e.g., by supplying labor markets with required qualifications). Taking an interdisciplinary, cross-national perspective, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 young people from Germany, Argentina, and Chile, aiming to enhance understanding of individuals’ perceptions of barriers and facilitators of transitioning from SEC to HE, in the context of their personal/family situations, social structures and cultural environments. Thematic data analysis pointed to commonality in terms of what young people from the three countries consider as facilitators (e.g., personal ambition; support from family/friends) and barriers (e.g., high expectations of oneself/family/friends; lack of interest in study subject). Unsurprisingly, given the three countries’ distinct educational systems, societal structures, cultural values etc., the findings also revealed some differences across the three cases, such as role models acting as an important facilitator much more in Germany compared to Chile and Argentina. We conclude that many contextual and personal factors can both facilitate and hinder young people from accessing to and thriving in HE, most of which are relevant to individuals regardless of their country of origin. Further research could expand our qualitative study, for instance, through a large-scale, quantitative study across a wider range of countries.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>State capitalism<sep>Capital market<sep>Productivity<sep>Government (linguistics)<sep>State (computer science)<sep>Private sector<sep>Politics<sep>Capitalism<sep>Financial crisis<sep>Islam<sep>Public sector<sep>Diversification (marketing strategy)<sep>Boom<sep>Real estate<sep>Waqf<sep>Appropriation<sep>Sharia<sep>Market liquidity<sep>Subsidy<sep>Legislature<sep>Authoritarianism</keyword><title>The Impact of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 on the Bahrain Economy<sep>Land, Waqf, Ma’tam, and the Moral Economy<sep>Labour Regimes, Mobility, Productivity, and Migrant National Workers<sep>A Place for the State<sep>Islam and Capitalism in the Making of Modern Bahrain</title><abstract>Abstract Bahrain did not escape the impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis entirely. However, the oil price boom of Bahrain’s GCC neighbours and major capital inflows had, from the 1990s, fuelled credit growth, inflation, and a rise in real estate and harbour construction. The corporate sector had ridden the boom in credit, although with increased vulnerabilities. Bahrain’s banks retained profits and were a major source of liquidity for the stock market during the crisis. Bahrain’s regulatory regime addressed the role of intermediaries in business, structuring securities transactions and managing non-state participants and participants from secondary markets.<sep>Abstract The economic evolution of the waqf, which was institutionalized in law and land, assisted the renaissance of Islamic finance and the creation of Bahrain as the financial hub of the Gulf states. In the contemporary Middle East, Islamic philanthropy has become a vital tool in state control, as in Syria. Fyzee Asaf considered the waqf to be a form of internal colonizing of Mohammedan law, a religious contract that was fundamental for an Islamic moral economy. In Bahrain, the waqf and ma’tam have, to a degree, protected land from appropriation by the state by placing it within the Shari’ah legal code.<sep>Abstract At the initiative of the state, Bahrain’s labour structure and recruitment have changed considerably in recent decades. These initiatives included shifting from oil into diversified industries from the late 1990s. Recognizing the importance of clusters in oil processing through BAPCO and aluminium production through ALBA, the government sought to regulate the employment of expatriates while educating locals for the telecommunications, electronics, and technology industries. There was some hoarding of cheap foreign workers within the private sector, and this proved to be an important cause of poor labour productivity in the 1990s. The public sector performed even more poorly than the private sector. Subsidies in the public sector to maintain wages led locals to remain in inefficient posts and resist opportunities to acquire skills and move into more competitive sectors.<sep>Abstract In its pre-colonial and colonial history, legal concepts and practices in Bahrain shaped the transformation of the economy and the state. The grip of the state was tempered by law. And in recent decades, there has been an urgent need to liberate the economy and business through the evolution of a legislative framework. The power of the Bahrain state grew with the power of oil, principally after 1971. High oil prices, particularly after 2004–09, have coincided with a further change in the role of the state, economic diversification, and the reform of labour markets, reducing dependence on foreign labour and emphasizing local labour and its acquisition of essential skills. It is often said that Bahrain’s authoritarian state survives through oil wealth and the co-option of business elites. But Bahrain is unique in the Middle East, in that the state is responsive to secular institutions and political pressures through the law. There is juridical space for the state.<sep>Abstract In recent decades, the culture, society, politics, and economics, indeed the national identities, of Bahrain have been transformed, driving its global ambitions while retaining, to a degree, the rule of law and cosmopolitanism. Bahrain has sought to liberate the economy and business through the evolution of a legislative framework, although one often manipulated by the monarchy. At the same time, the Islamic charities in Bahrain, have provided a degree of autonomy and legal clarity for the Shi’ite majority in what is a Sunni-dominated state. Their powerful presence has moderated commercial capitalism and aggressive nationalism. Moreover, Bahrain has achieved a remarkable transformation towards market-led capitalism, seen most notably in its emergence as a major centre of Islamic finance and in the creation of substantial industrial diversification. As a result, Bahrain has become integral to the success of the Gulf Cooperation Council, attracting the vast oil wealth of its Gulf neighbours. It has frequently been argued that oil resources have been a curse for those who possess them. That has not been the case with Bahrain, but it has brought fractures to the society and to its politics. Notable here is the large presence of foreign labour, particularly in the private sector, which has impeded the development of essential skills and the improvement of labour productivity for indigenous labour. The education and skills gap between foreign and local labour is arguably more divisive for modern Bahrain than the religious divisions between the Sunni state and its Shi’a majority.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/58242/research-assistant-international-business-and-economics/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5052039104", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5050906944", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description through their extensive research on urban governance, public services, and multi-level governance, which are directly relevant to PSIRU's focus on public services and privatisation.

Generalizing the untwisted case, the present approach is based on a spectral correspondence for meromorphic Higgs bundles with fixed conjugacy classes at the marked points. This construction is carried out for twisted wild character varieties associated to [Formula: see text] torus knots, providing a colored generalization of existing results of Hausel, Mereb and Wong as well as Shende, Treumann and Zaslow.<sep>In previous work we showed that the Hurwitz space of W(E_6)-covers of the projective line branched over 24 points dominates via the Prym-Tyurin map the moduli space A_6 of principally polarized abelian 6-folds.

We do this here for several Calabi-Yau's obtained in [DW09] as crepant resolutions of the orbifold quotient of the product of three elliptic curves. In particular we verify in these cases a recent claim of [GHKSST16] by noting that a power of the Hodge line bundle is trivial -- even though in most of these cases the Picard group is infinite.<sep>The Bagger–Witten line bundle is a line bundle over moduli spaces of two-dimensional SCFTs, related to the Hodge line bundle of holomorphic top-forms on Calabi–Yau manifolds. It has recently been a subject of a number of conjectures, but concrete examples have proven elusive. In this paper we propose a new, intrinsically geometric definition of the Bagger–Witten line bundle, whose restriction to the moduli spaces of complex structures of Calabi–Yau manifolds we explicitly compute in some concrete examples. We also conjecture a new criterion for UV completion of four-dimensional supergravity theories in terms of properties of the Bagger–Witten line bundle.<sep>The bad locus in the moduli of super Riemann surfaces with Ramond punctures parametrizes those super Riemann surfaces that have more than the expected number of independent closed holomorphic 1-forms. There is a super period map that depends on certain discrete choices. For each such choice, the period map blows up along a divisor that contains the bad locus. Our main result is that away from the bad locus, at least one of these period maps remains finite. In other words, we identify the bad locus as the intersection of the blowup divisors. The proof abstracts the situation into a question in linear algebra, which we then solve. We also give some bounds on the dimension of the bad locus.<sep>The bad locus in the moduli of super Riemann surfaces with Ramond punctures parametrizes those super Riemann surfaces that have more than the expected number of independent closed holomorphic 1-forms.

This folding procedure allows to trace back the properties of the corresponding simple Lie algebras or groups to those of $\\textrm{ADE}$-type. In this article, we implement the techniques of folding by graph automorphisms for Hitchin integrable systems. We show that the fixed point loci of these automorphisms are isomorphic as algebraic integrable systems to the Hitchin systems of the folded groups away from singular fibers. The latter Hitchin systems are isomorphic to the intermediate Jacobian fibrations of Calabi–Yau orbifold stacks constructed by the 1st author. We construct simultaneous crepant resolutions of the associated singular quasi-projective Calabi–Yau three-folds and compare the resulting intermediate Jacobian fibrations to the corresponding Hitchin systems.<sep>Much of the analysis of F-theory-based Standard Models boils down to computing cohomologies of line bundles on matter curves. By varying parameters one can degenerate such matter curves to singular ones, typically with many nodes, where the computation is combinatorial and straightforward. The question remains to relate the (a priori possibly smaller) value on the original curve to the singular one. In this work, we introduce some elementary techniques (pruning trees and removing interior edges) for simplifying the resulting nodal curves to a small collection of terminal ones that can be handled directly. When applied to the QSMs, these techniques yield optimal results in the sense that obtaining more precise answers would require currently unavailable information about the QSM geometries. This provides us with an opportunity to enhance the statistical bounds established in earlier research regarding the absence of vector-like exotics on the quark-doublet curve.<sep>Motivated by the connection to 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, we study the global behavior of families of tamely-ramified $SL_N$ Hitchin integrable systems as the underlying curve varies over the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable pointed curves. In particular, we describe a flat degeneration of the Hitchin system to a nodal base curve and show that the behaviour of the integrable system at the node is partially encoded in a pair $(O,H)$ where $O$ is a nilpotent orbit and $H$ is a simple Lie subgroup of $F_{O}$, the flavour symmetry group associated to $O$. The family of Hitchin systems is nontrivially-fibered over the Deligne-Mumford moduli space. We prove a non-obvious result that the Hitchin bases fit together to form a vector bundle over the compactified moduli space. For the particular case of $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{0,4}$, we compute this vector bundle explicitly. Finally, we give a classification of the allowed pairs $(O,H)$ that can arise for any given $N$.<sep>Motivated by the connection to 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, we study the global behavior of families of tamely-ramified $SL_N$ Hitchin integrable systems as the underlying curve varies over the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable pointed curves.

We describe two important features which distinguish it from the type A case studied in arXiv:2008.01020. The first feature, which we term even type constraints, arise iff the partition label $[\\mathcal{O}_H]$ has even parts. In this case, our Hitchin image is non-singular and thus different from the one studied by Baraglia and Kamgarpour. We argue that our Hitchin image always globalizes to being the Hitchin base of an integrable system. The second feature, which we term odd type constraints, is related to a particular finite group $\\overline{A}_b(\\mathcal{O}_H)$ being non-trivial. When this finite group is non-trivial, we have $\\mid \\overline{A}_b \\mid$ choices for the local Hitchin base. Additionally, we also show that the finite group $\\overline{A}_b(\\mathcal{O}_H)$ encodes the size of the dual special piece.<sep>Motivated by engineering vector-like (Higgs) pairs in the spectrum of 4d F-theory compactifications, we combine machine learning and algebraic geometry techniques to analyze line bundle cohomologies on families of holomorphic curves. To quantify jumps of these cohomologies, we first generate 1.8 million pairs of line bundles and curves embedded in $dP_3$, for which we compute the cohomologies. A white-box machine learning approach trained on this data provides intuition for jumps due to curve splittings, which we use to construct additional vector-like Higgs-pairs in an F-Theory toy model. We also find that, in order to explain quantitatively the full dataset, further tools from algebraic geometry, in particular Brill--Noether theory, are required. Using these ingredients, we introduce a diagrammatic way to express cohomology jumps across the parameter space of each family of matter curves, which reflects a stratification of the F-theory complex structure moduli space in terms of the vector-like spectrum. Furthermore, these insights provide an algorithmically efficient way to estimate the possible cohomology dimensions across the entire parameter space.<sep>While M- and F-theory compactifications describe a much larger class of vacua than perturbative string compactifications, they typically need singularities to generate non-abelian gauge fields and charged matter. The physical explanation involves M2-branes wrapped on vanishing cycles. Here we seek an alternative explanation that could address outstanding issues such as the description of nilpotent branches, stability walls, frozen singularities and so forth. To this end we use a model in which the three-form is related to the Chern-Simons form of a bundle. The model has a one-form non-abelian gauge symmetry which normally eliminates all the degrees of freedom associated to the bundle. However by restricting the transformations to preserve the bundle along the vanishing cycles, we may get new degrees of freedom associated to singularities, without appealing to wrapped M2-branes. The analysis can be simplified by gauge-fixing the one-form symmetry using higher-dimensional instanton equations. We explain how this mechanism leads to the natural emergence of phenomena such as enhanced ADE gauge symmetries, nilpotent branches, charged matter fields and their holomorphic couplings.<sep>Motivated by the appearance of fractional powers of line bundles in studies of vector-like spectra in 4d F-theory compactifications, we analyze the structure and origin of these bundles. Fractional powers of line bundles are also known as root bundles and can be thought of as generalizations of spin bundles. We explain how these root bundles are linked to inequivalent F-theory gauge potentials of a $G_4$-flux. While this observation is interesting in its own right, it is particularly valuable for F-theory Standard Model constructions. In aiming for MSSMs, it is desired to argue for the absence of vector-like exotics. We work out the root bundle constraints on all matter curves in the largest class of currently-known F-theory Standard Model constructions without chiral exotics and gauge coupling unification. On each matter curve, we conduct a systematic \"bottom\"-analysis of all solutions to the root bundle constraints and all spin bundles. Thereby, we derive a lower bound for the number of combinations of root bundles and spin bundles whose cohomologies satisfy the physical demand of absence of vector-like pairs. On a technical level, this systematic study is achieved by a well-known diagrammatic description of root bundles on nodal curves. We extend this description by a counting procedure, which determines the cohomologies of so-called limit root bundles on full blow-ups of nodal curves. By use of deformation theory, these results constrain the vector-like spectra on the smooth matter curves in the actual F-theory geometry.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Lattice (music)<sep>Crystal (programming language)<sep>Lattice energy<sep>Atom (system on chip)<sep>Sequence (biology)<sep>Periodic sequence<sep>Ideal (ethics)<sep>Point (geometry)<sep>Symmetry (geometry)<sep>Position (finance)<sep>Diffraction<sep>Motion (physics)<sep>Axiom<sep>Isometry (Riemannian geometry)<sep>Set (abstract data type)<sep>Voronoi diagram<sep>Crystal structure<sep>Class (philosophy)<sep>Similarity (geometry)<sep>Periodic table<sep>Periodic function</keyword><title>The asymptotic behaviour and a near linear time algorithm for isometry invariants of periodic sets<sep>Voronoi‐Based Similarity Distances between Arbitrary Crystal Lattices<sep>Voronoi-based similarity distances between arbitrary crystal lattices<sep>Average Minimum Distances continuously quantify similarities between geometries of any crystal structures<sep>Fast predictions of lattice energies by continuous isometry invariants\n  of crystal structures<sep>Fast Predictions of Lattice Energies by Continuous Isometry Invariants of Crystal Structures<sep>Average minimum distances of periodic point sets – foundational invariants for mapping periodic crystals<sep>Average Minimum Distances of periodic point sets</title><abstract>The fundamental model of a periodic structure is a periodic point set up to rigid motion or isometry.

Quantifying a similarity between crystal structures is needed to substantially speed up the crystal structure prediction, because the prediction of many target properties of crystal structures is computationally slow and is essentially repeated for many nearly identical simulated structures. The proposed distances between arbitrary periodic lattices of crystal structures are invariant under all rigid motions, satisfy the metric axioms and continuity under atomic perturbations. The above properties make these distances ideal tools for clustering and visualizing large datasets of crystal structures. All the conclusions are rigorously proved and justified by experiments on real and simulated crystal structures.<sep>This paper develops a new continuous approach to a similarity between periodic lattices of ideal crystals.

This embarrassment of over-prediction can be resolved only if crystals are compared for similarity by invariants that are independent of crystal representations and preserved by rigid motions. To continuously quantify a similarity between crystals with the same chemical composition, these invariants should be also stable under atomic vibrations, while discrete invariants such as symmetry groups discontinuously change under perturbations. We define the infinite sequence of Average Minimum Distances (AMDs) that satisfy the above conditions and can distinguish homometric crystals, hence are stronger than powder diffraction patterns. The AMDs can visualize geometric similarities between any periodic patterns or crystals. The classification power of AMDs is validated on the dataset of almost 6K simulated T2 crystals reported in Nature 543 (2017), 657-664.<sep>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) aims to discover solid crystalline materials by optimizing periodic arrangements of atoms, ions or molecules. CSP takes weeks of supercomputer time because of slow energy minimizations for millions of simulated crystals. The lattice energy is a key physical property, which determines thermodynamic stability of a crystal but has no simple analytic expression. Past machine learning approaches to predict the lattice energy used slow crystal descriptors depending on manually chosen parameters. The new area of Periodic Geometry offers much faster isometry invariants that are also continuous under perturbations of atoms. Our experiments on simulated crystals confirm that a small distance between the new invariants guarantees a small difference of energies. We compare several kernel methods for invariant-based predictions of energy and achieve the mean absolute error of less than 5kJ/mole or 0.05eV/atom on a dataset of 5679 crystals.<sep>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) aims to discover solid crystalline materials by optimizing periodic arrangements of atoms, ions or molecules.

The strongest natural equivalence of crystals is rigid motion or isometry that preserves all inter-atomic distances. Past comparisons of periodic structures often used manual thresholds, symmetry groups and reduced cells, which are discontinuous under perturbations or thermal vibrations of atoms. This work defines the infinite sequence of continuous isometry invariants (Average Minimum Distances) to progressively capture distances between neighbors. The asymptotic behaviour of the new invariants is theoretically proved in all dimensions for a wide class of sets including non-periodic. The proposed near linear time algorithm identified all different crystals in the world's largest Cambridge Structural Database within a few hours on a modest desktop. The ultra fast speed and proved continuity provide rigorous foundations to continuously parameterise the space of all periodic crystals as a high-dimensional extension of Mendeleev's table of elements.<sep>Periodic sets of points model all solid crystalline materials (crystals) by representing atoms as labeled points. Crystal structures are determined in a rigid form and are considered up to rigid motions or isometries. Modern tools of Crystal Structure Prediction output thousands of simulated structures, though only few of them can be really synthesized. The first obstacle is the presence of many near duplicate structures that can not be efficiently recognized on the fly by past tools. To continuously quantify a similarity between periodic sets, their isometry invariants should be continuous under perturbations when all discrete invariants such as symmetry groups can break down. This paper studies the isometry classification problem for periodic sets with the new continuity requirement and introduces the Average Minimum Distances, which form an infinite sequence of continuous isometry invariants. Their asymptotic behaviour for a wide class of sets is explicitly described in terms of a point packing coefficient.

This paper aims to investigate coupling beams using HSS diagonal bars and HSS transverse reinforcement. Four coupling beam specimens with a clear span-to-depth ratio of 2.0 were built with varying concrete materials and confinement details and tested under quasi-static reversed-cyclic shear loading. Despite using the maximum transverse reinforcement spacing that is allowed in ACI 318–19, all coupling beam specimens exhibited satisfactory seismic performance in terms of adequate deformation capacity and stable hysteretic response. Favorable performance, characterized by a greater damage control ability, larger shear strength, and deformation capacity, was achieved in specimens using high-strength concrete, especially fiber-reinforced high-strength concrete. The coupling beam specimen with confinement provided for the entire beam cross section outperformed the specimen with confinement provided for the individual diagonals. The state-of-practice design methods for coupling beams are evaluated with experimental results.<sep>This paper presents steady-state dynamic response analysis of recently developed two types of self-centering structural systems with viscous damping. One of them has nonlinear elastic behavior in the primary structures, and the seismic energy is dissipated by added viscous damping. The other system has elasto-plastic hysteretic behavior in the primary structures, and the seismic energy is dissipated by both yielding of primary structure and added viscous damping. While the developed self-centering structural systems have advantages in reducing residual displacement and acceleration, it is anticipated that such self-centering systems may have large displacement demand due to the potentially limited energy dissipation. The results obtained in this paper show that the supplemental viscous damping of 10% and 20% is required to effectively control the displacement demand for self-centering systems whose primary structural system is nonlinear elastic and elasto-plastic behaviors, respectively. The effects of various parameters of the hysteretic response on the system's seismic peak displacement demand were also investigated.<sep>This paper investigated a novel hybrid precast pier system that utilized ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC). The pier combines features of emulative and nonemulative (of cast-in-place construction) systems to balance self-centering and energy dissipation under seismic loading and uses UHPC to maintain that balance with low damage. An analytical model was used to study piers with varying UHPC mixes, properties of which were determined through material testing. Two large-scale pier specimens with UHPC and with varying confinement reinforcement grades were tested under quasi-static cyclic lateral loading. The test results demonstrated that the selected UHPC mix enabled the balance between bending and rocking. The rocking-induced cracking was not prevented by UHPC but was alleviated with a steel case. When the rocking-induced damage was prevented, more than 40% of the total displacement was caused by rocking at smaller drift ratios (<0.5%), enabling self-centering. At larger drift ratios (>4.5%), approximately 80% of the displacement was from bending, enabling energy dissipation. Replacing normal-strength steel with high-strength steel confinement did not improve the flexural capacity or ductility of UHPC.<sep>Ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) has the potential to address seismic performance issues reported for rectangular hollow columns. However, an impediment to the use of UHPC is its limited flexural ductility compared with normal concrete (NC) with the same confinement. This study investigated UHPC rectangular, hollow cross-section bridge columns with HSS as a confinement alternative using flexure (moment-curvature), flexure-shear and finite-element analyses. The flexural analytical model, validated by tests in the literature, was used to perform parametric studies to assess the impact of HSS on column flexural ductility. Analysis results showed that HSS confinement can improve the flexural ductility of UHPC, making UHPC suitable for hollow columns. The flexure-shear interaction model considered the shear strength degradation with increasing displacements to estimate the failure mode. UHPC columns outperformed NC columns in delaying shear-controlled failure. Finite-element analysis was performed on columns with selected design parameters to understand the impact of UHPC on shear damage control. The ratio of flexure to shear displacements was higher in UHPC columns compared with NC columns due to UHPC’s higher shear resistance.<sep>This paper introduces a tessellated structural-architectural (TeSA) wall system concept with the potential for improving both resilience and sustainability of the built environment. Resilience requires fast recovery and restoration of building functionality after an extreme event, while sustainability seeks designs that facilitate building adaptability and reuse for long-term occupancy. TeSA wall systems are comprised of individual, interchangeable tile segments, which are arranged in tessellated (repetitive) patterns. TeSA walls provide a resilient and sustainable solution wherein tiles can be prefabricated, reconfigured, disassembled, and reused during the lifetime of a structure. This paper introduces the TeSA concept through preliminary physical and analytical studies. The physical test involved a beam made of interlocking tessellated acrylic tiles, which was loaded to failure. The analytical study featured two reinforced concrete TeSA shear walls under lateral loading. The physical test showed that damage can be localized within individual tiles that can be replaced to restore loadbearing capacity. The analyses showed that TeSA shear walls can provide ductility and localized damage in individual tiles. Recommendations for advancing the TeSA toward implementation are also discussed.<sep>Seismic fragility assessment using structural dynamic analysis remains challenging for complex systems due to the high computational demand, such as the sea-crossing cable-stayed bridges. The paper aims to overcome this difficulty by developing an efficient seismic fragility analysis framework based on endurance time method (ETM). To demonstrate the framework for developing fragility curves, an example sea-crossing cable-stayed bridge is used as a case study. The ETM framework is validated by comparing the calculated fragility curves with those calculated by IDA framework. It is shown that the ETM is capable of significantly reducing computational effort without compromising the accuracy of fragility analysis results. The validated framework is then used to discuss the seismic fragility of sea-crossing cable-stayed bridges under scour and earthquakes. The influence of the time duration of endurance time acceleration functions (ETAFs) on the structural fragility is discussed. The influence of the time duration of ETAFs on the component fragility varies across different components, but the system fragility increases with the increasing time duration on the whole. Scour can produce either beneficial or adverse effects on the component and system seismic fragilities depending on the scour depth.<sep>The grouted sleeve connection has been demonstrated to be robust enough to maintain its integrity under earthquake loads. However, no research to date has examined the connection behaviour under direct shear, resulting in a high risk of failure of the pier subject to a vehicle collision. In this regard, this research first carried out static and impact loading tests on grouted sleeve specimens to characterize their direct shear damage mechanisms. Next, a simplified finite element (FE) modelling method was proposed to simulate connection behaviour, and its accuracy was verified using the test results. Based on the proposed connection modelling approach, truck-bridge collision analysis was performed on a prototype highway bridge that uses grouted sleeves in the pier. From the analysis results, increasing the number of column segments can lead to higher stiffness of the pier when resisting the vehicular impact. The friction property at the connection interface plays an essential role in avoiding unacceptably large rebar shear stress due to excessive sliding and developing the diagonal compression strut to resist the impact load. Finally, feasible retrofit techniques were explored for the precast concrete piers that showed inadequate impact resistance.<sep>Climate change is expected to alter the environmental factors that are known to influence the corrosion process, creating additional uncertainties in the long-term performance of reinforced concrete (RC) decks. With due consideration of site-specific exposure and environmental conditions, this study aims to investigate the degree to which projected climate change may impact corrosion-induced damage for RC bridges. A hierarchical two-tier framework was developed incorporating the material deterioration process simulation at the local element level, and a component level prediction of the corrosion-induced damage severity and extent over the bridge deck domain. The predictive accuracy of this framework was validated against the historical bridge inspection data. Case studies were performed for decks located in Toronto and Victoria to investigate the influence of climate data resolution and climate projection models on deck deterioration status. At last, ANN (artificial neural network) and SVM (support vector machine) approaches were used to generate a series of cartographic expressions to reveal how the corrosion-induced deck deterioration risk varies with the region due to the difference in the environmental conditions. These maps can serve as visual tools to express the corrosion damage risks for different bridge locations and to formulate region-based durability design requirements.<sep>Current prescriptive design provisions adopt a constant impact design load to address vehicular collisions to bridge piers. This practice can account for neither the vehicle characteristics nor the pier’s structural properties, which may render the existing highway bridges vulnerable to accidental heavy vehicle collisions. To address this limitation, the first objective of this article is to develop a predictive model to efficiently link the impact design load with influential structural and vehicular parameters. An essential step to achieve this objective is to use validated finite element modelling approaches to obtain the impact force-time history response for vehicle-bridge collision events with varying structural and vehicular characteristics. Statistical techniques are employed for optimal model determination. As an alternative to the prescriptive design, the performance-based approach features the ability to explicitly define structural collision safety and deliver efficient design solutions. Two complementary performance metrics (percentage loss of axial capacity and the ratio of the maximum relative displacement at the impact location to the pier height) are proposed to characterize collision-induced damage in an objective manner. The integration of these two metrics into collision performance assessment makes it possible to quantify the capacity of a bridge to resume its normal operation<sep>This research explores the seismic performance of multi-segment columns, which are gaining attention due to their segmented prefabrication and assembly that address transportation and installation challenges. The main objective is to investigate the effective use of grouted sleeves as connections, both between column segments and to the foundation, in order to achieve satisfactory seismic behavior. To achieve this objective, an experimental program involving reversed cyclic tests was conducted on three precast specimens, which were compared to a reference conventional cast-in-place (CIP) column. The precast specimens featured grouted sleeve connections, with variations in the number of column segments and the connection types. The test results showed higher peak strength but reduced ductility in the grouted sleeve specimens compared to the CIP column. Moreover, multi-segment columns displayed significant improvements in ductility (12.8%), deformation capacity (27.0%), and energy dissipation (14.8%) compared to the single-segment column. Transferring grouted sleeves to the foundation further improved ductility by 18.0%. In parallel, a finite element (FE) modeling method was developed, with simplified representations of cushions and grouted sleeves. The FE results exhibited satisfactory agreement with the experimental findings, validating the accuracy of the developed FE models in terms of hysteresis curves, residual displacement, peak<sep>Segmental posttensioned precast concrete (SPPC) is a promising approach to accelerated bridge construction (ABC). However, an impediment to the performance-based design of SPPC piers lies in the challenge of defining appropriate damage states and corresponding engineering demand parameter (EDP) limits. To address this, in this study, genetic programming (GP), a form of artificial intelligence, is used to develop drift ratio–based EDP limit models in order to identify the onset of four damage levels that are particularly introduced herein for SPPC piers. In this respect, a finite-element model using ABAQUS is developed and experimentally validated to simulate the response of SPPC piers under seismic loading. The model is then utilized to generate a data set of 316 cases, all within the feasible design space of SPPC piers. This data set is subsequently used to develop GP-based predictive equations that map the relationship between different SPPC pier design parameters (e.g., posttensioning strand ratio, concrete compressive strength, and gravity load level) and EDP (i.e., drift ratio) limits. The performance of the developed equations is evaluated through different measures, including fitness function and performance index. Ultimately, parametric and sensitivity analyses are conducted to demonstrate that the GP-based equations are robust enough<sep>Traffic disruptions and downtime due to bridge repair or replacement can cause significant socioeconomic losses. ‘Accelerated Bridge Construction’ (ABC) can minimize the impact of bridge construction on roadside safety by reducing the duration of on-site projects. Precast concrete bridge elements and systems have been recognized as key technology of ABC. However, they are significantly under-utilized in seismicity areas for bridge substructures. This is because the seismic design guidelines for using precast concrete have not been fully developed. The lack of code provisions stems from the challenge in the definition of appropriate damage states in relation to the functionality of the bridge. To address this challenge, the objective of this paper is to understand the damage modes of segmental post-tensioned precast concrete bridge pier under earthquake loading. In this respect, a nonlinear finite element approach is used to analyze the lateral load behaviour of precast concrete piers. Previous laboratory test results are collected to cover different design scenarios. The accuracy of the developed finite element model is experimentally validated by comparing the calculated and measured response in terms of a variety of seismic performance metrics, including lateral stiffness/strength and the variation of post-tension force versus lateral displacements. The<sep>Segmental post-tensioned precast concrete (SPPC), an important technique of Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC), has been proven its advantages over monolithic cast-in-place concrete in rapid bridge rehabilitation and construction. To deploy its implementation in bridge substructures for seismic applications, proposing performance-based design specifications is much needed. However, one main challenge of achieving this goal stems from defining quantitative criteria for a series of damage states that are associated with different performance levels, in relation to the functionality of the bridge. In recent years, data-driven models have been recognized as a powerful tool for making rational predictions in several structural engineering applications. Multiple linear regression (MLR) offers great potential to develop equations that are capable of identifying the maximum drift ratio limits for the four performance levels (i.e., immediate service, limited service, service disruption, and life safety) for SPPC piers. In this respect, based on a database generated from validated finite element models, MLR with stepwise backward elimination is performed in the current study using key design parameters, including concrete strength, aspect ratio, gravity load ratio, post-tension force, post-tension strand ratio, and energy dissipation bar ratio. For each damage state, a predictive equation for the threshold drift ratio is<sep>Ultrahigh-performance Concrete (UHPC) flexural members with high compression strengths need large amounts of steel confinement to meet the current code confinement requirements. This study investigated the impact of different steel confinement amounts on the flexural behavior of longitudinally reinforced UHPC beams. Four small beam specimens with different steel confinement reinforcement amounts and grades were tested under monotonic three-point loading until failure. Steel confinement reinforcement grades varied from Grade 60 to Grade 120. The confinement volumetric ratios of the four specimens were 50%, 110%, 30%, and 50% of the minimum requirement of ACI 318-14. All specimens were under-reinforced longitudinally. The specimen with the least amount of confinement failed due to excessive shear cracking. The other specimens failed under flexure in the form of longitudinal reinforcement fracture, and exhibited similar flexural strength and ductility levels regardless of the confinement amount. These results indicated the need for re-evaluating ACI 318-14 requirements on the confinement for UHPC flexural members, especially when the longitudinal reinforcement ratios are low. A numerical analysis based on section equilibrium was conducted and evaluated using the test results. The constitutive tensile model of UHPC was obtained through material tests. Several unconfined and confined concrete compression models in<sep>A novel exposed column base (ECB) connection, featuring composite yield mechanism (i.e., a combination of anchor rod and base plate yielding), has been recently proposed in Japan for optimum seismic performance. This paper focused on investigating the effects of using composite yield mechanism on damage mitigation for ECB connections. In doing so, four two-thirds scale specimens, with different base connection configurations, were tested under combined flexure and axial load. Their performances were assessed and compared in terms of damage evolution, moment-rotation relationship and energy dissipation. The experimental results showed that for ECB connection with composite yield mechanism, both anchor rod and base plate will actively contribute to the moment resistance and energy dissipation. This can successfully postpone the interior anchor rod yielding and fracture, compared to the ECB connection with anchor rod yield mechanism. Meanwhile, the strain demands on exterior plate can be also released compared to the ECB connection with base plate yield mechanism. The relative contributions from anchor rod and base plate of ECB connection with composite yield mechanism can be controlled by changing the exterior plate thickness. In addition, an analytical method was proposed to predict the yield and ultimate moment strength for the<sep>Designing precast concrete substructure connections, which adjoin a column to its foundation/cap beam, for satisfactory seismic performance is a daunting challenge to deploy Accelerated Bridge Construction in seismic regions. Among various connection types, member sockets feature the ease of construction due to their ability to provide large installation tolerances. However, their seismic application is limited, because resisting earthquake-induced loading often requires the column adjoining member sizes that exceed those in cast-in-situ construction. The member socket connection provides flexural load resistance mainly through prying action. Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), a fiber-reinforced cementitious material with exceptional tensile properties, offers substantial potential in mitigating the prying action-induced damage to the pile shaft. This research aims to analytically investigate if and to what extent the pile shaft size can be reduced due to the excellent damage control ability of UHPC. To this end, a nonlinear finite element approach is first developed to simulate the behavior of precast concrete column-to-pile shaft member socket connections under a combination of axial and reversed cyclic loads. The modeling approaches are validated by comparing the predicted behavior with the prior laboratory test results. The verified finite element model is then used to evaluate the behavior of member<sep>Self-centering, precast, post-tensioned concrete, bridge columns can provide low-damage under earthquake loading and accelerated bridge construction. These columns can also be designed so that shear-slip occurs between precast segments to provide energy dissipation. This paper, first, presents experimental results of large-scale testing of pier specimens that can self-center and undergo shear-slip under cyclic lateral loading. In these tests, segment interface properties, which control shear-slip, changed as the silicone layer placed between each segment degraded during testing. Specimens with fresh silicone had more energy dissipation, lower stiffness, and higher residual displacements compared with the ones with degraded silicone. A hysteretic model is created to predict the global load-displacement behavior of piers under lateral loading by superimposing self-centering and shear-slip responses. Shear-slip measurements under both quasi-static and rapid cyclic tests were used to characterize the interface frictional properties to be used in hysteretic modeling. Friction coefficients of segment interfaces were also investigated under varying accumulative displacement, normal force, and shear-slip velocity. The proposed hysteretic model is validated using the experimental results. A parametric study was performed using the established hysteretic model to investigate the influence of friction properties of interface materials and initial post-tension forces on the seismic response.<sep>Bridges crossing navigable waterways have a high risk for vessel collision hazard, and are meanwhile experiencing significant ‘aging’ hazard due to the surrounding aggressive environments. These bridges must be designed to be resilient to both episodic (vessel collision) and chronic (structural deterioration) hazards. To achieve this goal, this paper will develop a novel fragility assessment framework for reinforced concrete (RC) bridges under vessel collision with the corrosion-induced structural deterioration being considered. The cornerstone of this fragility assessment framework is the computational model with the capability of accurately predicting vessel impact response and corrosion-induced deterioration measures. In doing so, detailed finite element (FE) modeling approaches, including reinforcement bond-slip effects, are firstly developed and validated by the experimental results. The effects of corrosion are characterized by a series of deterioration measures that can be implemented into FE models. These FE modeling approaches were utilized to model the baseline bridge. Three different exposure periods (i.e., 0, 50, and 100 years) and two types of vessel (barge and ship) are considered. Driven by the response data generated by the FE model, a surrogate model is developed to feature both accurate vessel-impact response estimates and negligible computation cost. This surrogate model is<sep>On May 5, 2019, a truck-tractor-trailer loaded with six coils of steel crashed into a pier column of the Dongguofenli Bridge located on the Yongjin Highway in Shengzhou, China, resulting in severe damage to the impacted pier column. Prior studies on heavy truck collision with bridge piers mainly based on finite element (FE) simulations. However, none of them examined the behavior of bridges under a real vehicle-bridge collision accident. To fill in this gap, this paper aims to reproduce the Dongguofenli Bridge vehicle collision accident and scrutinize the causes of the observed bridge damages. This is achieved by using the high-resolution simulation models for both the impacted bridge structures and the colliding heavy truck. The typical heavy truck model widely used in previous studies was employed and validated based on the experimental data. Four different methods were examined to reasonably capture the soil-pile interaction behavior during vehicle collisions. Important lessons were learned from the FE simulation that reproduced this accident: 1) the characteristics of the cargo (i.e., cargo type and cargo’s fixing method) play an important role in determining the response of the bridge and 2) the damage that occurred to the bridge pier is most likely<sep>• HSS and NSS specimens failed in flexure-shear mode with a drastic loss in lateral strength. • Less HSS reinforcement affected the flexure-shear interaction of wall piers. • The loading type had negligible influence on the seismic behavior of wall piers. • The stiffness estimates per the code provisions were higher than the test results. • The nominal flexural strength per the code provisions agreed with the actual strength. The introduction of openings in structural walls could cause unfavourable seismic behaviour, leading to stringent reinforcement requirements for wall piers. High-strength steel with a reduced amount of reinforcement has the potential to relieve reinforcement congestion. However, the effect of the reduced areas of high-strength steel on the seismic performance of wall piers remains largely unknown, impeding its application in earthquake-prone areas. Through experimental investigation, this research aimed to reveal the benefits and limitations of using high-strength steel in wall piers. Four full-scale wall pier specimens with a height-to-length aspect ratio of 2.8 were subjected to lateral loading and a constant axial load.

Lateral flow assays (LFA) are a simple method for use outside specialist centers, provided performance is acceptable. The objective of this study was to determine the performance of the recently released IMMY sona Aspergillus LFA when testing serum samples. The study took the form of a retrospective, anonymous case/control study comprising 179 serum samples from 136 patients with invasive fungal disease, previously documented using recently revised internationally accepted definitions.<sep>Background: Treatment for invasive candidiasis (IC) is time-critical, and culture-based tests can limit clinical utility. Nonculture-based methods such as Candida PCR represent a promising approach to improving patient management but require further evaluation to understand their optimal role and incorporation into clinical algorithms. This study determined the performance of the commercially available OLM CandID real-time PCR when testing serum and developed a diagnostic algorithm for IC. Methods: The study comprised a retrospective performance evaluation of the CandID real-time PCR assay when testing surplus serum (n = 83 patients, 38 with IC), followed by a prospective consecutive cohort evaluation (n = 103 patients, 24 with IC) post incorporation into routine service. A combined diagnostic algorithm, also including (1-3)-β-D-Glucan testing, was generated. Results: Prospective CandID testing generated a sensitivity/specificity of 88%/82%, respectively. Specificity was improved (>95%) when both PCR replicates were positive and/or the patient had multiple positive samples. When combining CandID with (1-3)-β-D-Glucan testing, the probability of IC when both were positive or negative was >69% or <1%, respectively. Conclusions: The CandID provides excellent performance and a rapid time-to-result using methods widely available in generic molecular diagnostic laboratories. By combining nonculture diagnostics, it may be possible to accurately confirm or exclude IC.<sep>Denture-associated stomatitis (DS) affects over two-thirds of denture-wearers. DS presents as erythema of the palatal mucosa in areas where denture-surface associated polymicrobial biofilms containing the fungus Candida albicans exist. The contribution of the oral bacterial microbiota toward the infection is unknown. Therefore, this study characterised the bacterial microbiota of sites within the oral cavity to identify potential associations with occurrence of DS. Denture-wearing patients were recruited (denture stomatitis (DS) n = 8; non-denture stomatitis (NoDS) n = 11) and the oral bacterial microbiota of the tongue, palate and denture-fitting surface was characterised using next-generation sequencing. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified to bacterial genera and species, and presence/absence and relative abundances were examined. A significant (P = 0.007) decrease in the number of OTUs and thus, diversity of the microbiota was observed in tongue samples of DS patients (vs non-DS). The microbiota of denture-fitting surfaces and palatal mucosae were similar. Large differences in the abundance of bacterial genera and species were observed at each sample site, and unique presence/absence of bacteria was noted. Presence/absence and relative abundance of specific bacteria associated with DS warrants further in vitro and in vivo evaluation, particularly as our previous work has shown C. albicans virulence factor modulation by oral bacteria.<sep>Infections caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus are increasingly resistant to first-line azole antifungal drugs. However, despite its clinical importance, little is known about how susceptible patients acquire infection from drug-resistant genotypes in the environment. Here, we present a population genomic analysis of 218 A. fumigatus isolates from across the UK and Ireland (comprising 153 clinical isolates from 143 patients and 65 environmental isolates). First, phylogenomic analysis shows strong genetic structuring into two clades (A and B) with little interclade recombination and the majority of environmental azole resistance found within clade A. Second, we show occurrences where azole-resistant isolates of near-identical genotypes were obtained from both environmental and clinical sources, indicating with high confidence the infection of patients with resistant isolates transmitted from the environment. Third, genome-wide scans identified selective sweeps across multiple regions indicating a polygenic basis to the trait in some genetic backgrounds. These signatures of positive selection are seen for loci containing the canonical genes encoding fungicide resistance in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, while other regions under selection have no defined function. Lastly, pan-genome analysis identified genes linked to azole resistance and previously unknown resistance mechanisms. Understanding the environmental drivers and genetic basis of evolving fungal drug resistance needs urgent attention, especially in light of increasing numbers of patients with severe viral respiratory tract infections who are susceptible to opportunistic fungal superinfections.<sep>Rationale: Fungal co-infection is a recognised complication of respiratory virus infections, increasing morbidity and mortality, but can be readily treated if diagnosed early. An increasing number of small studies describing aspergillosis in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory distress are being reported, but comprehensive data is lacking. Objectives: To determine the incidence, risk factors and impact of invasive fungal disease in adult COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory distress. Methods: An evaluation of a national, multi-centre, prospective cohort evaluation of an enhanced testing strategy to diagnose invasive fungal disease in COVID-19 intensive care patients. Results were used to generate a mechanism to define aspergillosis in future COVID-19 patients. Measurements and Main Results: One-hundred and thirty-five adults (median age: 57, M/F: 2·2/1) were screened. The incidence was 25·9% (13·3% aspergillosis, 12·6% yeast infections). The overall mortality rate was 38%; 51% and 31% in patients with and without fungal disease, respectively (P: 0·0398). The mortality rate was reduced by the use of antifungal therapy (Mortality: 38·5% in patients receiving therapy versus 89% in patients not receiving therapy (P: 0·0178). The use of corticosteroids (P: 0·002) and history of chronic respiratory disease (P: 0·043) increased the likelihood of aspergillosis. Conclusions: Fungal disease occurs frequently in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. The survival benefit observed in patients receiving antifungal therapy implies that the proposed diagnostic and defining criteria are appropriate. Screening using a strategic diagnostic approach and antifungal prophylaxis of patients with risk factors will likely enhance the management of COVID-19 patients.<sep>Fungal coinfection is a recognized complication of respiratory virus infections, increasing morbidity and mortality, but can be readily treated if diagnosed early.

This was a retrospective case/control study, comprising 175 serum samples obtained from 131 patients, 35 of whom had probable or possible invasive fungal disease (IFD) as categorized using recently revised, internationally accepted definitions. The IMMY GM-EIA was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Performance parameters were determined and receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to identify an optimal GMI threshold. Concordance with the Bio-Rad Aspergillus Ag assay (Bio Rad GM-EIA) and IMMY sona Aspergillus lateral flow assay was assessed. The median GMIs generated by the IMMY GM-EIA for samples originating from probable IA/IFD cases (n = 31), possible IFD (n = 4), and control patients (n = 100) were 0.61, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively, and were comparable to those of the Bio-Rad GM-EIA (0.70, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively). Overall qualitative observed sample agreement between the IMMY GM-EIA and Bio-Rad GM-EIA was 94.7%, generating a kappa statistic of 0.820. At a GMI positivity threshold of ≥0.5, the IMMY GM-EIA had a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 98%, respectively. Reducing the threshold to ≥0.27 generated sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 92%, respectively. The IMMY GM-EIA provides a comparable alternative to the Bio-Rad GM-EIA when testing serum samples. Further prospective, multicenter evaluations are required to confirm the optimal threshold and associated clinical performance.<sep>While the serological detection of (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) can indicate invasive fungal disease (IFD), false positivity occurs. Nevertheless, the presence of BDG can still be recognized by the host's innate immune system and persistent BDG antigenemia, in the absence of IFD, can result in deleterious proinflammatory immune responses.During the XXX (INTENSE) study into the preemptive use of micafungin to prevent invasive candidiasis (IC) after abdominal surgery, the serum burden of BDG was determined to aid diagnosis of IC. Data from the INTENSE study were analyzed to determine whether BDG was associated with organ failure and patient mortality, while accounting for the influences of IC and antifungal therapy.A BDG concentration >100 pg/mL was associated with a significantly increased Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (≤100 pg/mL: 2 vs >100 pg/mL: 5; P < .0001) and increased rates of mortality (≤100 pg/mL: 13.7% vs >100 pg/mL: 39.0%; P = .0002). Multiple (≥2) positive results >100 pg/mL or a BDG concentration increasing >100 pg/mL increased mortality (48.1%). The mortality rate in patients with IC and a BDG concentration >100 pg/mL and ≤100 pg/mL was 42.3% and 25.0%, respectively. The mortality rate in patients without IC but a BDG concentration >100 pg/mL was 37.3%. The use of micafungin did not affect the findings.The presence of persistent or increasing BDG in the patient's circulation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality after abdominal surgery, irrespective of IC. The potential lack of a specific therapeutic focus has consequences when trying to manage these patients, and when designing clinical trials involving patients where host-associated BDG concentrations may be elevated.NCT01122368.<sep>Rationale:Aspergillus infection in patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia remains uncharacterized because of the absence of a disease definition and limited access to sensitive diagnostic tests.Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and outcomes of Aspergillus infection in adults with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.Methods: Two prospective UK studies recruited 360 critically ill adults with new or worsening alveolar shadowing on chest X-ray and clinical/hematological parameters supporting suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Stored serum and BAL fluid were available from 194 nonneutropenic patients and underwent mycological testing. Patients were categorized as having probable Aspergillus infection using a definition comprising clinical, radiological, and mycological criteria. Mycological criteria included positive histology or microscopy, positive BAL fluid culture, galactomannan optical index of 1 or more in BAL fluid or 0.5 or more in serum.Measurements and Main Results: Of 194 patients evaluated, 24 met the definition of probable Aspergillus infection, giving an estimated prevalence of 12.4% (95% confidence interval, 8.1-17.8). All 24 patients had positive galactomannan in serum (n = 4), BAL fluid (n = 16), or both (n = 4); three patients cultured Aspergillus sp. in BAL fluid. Patients with probable Aspergillus infection had a significantly longer median duration of critical care stay (25.5 vs. 15.5 d, P = 0.02). ICU mortality was numerically higher in this group, although this was not statistically significant (33.3% vs. 22.8%; P = 0.23).Conclusions: The estimated prevalence for probable Aspergillus infection in this geographically dispersed multicenter UK cohort indicates that this condition should be considered when investigating patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia, including patient groups not previously recognized to be at high risk of aspergillosis.<sep>Background: The use of the PCR to aid in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) has demonstrated excellent clinical performance, as evidenced through various systematic reviews and meta-analyses, yet there are concerns over the interpretation of positive results due to the potential presence of Pneumocystis colonization of the airways. While this can be overcome by applying designated positivity thresholds to PCR testing, the shear number of assays described limits the development of a universal threshold. Commercial assays provide the opportunity to overcome this problem, provided satisfactory performance is determined through large-scale, multi-centre evaluations. Methods: Retrospective case/control and consecutive cohort performance evaluations of the OLM PneumID real-time PCR assay were performed on DNA eluates from a range of samples sent from patients where “in-house” PCR had been performed as part of routine diagnostic testing. The clinical performance of the PneumID assay was determined before including it in a diagnostic algorithm to provide the probability of PcP (dependent on diagnostic evidence). Results: After being used to test 317 patients (32 with PcP), the overall performance of the PneumID assay was found to be excellent (Sensitivity/Specificity: 96.9%/95.1%). False positivity could be removed by applying a threshold specific to sample type (&lt;33.1 cycles for BAL fluid; &lt;37.0 cycles for throat swabs), whereas considering any positive respiratory samples as significant generated 100% sensitivity, making absolute negativity sufficient to exclude PcP. Incorporating the PneumID assay into diagnostic algorithms alongside (1-3)-β-D-Glucan testing provided high probabilities of PcP (up to 85.2%) when both were positive and very low probabilities (&lt;1%) when both were negative. Conclusions: The OLM PneumID qPCR provides a commercial option for the accurate diagnosis of PcP, generating excellent sensitivity and specificity, particularly when testing respiratory specimens. The combination of PcP PCR with serum (1-3)-β-D-Glucan provides excellent clinical utility for diagnosing PcP.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Metastasis<sep>Skeletal muscle<sep>Adenocarcinoma<sep>Loss of heterozygosity<sep>Cachexia<sep>Lung cancer<sep>KRAS<sep>Cancer<sep>Grading (engineering)<sep>Primary tumor<sep>T cell<sep>Exome<sep>Antibody<sep>Lung<sep>Immunotherapy<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Cytotoxic T cell<sep>Adipose tissue<sep>Somatic evolution in cancer<sep>H&E stain<sep>Cribriform<sep>Acinus<sep>CD8<sep>clone (Java method)<sep>Cytolysis<sep>Germinal center<sep>Liquid biopsy<sep>Transcriptome<sep>Biomarker<sep>Gene<sep>Carcinogenesis</keyword><title>The artificial intelligence-based model ANORAK improves histopathological grading of lung adenocarcinoma<sep>A local human Vδ1 T cell population is associated with survival in nonsmall-cell lung cancer<sep>Genomic–transcriptomic evolution in lung cancer and metastasis<sep>Antibodies against endogenous retroviruses promote lung cancer immunotherapy<sep>Lung adenocarcinoma promotion by air pollutants<sep>The evolution of non-small cell lung cancer metastases in TRACERx<sep>Tracking early lung cancer metastatic dissemination in TRACERx using ctDNA<sep>Evolutionary characterization of lung adenocarcinoma morphology in TRACERx<sep>The evolution of lung cancer and impact of subclonal selection in TRACERx<sep>Body composition and lung cancer-associated cachexia in TRACERx</title><abstract>The introduction of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer grading system has furthered interest in histopathological grading for risk stratification in lung adenocarcinoma. Complex morphology and high intratumoral heterogeneity present challenges to pathologists, prompting the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Here we developed ANORAK (pyrAmid pooliNg crOss stReam Attention networK), encoding multiresolution inputs with an attention mechanism, to delineate growth patterns from hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. In 1,372 lung adenocarcinomas across four independent cohorts, AI-based grading was prognostic of disease-free survival, and further assisted pathologists by consistently improving prognostication in stage I tumors. Tumors with discrepant patterns between AI and pathologists had notably higher intratumoral heterogeneity. Furthermore, ANORAK facilitates the morphological and spatial assessment of the acinar pattern, capturing acinus variations with pattern transition. Collectively, our AI method enabled the precision quantification and morphology investigation of growth patterns, reflecting intratumoral histological transitions in lung adenocarcinoma.<sep>Murine tissues harbor signature γδ T cell compartments with profound yet differential impacts on carcinogenesis. Conversely, human tissue-resident γδ cells are less well defined. In the present study, we show that human lung tissues harbor a resident Vδ1 γδ T cell population. Moreover, we demonstrate that Vδ1 T cells with resident memory and effector memory phenotypes were enriched in lung tumors compared with nontumor lung tissues. Intratumoral Vδ1 T cells possessed stem-like features and were skewed toward cytolysis and helper T cell type 1 function, akin to intratumoral natural killer and CD8+ T cells considered beneficial to the patient. Indeed, ongoing remission post-surgery was significantly associated with the numbers of CD45RA-CD27- effector memory Vδ1 T cells in tumors and, most strikingly, with the numbers of CD103+ tissue-resident Vδ1 T cells in nonmalignant lung tissues. Our findings offer basic insights into human body surface immunology that collectively support integrating Vδ1 T cell biology into immunotherapeutic strategies for nonsmall cell lung cancer.<sep>Intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) fuels lung cancer evolution, which leads to immune evasion and resistance to therapy1. Here, using paired whole-exome and RNA sequencing data, we investigate intratumour transcriptomic diversity in 354 non-small cell lung cancer tumours from 347 out of the first 421 patients prospectively recruited into the TRACERx study2,3. Analyses of 947 tumour regions, representing both primary and metastatic disease, alongside 96 tumour-adjacent normal tissue samples implicate the transcriptome as a major source of phenotypic variation. Gene expression levels and ITH relate to patterns of positive and negative selection during tumour evolution. We observe frequent copy number-independent allele-specific expression that is linked to epigenomic dysfunction. Allele-specific expression can also result in genomic-transcriptomic parallel evolution, which converges on cancer gene disruption. We extract signatures of RNA single-base substitutions and link their aetiology to the activity of the RNA-editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC3A, thereby revealing otherwise undetected ongoing APOBEC activity in tumours. Characterizing the transcriptomes of primary-metastatic tumour pairs, we combine multiple machine-learning approaches that leverage genomic and transcriptomic variables to link metastasis-seeding potential to the evolutionary context of mutations and increased proliferation within primary tumour regions. These results highlight the interplay between the genome and transcriptome in influencing ITH, lung cancer evolution and metastasis.<sep>Abstract B cells are frequently found in the margins of solid tumours as organized follicles in ectopic lymphoid organs called tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) 1,2 . Although TLS have been found to correlate with improved patient survival and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the underlying mechanisms of this association remain elusive 1,2 . Here we investigate lung-resident B cell responses in patients from the TRACERx 421 (Tracking Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Evolution Through Therapy) and other lung cancer cohorts, and in a recently established immunogenic mouse model for lung adenocarcinoma 3 . We find that both human and mouse lung adenocarcinomas elicit local germinal centre responses and tumour-binding antibodies, and further identify endogenous retrovirus (ERV) envelope glycoproteins as a dominant anti-tumour antibody target. ERV-targeting B cell responses are amplified by ICB in both humans and mice, and by targeted inhibition of KRAS(G12C) in the mouse model. ERV-reactive antibodies exert anti-tumour activity that extends survival in the mouse model, and ERV expression predicts the outcome of ICB in human lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, we find that effective immunotherapy in the mouse model requires CXCL13-dependent TLS formation. Conversely, therapeutic CXCL13 treatment potentiates anti-tumour immunity and synergizes with ICB. Our findings provide a possible mechanistic basis for the association of TLS with immunotherapy response.<sep>A complete understanding of how exposure to environmental substances promotes cancer formation is lacking. More than 70 years ago, tumorigenesis was proposed to occur in a two-step process: an initiating step that induces mutations in healthy cells, followed by a promoter step that triggers cancer development1. Here we propose that environmental particulate matter measuring ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), known to be associated with lung cancer risk, promotes lung cancer by acting on cells that harbour pre-existing oncogenic mutations in healthy lung tissue. Focusing on EGFR-driven lung cancer, which is more common in never-smokers or light smokers, we found a significant association between PM2.5 levels and the incidence of lung cancer for 32,957 EGFR-driven lung cancer cases in four within-country cohorts. Functional mouse models revealed that air pollutants cause an influx of macrophages into the lung and release of interleukin-1β. This process results in a progenitor-like cell state within EGFR mutant lung alveolar type II epithelial cells that fuels tumorigenesis. Ultradeep mutational profiling of histologically normal lung tissue from 295 individuals across 3 clinical cohorts revealed oncogenic EGFR and KRAS driver mutations in 18% and 53% of healthy tissue samples, respectively. These findings collectively support a tumour-promoting role for PM2.5 air pollutants and provide impetus for public health policy initiatives to address air pollution to reduce disease burden.<sep>Abstract Metastatic disease is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths 1 . We report the longitudinal evolutionary analysis of 126 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours from 421 prospectively recruited patients in TRACERx who developed metastatic disease, compared with a control cohort of 144 non-metastatic tumours. In 25% of cases, metastases diverged early, before the last clonal sweep in the primary tumour, and early divergence was enriched for patients who were smokers at the time of initial diagnosis. Simulations suggested that early metastatic divergence more frequently occurred at smaller tumour diameters (less than 8 mm). Single-region primary tumour sampling resulted in 83% of late divergence cases being misclassified as early, highlighting the importance of extensive primary tumour sampling. Polyclonal dissemination, which was associated with extrathoracic disease recurrence, was found in 32% of cases. Primary lymph node disease contributed to metastatic relapse in less than 20% of cases, representing a hallmark of metastatic potential rather than a route to subsequent recurrences/disease progression. Metastasis-seeding subclones exhibited subclonal expansions within primary tumours, probably reflecting positive selection. Our findings highlight the importance of selection in metastatic clone evolution within untreated primary tumours, the distinction between monoclonal versus polyclonal seeding in dictating site of recurrence, the limitations of current radiological screening approaches for early diverging tumours and the need to develop strategies to target metastasis-seeding subclones before relapse.<sep>Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be used to detect and profile residual tumour cells persisting after curative intent therapy1. The study of large patient cohorts incorporating longitudinal plasma sampling and extended follow-up is required to determine the role of ctDNA as a phylogenetic biomarker of relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we developed ctDNA methods tracking a median of 200 mutations identified in resected NSCLC tissue across 1,069 plasma samples collected from 197 patients enrolled in the TRACERx study2. A lack of preoperative ctDNA detection distinguished biologically indolent lung adenocarcinoma with good clinical outcome. Postoperative plasma analyses were interpreted within the context of standard-of-care radiological surveillance and administration of cytotoxic adjuvant therapy. Landmark analyses of plasma samples collected within 120 days after surgery revealed ctDNA detection in 25% of patients, including 49% of all patients who experienced clinical relapse; 3 to 6 monthly ctDNA surveillance identified impending disease relapse in an additional 20% of landmark-negative patients. We developed a bioinformatic tool (ECLIPSE) for non-invasive tracking of subclonal architecture at low ctDNA levels. ECLIPSE identified patients with polyclonal metastatic dissemination, which was associated with a poor clinical outcome. By measuring subclone cancer cell fractions in preoperative plasma, we found that subclones seeding future metastases were significantly more expanded compared with non-metastatic subclones. Our findings will support (neo)adjuvant trial advances and provide insights into the process of metastatic dissemination using low-ctDNA-level liquid biopsy.<sep>Lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) display a broad histological spectrum from low-grade lepidic tumors through to mid-grade acinar and papillary and high-grade solid, cribriform and micropapillary tumors. How morphology reflects tumor evolution and disease progression is poorly understood. Whole-exome sequencing data generated from 805 primary tumor regions and 121 paired metastatic samples across 248 LUADs from the TRACERx 421 cohort, together with RNA-sequencing data from 463 primary tumor regions, were integrated with detailed whole-tumor and regional histopathological analysis. Tumors with predominantly high-grade patterns showed increased chromosomal complexity, with higher burden of loss of heterozygosity and subclonal somatic copy number alterations. Individual regions in predominantly high-grade pattern tumors exhibited higher proliferation and lower clonal diversity, potentially reflecting large recent subclonal expansions. Co-occurrence of truncal loss of chromosomes 3p and 3q was enriched in predominantly low-/mid-grade tumors, while purely undifferentiated solid-pattern tumors had a higher frequency of truncal arm or focal 3q gains and SMARCA4 gene alterations compared with mixed-pattern tumors with a solid component, suggesting distinct evolutionary trajectories. Clonal evolution analysis revealed that tumors tend to evolve toward higher-grade patterns. The presence of micropapillary pattern and 'tumor spread through air spaces' were associated with intrathoracic recurrence, in contrast to the presence of solid/cribriform patterns, necrosis and preoperative circulating tumor DNA detection, which were associated with extra-thoracic recurrence. These data provide insights into the relationship between LUAD morphology, the underlying evolutionary genomic landscape, and clinical and anatomical relapse risk.<sep>Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide 1 . Here we analysed 1,644 tumour regions sampled at surgery or during follow-up from the first 421 patients with non-small cell lung cancer prospectively enrolled into the TRACERx study. This project aims to decipher lung cancer evolution and address the primary study endpoint: determining the relationship between intratumour heterogeneity and clinical outcome. In lung adenocarcinoma, mutations in 22 out of 40 common cancer genes were under significant subclonal selection, including classical tumour initiators such as TP53 and KRAS . We defined evolutionary dependencies between drivers, mutational processes and whole genome doubling (WGD) events. Despite patients having a history of smoking, 8% of lung adenocarcinomas lacked evidence of tobacco-induced mutagenesis. These tumours also had similar detection rates for EGFR mutations and for RET , ROS1 , ALK and MET oncogenic isoforms compared with tumours in never-smokers, which suggests that they have a similar aetiology and pathogenesis. Large subclonal expansions were associated with positive subclonal selection. Patients with tumours harbouring recent subclonal expansions, on the terminus of a phylogenetic branch, had significantly shorter disease-free survival. Subclonal WGD was detected in 19% of tumours, and 10% of tumours harboured multiple subclonal WGDs in parallel. Subclonal, but not truncal, WGD was associated with shorter disease-free survival. Copy number heterogeneity was associated with extrathoracic relapse within 1 year after surgery. These data demonstrate the importance of clonal expansion, WGD and copy number instability in determining the timing and patterns of relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and provide a comprehensive clinical cancer evolutionary data resource.<sep>Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer. Key features of CAC include alterations in body composition and body weight. Here, we explore the association between body composition and body weight with survival and delineate potential biological processes and mediators that contribute to the development of CAC. Computed tomography-based body composition analysis of 651 individuals in the TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) study suggested that individuals in the bottom 20th percentile of the distribution of skeletal muscle or adipose tissue area at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, had significantly shorter lung cancer-specific survival and overall survival. This finding was validated in 420 individuals in the independent Boston Lung Cancer Study. Individuals classified as having developed CAC according to one or more features at relapse encompassing loss of adipose or muscle tissue, or body mass index-adjusted weight loss were found to have distinct tumor genomic and transcriptomic profiles compared with individuals who did not develop such features. Primary non-small cell lung cancers from individuals who developed CAC were characterized by enrichment of inflammatory signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transitional pathways, and differentially expressed genes upregulated in these tumors included cancer-testis antigen MAGEA6 and matrix metalloproteinases, such as ADAMTS3. In an exploratory proteomic analysis of circulating putative mediators of cachexia performed in a subset of 110 individuals from TRACERx, a significant association between circulating GDF15 and loss of body weight, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was identified at relapse, supporting the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting GDF15 in the management of CAC.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/15055/research-associate-in-biological-chemistry/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5039577720", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5083110229", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description, showcasing extensive research in biological chemistry, particularly in the areas of fungal infections, diagnostic testing, and biomarker analysis, which are highly relevant to the role.

The framework is designed to be efficiently used for studying, prototyping and deploying smart trigger and data acquisition (TDAQ) systems for high energy physics experiments.<sep>In the near future, Exascale systems will need to bridge three technology gaps to achieve high performance while remaining under tight power constraints: energy efficiency and thermal control; extreme computation efficiency via HW acceleration and new arithmetic; methods and tools for seamless integration of reconfigurable accelerators in heterogeneous HPC multi-node platforms. TEXTAROSSA addresses these gaps through a co-design approach to heterogeneous HPC solutions, supported by the integration and extension of HW and SW IPs, programming models, and tools derived from European research.<sep>A novel methodology for detecting anomalous deformation behaviour from satellite-Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is proposed. The representation of InSAR metadata as embeddings within a deep learning framework (EE-DL) is investigated for modelling the spatio-temporal deformation response. To evaluate the performance of the EE-DL approach in SAR interferometry, we conduct experiments over a mining test site (Cadia, Australia) which has been subject to a tailings storage facility failure. This study demonstrates that EE-DL can detect and predict the fine spatial movement patterns that eventually resulted in the failure. We also compare the results with deformation predictions from a common baseline model, Random Forest.<sep>Widespread deterioration of ageing infrastructure and the recent collapses of bridge structures highlight the vital importance of structural health monitoring. Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) provides remote measurements at millimetre scale over large areas, but the interpretation of such data into civil engineering contexts remains more than a trivial task. This work presents the monitoring of Waterloo Bridge to investigate the potential for InSAR to be used to support bridge management activities. Corner reflectors and target prisms for automated total station measurements have been installed at key points of interest as part of a wider structural monitoring system, and displacement data from traditional and satellite monitoring systems are compared and studied.<sep>Ground deformation measurements from Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) and ground-based prism mon-itoring are compared to Finite Element (FE) simulation over a collapsed tailings dam. InSAR monitoring captured the complex spatial and temporal variability of TSF deformation that is not be possible from the sparse measurements offered by traditional monitoring. Potentially anomalous deformation over the failed area have been detected from InSAR one year before the failure. The InSAR monitoring data and FE modelling results were in broad agreement with ground based prism measurements, both in terms of magnitude and trends. The results, however, deviate significantly immediately pre-ceding the failure, associated to the construction of buttresses. Finally, this study illustrates the complementarity of remote sensing and geotechnical approaches for the monitoring of tailings dams.<sep>This study aims at assessing the feasibility of automatically producing analysis-ready radiometrically terrain-corrected (RTC) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) gamma nought backscatter data for ingestion into a data cube for use in a large spatio-temporal data environment. As such, this study investigates the analysis readiness of different openly available digital elevation models (DEMs) and the capability of the software solutions SNAP and GAMMA in terms of overall usability as well as backscatter data quality. To achieve this, the study builds on the Python library pyroSAR for providing the workflow implementation test bed and provides a Jupyter notebook for transparency and future reproducibility of performed analyses. Two test sites were selected, over the Alps and Fiji, to be able to assess regional differences and support the establishment of the Swiss and Common Sensing Open Data cubes respectively.<sep>Cement producers and their investors are navigating evolving risks and opportunities as the sector's climate and sustainability implications become more prominent. While many companies now disclose greenhouse gas emissions, the majority from carbon-intensive industries appear to delegate emissions to less efficient suppliers. Recognizing this, we underscore the necessity for a globally consolidated asset-level dataset, which acknowledges production inputs provenance. Our approach not only consolidates data from established sources like development banks and governments but innovatively integrates the age of plants and the sourcing patterns of raw materials as two foundational variables of the asset-level data. These variables are instrumental in modeling cement production utilization rates, which in turn, critically influence a company's greenhouse emissions. Our method successfully combines geospatial computer vision and Large Language Modelling techniques to ensure a comprehensive and holistic understanding of global cement production dynamics.<sep>Landslides can be deadly natural disaster events, particularly in Nepal, where large earthquakes along the India-Asian collision zone and intense Monsoon rainfall can trigger widespread landslides. The complex nature of the landslide causal chain makes it difficult to predict these events, and existing derivations of the link between precipitation thresholds and landslides oversimplify the relationship, do not provide predictive abilities, and therefore limit their usefulness in disaster preparedness. This paper proposes to utilize the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with open-source, space-based data, to predict landslides at the District-level in Nepal at 7-, 10-, and 14-day temporal resolutions, using calibrated precipitation estimates and geomorphic data as input. Results provide both scientific insight via feature importance analysis, and a strong predictive capability of landslide prediction in Nepal using Random Forest and U-Net models.<sep>As the so-called \"developing\" world marches rapidly forward on the paths of urban expansion, Henri Lefebvre’s hypothesis of planetary urbanisation seems increasingly inevitable. However, this article demonstrates, through the first remote sensing analysis of an informal urban agricultural practice dubbed chengshi kaihuang (urban homesteading), that the massive urbanisation of the rural can create a bottom-up countermovement that ruralizes the urban and in doing so assert significant ecological and social alterations to Western conceptions of urbanism. Taking Wuhan as the study area, this paper leverages optical remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 missions in conjunction with open access LU/LC products to study the spatial, temporal, and ecological dynamics of urban homesteading. Through machine learning techniques, the study shows that urban homesteading has constituted ~5% of Wuhan’s urban center since 2017. This paper is one of the first in-depth studies of urban homesteading, and the first to leverage remote sensing techniques.<sep>This article examines advances in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) satellite measurement technologies to understand their relevance, utilization, and limitations for bridge monitoring. Waterloo Bridge is presented as a case study to explore how InSAR data sets can be combined with traditional measurement techniques including sensors installed on the bridge and automated total stations. A novel approach to InSAR bridge monitoring was adopted by the installation of physical reflectors at key points of structural interest on the bridge, in order to supplement the bridge's own reflection characteristics and ensure that the InSAR measurements could be directly compared and combined with in situ measurements. The interpretation and integration of InSAR data sets with civil infrastructure data are more than a trivial task, and a discussion of uncertainty of measurement data is presented. Finally, a strategy for combining and interpreting varied data from multiple sources to provide useful insights into each of these methods is presented, outlining the practical applications of this data analysis to support wider monitoring strategies.<sep>In this paper, ground deformation measurements from synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) and ground-based prism monitoring are compared to finite-element (FE) simulation results for a recent tailings dam collapse. The InSAR monitoring demonstrated the complex spatial and temporal variability of the tailings dam deformation that is not captured in traditional, point-based monitoring approaches. Potentially anomalous deformation behaviour could have been detected from InSAR 1 year preceding the dam failure. A two-dimensional coupled-consolidation analysis was used to predict the dam behaviour during construction stages. The FE modelling results were in broad agreement with the deformation measurement sources, both in terms of magnitude and trends preceding failure. The results, however, deviate significantly immediately before failure, following the construction of the buttresses. Moreover, the FE modelling is sensitive to parameter uncertainties, such as spatial variability of foundation soil properties. The FE results revealed that deformation in both the upstream and downstream parts of the dam are sensitive to changing foundation properties. However, this impact is potentially much more significant on the downstream compared to the upstream parts of the dam, which are dominated by the behaviour of the tailings. This study highlights the efficacy and complementarity of geotechnical and remote sensing techniques for<sep>Detailed and complete data on physical assets are required in order to adequately assess environment-related risk and impact exposure and the diffusion of these risks and impacts through the financial system. Investors need to know where the physical assets (e.g., power plant, factory, farm) are located of companies in their portfolios, and what their polluting characteristics are. This is essential to manage these environment-related risks and to channel investments to more sustainable alternatives. At present, data on physical assets is typically incomplete, inaccurate, or not released in a timely manner. As a result, key stakeholders including asset owners, asset managers, regulators and policymakers are frequently forced to make crucial decisions with incomplete information. Accurate and comprehensive global asset-level databases are a prerequisite for meaningful innovation in green and digital finance. They provide the link between the financial system and the “real economy” and allows the wealth of EO datasets and insights that we have available to be made actionable for sustainable finance decision making. We created a framework to derive a global database of pollutant plants, such as cement, iron, and steel, which represent about 15% of the global CO2 emissions. Our solution makes use of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures<sep>Asset owners responsible for the management and maintenance of bridges value the collection of data that can be processed into useful information to inform decisions about future management of structures. Installing, powering and receiving data from sensors is not always convenient or possible, but satellite monitoring may provide the ability to measure bridge movements and thus provide an indication of potential problems for asset owners to take action on. This study presents the results of satellite monitoring of the Hammersmith flyover, London, UK, using the interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) technique. Sentinel-1 (free) and Cosmo-SkyMed (commercial) satellite radar data were processed to provide millimetre-scale measurements of the flyover and surrounding region and validated with in situ sensor measurements. A method was developed for selecting and comparing InSAR measurements with in situ displacement and temperature measurements, making use of bridge geometrical and structural modelling information. The results compare in situ sensor measurements with remote InSAR measurements and show the suitability of such measurements in measuring thermal expansion for some (but not all) bridge assets. The proposed techniques, illustrated with the case study of the Hammersmith flyover, will enable asset owners to collect regular measurements of bridge movements to complement and add value<sep>The structural health of critical transport infrastructure, such as bridges, is difficult to assess and monitor. Existing methods of evaluation rely predominantly on visual inspection and/or the installation of sensors to measure the in-situ performance of structures. There are vast numbers of critical bridge structures that need to be monitored and these are often located in diverse geographical locations which are difficult and costly to access. Recent advances in satellite monitoring using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring provide the opportunity for global coverage of assets and the measurement of displacement to sub-centimetre accuracy. Such technologies could provide bridge engineers and asset owners with insights about the health and behaviour of their assets. The key to successful implementation of InSAR monitoring of bridges lies in understanding the limitations and opportunities of InSAR, and making a clear case to satellite data providers on what specifications (resolution, frequency, processing assumptions) would unlock using such datasets for wider use in monitoring of infrastructure. This work examines the application of InSAR for bridge monitoring using case studies of several UK bridge structures. These bridge structures differ in structural form, material and environmental context, but each raise key considerations in practical application of InSAR, and<sep>Abstract We are in the midst of a revolution in satellite technology, with the rapid development and advancement of small satellites (or SmallSats, i.e., satellites &lt;180 kg). Here, we review the opportunities and challenges that such technology might afford in the field of conservation and ecology. SmallSat constellations may yield higher resolutions than those that are currently available to scientists and practitioners, increasing opportunities to improve environmental‐monitoring and animal‐tracking capabilities. They may cut access costs to end users, by reducing operational costs and bringing increased competition to the existing market. Their greater flexibility and affordability may moreover enable the development of bespoke constellations for specific conservation and ecological applications, and provide greater interoperability with ground‐based sensors, such as tracking devices and camera traps. In addition, SmallSats may serve as cost‐effective research and development platforms for new components and products. Combined, these benefits could significantly improve our ability to monitor threats to the environment as they unfold, while enhancing our understanding of animal ecology and ecosystem dynamics. However, significant hardware and software developments are required before such technology is able to produce, process and handle reliable and cost‐effective data, and the initial research and development costs still represent a major challenge.<sep>The demand for “green” metals such as lithium is increasing as the world works to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. More than half of the world’s lithium resources are contained in lithium-brine deposits, including the salt flats, or “salars”, of the Andean region of South America, also known as the Lithium Triangle. The genesis of lithium-brine deposits is largely driven by the leaching of lithium from source rocks in watersheds, transport via groundwater systems to salars, and evaporative concentration in salars. The goal of this research is to create a consistent and seamless methodology for tracking lithium mass from its source in the watershed to its greatest concentration in the nucleus. The area of interest is in and around Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni, the world’s largest salt flat. We explore how Li-brine deposits form, where the water and solute come from, how the brines are formed, and how abstraction affects the mass balance inside the salar. To support the entire system, open-source Earth observation (EO) data are analysed. We found that by constructing a flexible and repeatable workflow, the question of how lithium reaches the Salar de Uyuni can be addressed. The work demonstrated the importance of groundwater flow<sep>Abstract Turkey, as a developing country, is designing and performing massive construction projects around Istanbul. Beginning from the 1960s, rapid urbanization has been taking place due to industrialization, which brings an increase in the population. Yet, construction projects have been accelerated especially during the last decade, and many new projects are scheduled to be completed in a short time. Ground-based observations are generally carried out to monitor the deformations within construction sites, especially through geometric levelling, and GNSS techniques. However, in most cases, these monitoring measurements are only scheduled within the period of the construction process, and ensuing deformations are usually not considered. In addition to these techniques, the space-based interferometric technique can also be used to define the line of sight surface displacements with high accuracy, using the phase difference between image result for synthetic aperture radar images. In particular, Persistent Scatter Interferometry is one of the interferometric methods that are capable of defining the two-dimensional (vertical and horizontal) deformation for the desired epoch with a high temporal resolution. Thus it can be used as a complementary method for monitoring ground deformations, where the measurement is made by ground-based observations. In this study, the deforming areas related to underground<sep>Abstract. We present repeated radio-echo sounding (RES, 5 MHz) on a profile grid over the eastern Skaftá cauldron (ESC) in Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland. The ESC is a ∼ 3 km wide and 50–150 m deep ice cauldron created and maintained by subglacial geothermal activity of ∼ 1 GW. Beneath the cauldron and 200–400 m thick ice, water accumulates in a subglacial lake and is released semi-regularly in jökulhlaups. The RES record consists of annual surveys conducted at the beginning of every summer during the period 2014–2020. Comparison of the RES surveys reveals variable lake area (0.5–4.1 km2) and enables traced reflections from the lake roof to be distinguished from bedrock reflections. This allows construction of a digital elevation model (DEM) of the bedrock in the area, further constrained by two borehole measurements at the cauldron centre. It also allows creation of lake thickness maps and an estimate of lake volume at the time of each survey, which we compare with lowering patterns and released water volumes obtained from pre- and post-jökulhlaup surface DEMs. The estimated lake volume was 250 GL (gigalitres = 106 m3) in June 2015, but 320 ± 20 GL drained from the ESC in October 2015.<sep>There is a critical need for a global monitoring capability for Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs), to help protect the surrounding communities and the environment. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) shows much promise towards this ambition. However, extracting meaningful information and interpreting the deformation patterns from InSAR data can be a challenging task. One approach to address this challenge is through the use of data science techniques. In this study, the representation of InSAR metadata as Entity Embeddings within a Deep Learning framework (EE-DL) is investigated for modelling the spatio-temporal deformation response. Entity embeddings are commonly used in natural-language-processing tasks. They represent discrete objects, such as words, as continuous, low-dimensional vectors that can be manipulated mathematically. We demonstrate that EE-DL can be used to predict anomalous patterns in the InSAR time series. To evaluate the performance of the EE-DL approach in SAR interferometry, we conducted experiments over a mining test site (Cadia, Australia), which has been subject to a TSF failure. This study demonstrated that EE-DL can detect and predict the fine spatial movement patterns that eventually resulted in the failure. We also compared the results with deformation predictions from common baseline models, the Random Forest model and Gaussian Process<sep>Massive amounts of land are being reclaimed to build airports, new cities, ports, and highways. Hundreds of kilometers are added each year, as coastlines are extended further out to the sea. In this paper, this urbanization approach is monitored by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique with Sentinel-1 SAR data. The study aims to explore this technology in order to support local authorities to detect and evaluate subtle terrain displacements. For this purpose, a large 3-years Sentinel-1 stack composed by 92 images acquired between 07/01/2015 to 27/01/2018 is employed and stacking techniques are chosen to assess ground motion. The test site of this study, Rize, Turkey, has been declared at high risk of collapse and radical solutions such as the relocation of the entire city in another area are been taken into consideration. A media fact-checking approach, i.e. evaluating national and international press releases on the test site, is considered for the paper and this work presents many findings in different areas of the city. For instance, alerts are confirmed by inspecting several buildings reported by the press. Critical infrastructures are monitored as well. Portions of the harbor show high displacement rates, up to 1 cm/year, proving reported warnings. Rural villages<sep>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The increasing global effort to overcome the reliance on fossil fuels is driving the demand for &amp;amp;#8216;green&amp;amp;#8217; metals such as lithium. This study aims to develop a repeatable and seamless workflow to track the mass of lithium from its source in the watershed surrounding South American salt lakes (&amp;amp;#8220;salars&amp;amp;#8221;) to the nucleus of the salar itself. The area of interest is in and around the Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, the largest salt flat in the world. We aim to create an understanding of how Li brine deposits develop, where the water and solute comes from, how the brines are created and how does abstraction affect the mass balance within the salar. For this research, open source Earth observation (EO) data is analysed to support geological and hydrological research. We explore the potentials of EO data for several research aspects, such as (1) Jointing: it may influence fracture-flow of groundwater and also be significant in terms of surface-area for water-rock interaction, i.e. potentially increasing the &amp;amp;#8216;leaching&amp;amp;#8217; rates of Li from the bedrock into the water; (2) Weathering: the degree and style of weathering may influence the liberation of Li from rocks into the water; (3) Distribution of clays: the distribution of<sep>Information about a company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance has become increasingly important in the decision-making process of financial institutions. The financial implications of environmental challenges (e.g. water stress), negative social impacts (e.g. health impacts in local communities) or poor corporate governance (e.g. breaching legislation) all continue to increase. Accordingly, there is a need for financial institutions to incorporate information on ESG risks, opportunities and impacts in decisions that relate to risk management, investments, credit, strategy, and reporting. ESG information is typically disseminated through ESG ratings, which combine the three constituents into a single rating, or ascribe them separate scores. The compilation of ESG ratings and the identification of appropriate data sources is an inherently complex process; as such, there is no single standard for data collection or reporting. This has led to a divergence in the underlying data sources used by different rating providers, as well as in the determination of factors that are deemed worthy of measurement in the first place. For example, when assessing a company's environmental impact, one rating provider may rely on company-provided data, while another may incorporate independent third-party assessments.

A small community of cats inhabits a purpose built ‘cat utopia’ at the centre of which a robot arm tries to enrich their lives by playing with them. We initially present the design of Cat Royale as an autonomous system, but then reflect on how diverse human (and animal) stakeholders were required to enable its development and live operation when adopting an approach shaped by responsible research and innovation (RRI). In so doing, we unpack how Cat Royale speaks to three core issues of autonomy, trustworthiness and responsibility relevant to the TAS community more broadly.<sep>Abstract Understanding how animals might make sense of the interfaces they interact with is important to inform the design of animal-centered interactions. In this regard, biosemiotics provides a useful lens through which to examine animals’ interactions with interfaces and the sensemaking mechanisms that might underpin such interactions. This paper leverages Uexküll’s Umwelt theory , Peirce’s logic of sign relations and Gibson’s theory of affordances to analyze examples of dogs’ interactions with interfaces, particularly the role of the semiotic mechanisms of indexicality and isomorphism . Based on these analyses, the paper derives design implications, and proposes a semiotic framework to support the analysis and design of canine-centered interactions. The framework could be subsequently extended to support the analysis and design of interactive systems for other species.<sep>The last decade has witnessed the expansion of design space to include the epistemologies and methodologies of more-than-human design (MTHD). Design researchers and practitioners have been increasingly studying, designing for, and designing with nonhumans. This panel will bring together HCI experts who work on MTHD with different nonhumans as their subjects. Panelists will engage the audience through discussion of their shared and diverging visions, perspectives, and experiences, and through suggestions for opportunities and challenges for the future of MTHD. The panel will provoke the audience into reflecting on how the emergence of MTHD signals a paradigm shift in HCI and human-centered design, what benefits this shift might bring and whether MTH should become the mainstream approach, as well as how to involve nonhumans in design and research.<sep>Animals can be negatively affected by wearable tracking devices, even those marketed as ?animal friendly' and increasingly used with companion animals, such as cats. To understand the wearer experience of cats fitted with popular GPS trackers, we measured the behavior of 13 feline participants while they were wearing the devices during a field study. The aim of our behavioral analysis was twofold: investigating potential signs of discomfort generated by the devices to evaluate the impact that such interventions have on cat wearers; identifying wearability flaws that might account for the observed impact and wearability requirements to improve the design of the devices. Based on our findings, we propose a set of requirements that should inform the design of trackers to afford better wearability and thus provide better wearer experience for cat wearers.<sep>Participatory Design strives to open up the decision-making process and empower all those who may be affected by design. This is opposed to Design as a non-participatory process, in which the power to make decisions is vested in the hands of one group to the possible detriment of others. In this paper we interrogate the nature, possibilities and limitations of Participatory Design through the perspective of Child Computer Interaction (CCI) and Animal Computer Interaction (ACI). Due to the cognitive and communication characteristics, and to the social and legal status of their participants, researchers in these communities have to contend with and challenge existing notions of participation and design. Thus, their theories and practices provide a lens through which the nature and goals of Participatory Design can be examined with a view to facilitating the development of more inclusive participatory models and practices.<sep>Dogs are being increasingly exposed to interactive technology aiming to entertain them with playful experiences. However, work that investigates how dogs engage with tangible play interfaces, whether they manifest different interaction patterns and how these might relate to their personality has so far been limited. In this paper, we explore how dogs interact with a novel physical game. Our study involved 60 participants, whose personality was assessed using a standard personality test and whose interactions and behaviours during the game were observed. Findings suggest that dogs' engagement with physical games presents with specific interaction styles and behavioural patterns, and that these might correlate with specific personality characteristics. These engagement modalities could provide a criterion to customise the design of interactive games for dogs and optimise their gaming experience. Additionally, findings suggest the possibility that identifying relevant personality characteristics could help predict dogs' preferred engagement modalities.<sep>Animal Computer Interaction, aims to design user centered interactions that result in good user experiences (UX). During evaluation, the quality of the UX is assessed by measuring the degree to which the interaction between the user and the artefact meets the users' needs and preferences, as evidenced by their behavior. A key measure of the UX is usability. When evaluating usability for different species, ACI researchers face two major challenges: the differences in cognitive, physical and sensory capabilities between human evaluators and animal users, with the implications these differences have for assessing the users' behavior; and the human-centric focus of most usability evaluation methods currently available. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Method for Evaluating Animal Usability (MEAU), here tailored to Mobility Assistance Dogs as the users, and illustrates its application during a study that compared the canine usability of different access controls.<sep>While ACI researchers aspire to design animal-centred technology, they must operate within socio-economic systems that are not necessarily animal-centred. This creates a tension between researchers’ endeavour to address the immediate needs of animals in specific situations through technological interventions, on the one hand, and these interventions’ wider implications and consequences for the situation and life of various animal stakeholders beyond specific ACI projects, on the other hand. In this paper, we focus on the political nature of ACI, drawing from literature on political interaction design, which argues that designers should work towards social justice. Drawing from political philosophies, we then explore how extending the notion of social justice to animals might help define a political notion of animal centredness in ACI. Finally, through the lens of this notion of animal centredness, we consider the relevance of previously proposed strategies for political interaction design and propose an approach that could support ACI researchers’ political engagement in animal-centred design.<sep>This workshop aims to explore the applicability of Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) research ethics beyond the field's remit, to develop an animal-centered approach to the use of animals in research more broadly. The event is part of a longer-term project aiming to rearticulate the framework of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement). The workshop is targeted at researchers from different disciplines, with expertise on animal research from different perspectives. The event will involve group work sessions during which participants will discuss diverse case studies, exploring the applicability of animal-centered ethics principles when designing research that involves animals, and plenary discussions during which participants will share challenges identified, collectively explore possible ways to address them in practice and produce policy suggestions to facilitate the implementation of scenario-specific trade-offs. The workshop will be run both in presence and virtually, to promote inclusion of participants from different geographic areas. A key outcome of the event will be the establishment of a working group to develop a framework and provide a resource for researchers and practitioners whose work involves animals and for whom the application of animal-cantered technologies, methods or frameworks may be relevant.<sep>The principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement (3Rs) were developed to address the ethical dilemma that arises from the use of animals, without their consent, in procedures that may harm them but that are deemed necessary to achieve a greater good. While aiming to protect animals, the 3Rs are underpinned by a process-centered ethical perspective which regards them as instruments in a scientific apparatus. This paper explores the applicability of an animal-centered ethics to animal research, whereby animals would be regarded as autonomous subjects, legitimate stakeholders in and contributors to a research process, with their own interests and capable of consenting and dissenting to their involvement. This perspective derives from the ethical stance taken within the field of Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI), where researchers acknowledge that an animal-centered approach is essential to ensuring the best research outcomes. We propose the ethical principles of relevance, impartiality, welfare and consent , and a scoring system to help researchers and delegated authorities assess the extent to which a research procedure aligns with them. This could help researchers determine when being involved in research is indeed in an animal's best interests, when a procedure could be adjusted to increase its ethical standard or when the use of non-animal methods is more urgently advisable. We argue that the proposed principles should complement the 3Rs within an integrated ethical framework that recognizes animals' autonomy, interests and role, for a more nuanced ethical approach and for supporting the best possible research for the benefit animal partakers and wider society.<sep>Designers and researchers who work with animals need to employ an array of ethical competencies to guarantee the welfare of animals taking part in animal-centered research. The emerging field of Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI), which deals with the design of animal-centered interactive systems, considers ethics a fundamental concern when working with animals, and ACI researchers have proposed ethics frameworks in response to these concerns. Ethical approaches proposed within the field tend to be normative but, on their own, norms may not be sufficient to support designers who will inevitably face unexpected and ethically charged situations as the research progresses. During a research project, focused on the design of dog-friendly controls for Mobility Assistance Dogs (MADs), these limitations came to the fore. Drawing from situated ethics approaches, developed to support researchers' ethical engagement with vulnerable populations such as children and differently abled adults, this paper presents an ethics toolkit that aims to support animal-centered research and design by enabling researchers to make ethically sound situated decisions as their work progresses. The toolkit comprises three templates, each of which asks a series of questions aiming to articulate the ethical baselines of individual team members and of their research project, and to inform the development of a series of ethical guiding statements to better prepare designers to make ethical situated decisions. The application of the toolkit during the research with MADs helped the field researcher to clearly and systematically articulate the project's ethos and understand the ethical stance that guided the research team's interactions with the dogs, their trainers, and their human partners throughout the project. It also fostered a practice of active reflection within the team, which helped them to maintain their commitment to the project's ethos in the face of unexpected ethical challenges. We propose that, beyond supporting ACI research, the toolkit could support the ethical engagement of researchers and practitioners who work for and with animals in many other settings.<sep>The aim of this research was to discover if artificial neural networks can be used to classify pressure sensor data generated by medical detection dogs as they sniff biological samples. A detection dog can be trained to recognise the odour emitted by one of a wide range of diseases such as prostate cancer, malaria or, potentially, COVID-19. The dog searches a row of sample pots and indicates a positive sample by sitting in front of it. This offers a non-invasive means of diagnosing the specific cancer or disease that the dog has been trained to recognise. For this study, pressure sensors were attached to the sample pots to generate time series data pertaining to the dog’s searching behaviour as they press their nose against the sample pot to sniff its content. Automatic classification could provide a second form of indication, to support or refute the dog’s explicit signal (to sit at a positive sample), which is not always correct. Ultimately, classification software could eliminate the need for the dog to perform an indication gesture, making the dog’s task easier and training quicker. Four different neural network architectures were evaluated: multilayer perceptron (MLP), a convolutional neural network (CNN), a fully convolutional network (FCN) and ResNet (a deep convolutional neural network). Each model was trained to classify the pressure data generated by medical detection dogs. To achieve a useful level of accuracy, it was found that the models needed to be trained using only those data samples where the dog had correctly classified the scent sample. Model hyperparameters were tuned to improve accuracy. We found that the best performing model was MLP. When tested on previously unseen data, where the dog was not always correct, the classification performance of the MLP approached that of the medical detection dogs. For our particular dataset, the model’s true positive rate (i.e. recall) was 59%, matching that of the dogs. The model’s true negative rate was 79%, compared to the dogs’ 91%.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/98584/professor-tf-in-immersive-engineering/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5002521229", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5010107522", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates extensive expertise in immersive media components and engineering processes, particularly through their work with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and InSAR technologies, which aligns closely with the job description's requirements for practical experience in immersive media creation and teaching.

Our review reveals that a large volume of empirical research has been conducted on the determinants of debt maturity structure, and we categorize these determinants into the following five factors: (1) firm specific; (2) tax; (3) corporate governance; (4) country-level institutional; and (5) macroeconomic. The literature on the consequences of debt maturity structure is relatively scant and generally focuses on the effect of debt maturity structure on financial reporting quality and investment and financing decisions. We consider endogeneity as one of the major concerns in the reported empirical studies that, unless addressed satisfactorily, may render some of the findings untenable. Based on the review, we also provide several future research directions.<sep>We examine the asymmetric cost behaviour of firms during seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Using a sample of US firms that issued SEOs over the period 1995–2020, we find a reduction in cost asymmetry for SEO firms. We also demonstrate that managerial resource adjustment decisions are driven by stronger external monitoring instead of managerial entrenchment. We find that competent managers make efficient resource adjustments, but they are able to do so when they operate under excess capacity. Further, we find that SEOs retain slack resources when demand declines in periods following the SEO. Finally, we find that the lower cost asymmetry during SEOs improves future firm performance. Our results are robust to several categories of cost, different measures of firm performance and different model specifications. This study contributes to the literature by documenting managerial cost management decisions around SEOs.<sep>Carbon emissions and agency costs can have an impact on firms’ financial performance. However, limited attention has been paid to the combined and gradual effects of these two factors on firms’ performance. We explore the separate and combined effects of carbon emissions and agency costs on firms’ financial performance by utilizing data from 2323 US firms that disclosed their environmental information to CDP from 2007 to 2016. The results indicate that firms with higher carbon emissions experience lower performance as the market reacts negatively. Further, firms with both higher carbon emissions and higher agency costs have lower performance. We also investigated year-on-year change in firm performance and found that, keeping agency costs constant, a change in carbon emissions leads to lower performance. Overall, the findings suggest that when the market responds negatively to firms’ environmental decisions, high agency costs exacerbate the adverse effect of high carbon emissions on firm performance.<sep>Abstract We examine the association between audit committee (AC) busyness and financial restatement and determine whether AC share ownership moderates this relationship. Using logit regression analysis, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 6408 firm‐year observations from 2004 to 2015 for companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The study reveals that firms with busy ACs engage more in financial restatements. We also find that AC share ownership reduces financial restatements and attenuates the association between AC busyness and financial restatement. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns emanating from firms’ deliberate decisions to grant shares to AC members. The findings of this research have several important policy implications. For instance, shareholders can benefit from AC members’ monitoring ability by allowing for share ownership. Further, our findings suggest that principles‐based corporate governance guidelines have a beneficial effect on financial reporting quality. While prior studies offer mixed evidence, our research contributes to the auditing literature by providing evidence that AC share ownership moderates the association between AC busyness and financial restatement.<sep>A large number of empirical studies have addressed the effects of adoption of IFRS, but the results have been mixed. We use a meta-analysis of 55 empirical studies with 1,259 effect sizes to determine the impact of adoption of IFRS on financial reporting comparability, market liquidity, cost of equity and cost of debt. This approach provides an objective view of the empirical results, in contrast to narrative reviews, which offer subjective conclusions. We find that IFRS adoption has increased financial reporting comparability, market liquidity, and reduced cost of equity. For cost of debt, decrease is observed only for voluntary adoption. Our meta-regression analysis shows how the results differ across mandatory and voluntary adoption of IFRS and that the measurement choices, type of control variables, study design, and strength of results explain the variation in the observed effect of adoption of IFRS. We emphasise the importance of these study characteristics and call for further studies using more recent data, on the debt market, and the long-term effect of IFRS adoption. This study should be of interest to regulators and policymakers as they are expected to assess the impacts of adoption of IFRS.<sep>A large number of empirical studies have addressed the effects of adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), but the results have been mixed. We use a meta‐analysis of 56 empirical studies with 1,265 effect sizes to determine the impact of adoption of IFRS on financial reporting comparability, market liquidity, cost of equity, and cost of debt. This approach provides an objective view of the empirical results, in contrast to narrative reviews which offer subjective conclusions. We find that IFRS adoption has increased financial reporting comparability and market liquidity, and reduced the cost of equity. For cost of debt, a decrease is observed only for voluntary adoption. Our meta‐regression analysis explains the variation in the observed effect of adoption of IFRS across mandatory and voluntary adoption of IFRS, and choice of measures, control variables, estimation methods, and the strength of the empirical results. We emphasize the importance of these study characteristics and call for further studies focusing on the cost of debt and also studies using recent data to reflect the changes in IFRS. This study should be of interest to regulators and policymakers as they are expected to assess the impacts of adoption of IFRS.<sep>This study uses a cross-country sample to examine the impact of adoption of IFRS on seasoned equity offering (SEO) underperformance. The empirical literature on SEOs has established that information uncertainties contribute to SEO underperformance. Given the growing number of countries that have adopted IFRS, it is therefore important to assess whether adoption of IFRS reduces the uncertainties surrounding SEOs and, thus, subsequent underperformance. The study employs a control sample of non-IFRS adoption countries and applies a difference-in-difference design to capture the incremental change between the treatment and control samples. We find that SEO underperformance decreases for IFRS adopters. The decrease in SEO underperformance is influenced by increased disclosure, increased comparability, and number of accounting changes. We find that the impact of adoption of IFRS on SEO underperformance exists only for firms in countries with strong enforcement, and is conditional on the implementation credibility of countries. These findings are statistically robust to the application of different measures of SEO underperformance, but vary in economic terms. Overall, our study provides global evidence on SEOs and potentially encourages firms to increase disclosure of financial information and to consider issuing SEOs in countries that enforce standards and implement the standards credibly.<sep>Purpose This purpose of this study is to examine the association between earnings management (accruals earnings management (AEM) and/or real activities manipulation (RAM)) and firm underperformance following seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) using cross-country data. Design/methodology/approach The study applies ordinary least squares regression analyses to a sample of 11,764 observations on firms from 22 countries over the period from 2005 to 2017. The methods include weighted least squares regression, sub-sampling approach and alternative measures of firm performance, earnings management and legal regime for robustness tests as well as a two-stage least squares instrumental variable (IV) approach to address endogeneity concerns. Findings The results suggest that RAM has a greater negative impact on post-SEO performance than AEM. The result is economically significant for RAM only. The results also reveal that the negative impact of earnings management, in particular RAM, on post-SEO performance is greater in countries with a strong legal regime than in other countries. Practical implications Earnings management around SEOs has important implications for investors, regulators and policymakers. The study suggests that policymakers should improve the current legal conditions to promote fairness in the equity market. Originality/value The results from the cross-country data support earlier results from single-country studies on the impact of earnings management on post-SEO performance. The study also provides new evidence on the variation in the impact of earnings management according to the strength of the legal regime operating in a country.<sep>Purpose This research aims to revisit Gul and Goodwin (2010), which focuses on exploring the relationship between debt maturity structure, credit ratings and audit fees. Furthermore, the authors investigate whether this association varies based on firm size, firm life cycle and financial reporting quality. Design/methodology/approach To investigate the research question, the authors use an extended sample period, 2004–2017, in comparison to the sample period, 2003–2006, used in Gul and Goodwin (2010). The authors use ordinary least squares regression as a baseline methodology along with two-stage least-squares regression and change analysis to control for endogeneity concerns. Findings According to Gul and Goodwin (2010), auditors charge lower audit fees for firms with higher short-maturity debt and better credit ratings, indicating a lower likelihood of financial misreporting. Further, Gul and Goodwin (2010) find that lower credit rated firms benefit more from short-term debt. Primarily, the findings are consistent with Gul and Goodwin (2010) and provide further evidence that the beneficial effects of short-maturity debt for firms with poor ratings are evident for small firms, firms in the growth stage of their life cycle and firms with poor earnings quality. Practical implications The findings imply that practitioners in the audit profession and investors should take a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to varied firm and financial factors, taking into consideration the intricate relationships between many elements impacting a firm’s financial health. As a result, audit professionals may give more accurate appraisals of a firm’s financial condition, and investors can make better investment decisions. Originality/value The authors reconfirm the findings of Gul and Goodwin (2010) using an extended sample. The findings are novel, which evidence that the lower audit fees for rated firms with short-maturity debt are moderated by firm size, life cycle and financial reporting quality.<sep>&lt;p&gt;This thesis examines the impact of adoption of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) on two aspects of the operation of capital markets. Firstly, the impact of adoption of IFRS on financial reporting comparability, market liquidity, and cost of capital. Secondly, the impact of adoption of IFRS on seasoned equity offering (SEO) underperformance. To examine the impact of adoption of IFRS on financial reporting comparability, market liquidity, and cost of capital, the study used meta-analysis of empirical studies published since 2000. Meta-analysis provides an objective view of the empirical results, in contrast to narrative reviews, which offer subjective conclusions. From meta-analysis of 55 empirical studies with 1,259 effect sizes, the study finds that IFRS adoption has increased financial reporting comparability, market liquidity, and reduced cost of equity. For cost of debt, a decrease is observed only for voluntary adoption. The meta-regression analysis shows how the results differ across mandatory and voluntary adoption of IFRS and that the measurement choices, type of control variables, study design, and strength of empirical results explain the variation in the observed effect of adoption of IFRS. To examine the impact of adoption of IFRS on SEO underperformance the study analyses a large sample of SEOs from 51 countries over the period 1992-2017. Given that the empirical literature on SEOs has established that information asymmetry contributes to SEO underperformance, it is important to assess whether adoption of IFRS has reduced the uncertainties surrounding SEOs and, thus, subsequent underperformance. The study employs a control sample of non-IFRS adoption countries and applies a difference-in-difference (DiD) design to test for the incremental change for IFRS adoption countries over non-IFRS adoption countries. The study finds that SEO underperformance reduces for IFRS adopters relative to non-IFRS adopters in the post-adoption period. The reduction in SEO underperformance is influenced by increased disclosure, increased comparability, and number of accounting changes. The study also finds that the impact of adoption of IFRS on SEO underperformance exists only for firms in countries with strong enforcement, and is conditional on the implementation credibility of countries. The findings are robust to the application of a different measure of SEO underperformance. Overall, the study suggests that IFRS has had a positive impact on capital markets. However, increased disclosure, comparability, and credible implementation play important roles in realising the benefits of adoption of IFRS. Thus, policymakers of weak enforcement countries are encouraged to strengthen their institutional environment in order to reap the benefits that adoption of IFRS can provide to their capital market.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Job creation<sep>Spurious relationship<sep>Field (mathematics)<sep>Cash<sep>Equity (law)<sep>Earnings<sep>Social network analysis<sep>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sep>Quarter (Canadian coin)<sep>Reprint<sep>Social media<sep>Financial crisis<sep>Globe<sep>Framing (construction)<sep>Population<sep>Small and medium-sized enterprises<sep>Event (particle physics)<sep>Shock (circulatory)<sep>Ecosystem<sep>Argumentation theory<sep>Bond market<sep>Small business<sep>Appeal<sep>Entrepreneurship<sep>Underpinning<sep>Entrepreneurial finance</keyword><title>Places are not like people: the perils of anthropomorphism within entrepreneurial ecosystems research<sep>Getting left behind?

The crisis and SMEs<sep>Reprint of: Capturing conversations in entrepreneurial ecosystems</title><abstract>The concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) has quickly established itself as a major focus within regional development research. A key conceptual framing commonly adopted by scholars theorizing about the growth and evolutionary dynamics of EEs is via anthropomorphized life-cycle models. In this article we offer a critique and argumentation as to why the validity of this approach is spurious and contestable. Arguably, life-cycle-based models overly simplify these complex spatial entrepreneurial phenomena and convey the temporal evolution of EEs as a simplistic, linear, deterministic and path-dependent process. Despite the seductively simplistic appeal of life-cycle models, places are not like people and the uncritical adoption of such crude anthropomorphic framings potentially weakens this research field, at the same time as running the risk of misinforming policymakers.<sep>Abstract Recent research has identified a key subset of the business population that comprises firms who had sought external finance but subsequently withdrew from the credit market completely despite still requiring finance. Utilising the UK’s Longitudinal Small Business Survey between 2015 and 2020, we identify the consequences in terms of lost jobs and sales of these small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dropping out of the credit market for finance. We conduct our analysis at the regional and sub-regional level and found that around 230,000 SMEs have dropped out of the UK credit market and that in many localities this has reduced job creation and sales income growth. We conclude that this exclusionary borrowing behaviour will add further to existing regional and sub-regional economic inequalities in the UK, making the ‘levelling up’ agenda a very elusive policy objective.<sep>This commentary explores the manner in which the current COVID-19 crisis is affecting key sources of entrepreneurial finance in the United Kingdom. We posit that the unique relational nature of entrepreneurial finance may make it highly susceptible to such a shock owing to the need for face-to-face interaction between investors and entrepreneurs. The article explores this conjecture by scrutinising a real-time data source of equity investments. Our findings suggest that the volume of new equity transactions in the United Kingdom has declined markedly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It appears that seed finance is the main type of entrepreneurial finance most acutely affected by the crisis, which typically goes to the most nascent entrepreneurial start-ups facing the greatest obstacles obtaining finance. Policy makers can utilise these real-time data sources to help inform their strategic policy interventions to assist the firms most affected by crisis events.<sep>This paper examines a novel and innovative methodological approach and dataset for measuring the complex relational dynamics underpinning entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs). Existing measurement techniques have largely failed to yield sufficiently nuanced data or insights to inform robust policy recommendations within this research field. To rectify this situation, this paper sets out a novel approach to assessing the relational connectivity within EEs by capturing entrepreneurial \"conversations\". Drawing on real-time data extracted from an event-based social media platform, in combination with social network analysis and qualitative interview data, we provide an in-depth assessment of the relational connections within the city of Edinburgh at three analytical levels. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the analysis of conversations and conversational spaces is an important mechanism for exploring and mapping the relational connectivity within EEs. As well as producing novel empirical insights, this approach provides policy makers with vital strategic policy intelligence to help better inform public policy frameworks and associated interventions.<sep>This paper illustrates how chronic uncertainty caused by crisis events affects the availability of entrepreneurial sources of finance for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To explore this line of argument, this paper examines Crunchbase real-time data examining entrepreneurial finance investments in China during unfolding Covid-19 crisis. The paper shows that these equity investments slumped dramatically in the immediate aftermath of the Covid-19 virus, resulting in a year on year decrease of 60% in the total volume of investment raised between quarter 1 in 2019 and quarter 1 in 2020. Importantly, the paper found early-stage seed investments falling the steepest, suggesting nascent start-ups are those most heavily affected by the crisis. While the global financial crisis heavily hit debt markets, the relational nature of equity investments may mean entrepreneurial finance is even more susceptible to major upheaval caused by the Covid-19 crisis. Overall, enterprise policy makers need to become better attuned at monitoring real-time data sources to mitigate chronic entrepreneurial uncertainty via strategic policy responses.<sep>As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, a common public policy response has been to enforce the temporary closure of non-essential business activity. In some countries, governments have underwritten a proportion of the wage income for staff forced to furlough or broadened their welfare systems to accommodate newly laid off workers or small business owners. While these actions are helpful, they do not explicitly address the lack of sales trading activity on business income and cash balances. In commentary, we identify what types of businesses have been increasing their cash holdings in the lead up to COVID-19 as an indication of what types of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are most at risk if the lockdown extends for a protracted period of time. We find that only 39% of the of businesses were bolstering their cash balances leading up to COVID-19 which suggests that 61% of businesses may run out of cash, including 8.6% that had no retained earnings whatsoever with micro firms at particular risk. The importance of precautionary saving for SMEs is critical to enhance resilience when Black Swan events occur.<sep>This paper examines a novel and innovative methodological approach and dataset for measuring the complex relational dynamics underpinning entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs). Existing measurement techniques have largely failed to yield sufficiently nuanced data or insights to inform robust policy recommendations within this research field. To rectify this situation, this paper sets out a novel approach to assessing the relational connectivity within EEs by capturing entrepreneurial \"conversations\". Drawing on real-time data extracted from an event-based social media platform, in combination with social network analysis and qualitative interview data, we provide an in-depth assessment of the relational connections within the city of Edinburgh at three analytical levels. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the analysis of conversations and conversational spaces is an important mechanism for exploring and mapping the relational connectivity within EEs. As well as producing novel empirical insights, this approach provides policy makers with vital strategic policy intelligence to help better inform public policy frameworks and associated interventions. • Existing measurement techniques examining entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) have largely failed to yield sufficiently nuanced insights. • This paper offers a novel data-driven methodological framework for examining EEs. • It draws on “real-time” data extracted from a digital meetup platform to undertake social network analysis within the Edinburgh EE. • This methodological approach provides policy makers with vital “strategic policy intelligence” to help inform public policy frameworks.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/257269/lecturer-senior-lecturer-in-accountancy/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5042947335", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5087556703", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description through their extensive research in accounting-related themes such as auditing, capital markets, corporate governance, and financial reporting, which are directly relevant to the Department's focus areas.

To understand which factors caused extinctions, we quantitatively investigated the relationship between geochemical proxies and fossil record at the most intensively-studied locality for this event, the Meishan section, China. We found that δ 18 O apatite (paleotemperature proxy) and δ 114 Cd (primary productivity proxy) best explain changes in species diversity and composition at Meishan’s paleoequatorial setting. These findings suggest that the physiological stresses induced by ocean warming and nutrient availability played a predominant role in driving equatorial marine extinctions during the Permian-Triassic event. This research enhances our understanding of the interplay between environmental changes and extinction dynamics during a past climate crisis. One-Sentence Summary Ocean warming and nutrient availability were key drivers of equatorial marine extinctions during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.<sep>Reconstructing fluctuations in marine and atmospheric redox conditions during the late Precambrian/Early Cambrian is essential to better our understanding of the link between oxygen and biological evolution. This study presents REE+Y and Cr isotopic data together with TOC data and redox-sensitive trace metal concentrations of marine black shales and cherts from the Cambrian Jiumenchong Formation and Ediacaran Liuchapo Formation from South China, in order to improve our understanding of the redox conditions in the Nanhua basin during this critical time period. The Liuchapo Formation records negative Ce anomalies and highly fractionated δ53Cr values of up to 1.06 ± 0.09‰, suggesting deposition under oxic conditions and implying high oxidative weathering rates during the end of the Ediacaran. The overlying Jiumenchong Formation is characterised by a stratigraphic upward decrease in δ53Cr values to typical igneous values as well as a decrease in negative Ce anomalies and an increase in positive Eu anomalies, suggesting an increase in detrital content due to more aeolian weathering and deposition under anoxic conditions at the beginning of the Cambrian. The latter is also confirmed by the trends in V/Cr and Th/U ratios, which further indicate an eventual return to (dys-)oxic seawater conditions during the Early Cambrian.<sep>Abstract Earth’s atmosphere experienced a step of profound oxygenation during the Neoproterozoic era, accompanied by diversification of animals. However, during the Cryogenian period (720–635 million years ago) Earth experienced its most severe glaciations which likely impacted marine ecosystems and multicellular life in the oceans. In particular, large volumes of Mn and Fe accumulated during the interglacial intervals of the Cryogenian glaciations, indicating large anoxic marine metal reservoirs. Here we present chromium isotope-, rare earth element-, and redox-sensitive trace element data of sedimentary rocks from the interglacial Datangpo Formation deposited between the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations in South China, in an attempt to investigate the oxidation state of the oceans and atmosphere. Both the Cr isotope and trace element data indicate mainly anoxic water conditions with cryptic oxic surface water incursions after the Sturtian glaciation. Glacial-fed manganese precipitated as manganese carbonate in anoxic basins, and the non-fractionated δ 53 Cr record of −0.10 ± 0.06‰ identifies anoxic conditions with a cryptic component of slightly fractionated Cr isotope composition in manganese ore, in line with distinctly fractionated Mo isotope composition. Both the manganese carbonate ore and the black shales exhibit very low redox-sensitive element concentrations. Our study demonstrates that the oxygenation of the seawater, and inferably of the atmosphere, at the beginning of the Cryogenian interglacial interval was much subdued. The post-glacial rebound then allowed the Ediacaran biological diversity.<sep>Abstract While atmospheric oxygenation occurred largely in two major steps, the oxygenation of Earth's oceans is assumed to be more complicated, shifting repeatedly between oxic and anoxic conditions. The exact timeline and causal drivers of these changes, which seemingly culminated in the well‐ventilated oceans we see today are not well understood. This study presents Cr isotope and rare earth element + yttrium (REE + Y) data combined with V/Cr ratios for the calcareous Yanjiahe and shaley Shuijingtuo Formations from the shelf of the Yangtze Block, South China, to improve our understanding of marine redox conditions during the early Cambrian. We measured authigenic δ 53 Cr values of up to 1.38‰ for the carbonates of the Yanjiahe Formation as well as Ce anomalies as low as 0.57 suggesting deposition under oxic conditions. The Shuijingtuo Formation is characterized by authigenic δ 53 Cr values as high as 1.27‰ at its base, but shows a strong increase in detrital content upwards, masking authigenic Cr isotope values and dissolved marine REE + Y profiles. The upper Shuijingtuo Formation is characterized by V/Cr ratios as high as 27, which indicate anoxic conditions. Hence, our data support a prevalence of oxic seawater conditions in the shallow seawater of the Yangtze Block during the Ediacaran‐Cambrian transition, which shifted repeatedly to anoxic during the early Cambrian likely as a result of sea level rise and a redox‐stratified ocean.<sep>Abstract Chromium stable isotope variations in marine black shales are increasingly used to constrain redox changes though time. However, how well black shale δ 53 Cr values represent ambient seawater δ 53 Cr values is difficult to assess as black shales contain both detrital and authigenic mineral phases, of which only authigenic phases are expected to mirror seawater, while detrital silicate phases are expected to show igneous δ 53 Cr values. In order to correct for detrital contamination, it is thus imperative to know whether detrital minerals are in fact characterized by igneous δ 53 Cr values. To investigate this further, three sets of Cr (VI) batch sorption experiments were conducted, reacting kaolin with (1) with a synthetic Cr (VI) solution, (2) with Cr (VI) doped river water, and (3) with Cr (VI) doped seawater. Further, sequential leaches were applied to reacted kaolin to evaluate how well sorbed Cr (VI) can be leached. The experiments revealed that Cr (VI) readily sorbs on kaolin, changing its Cr concentration and isotopic composition. In river water, kaolin sorbed up to 36 μg of Cr (VI) per gram of kaolin and recorded a negative offset in bulk δ 53 Cr of up to 0.26‰ relative to unreacted kaolin, while no sorption was observed in seawater. Our leaching experiments revealed that already a weak acid leach (0.5M HCl) readily mobilizes some of the sorbed Cr from kaolin, which when applied to black shales will likely contaminate leachates designed to release authigenic Cr. This has major implications for the application of Cr stable isotopes in black shales as marine paleoredox archives.<sep>The evidence of prehistoric long-distance exchange networks in northern Italy is overwhelming, attested by several finds of non-local raw materials in Bronze Age pile-dwelling settlements of Lake Garda and eastern Po plain, like amber beads and bronze artefacts. Metals are dispersed throughout Bronze Age Europe from mining communities within the Alpine regions, and possibly local artefacts, like the Peschiera-type daggers, are known from archaeological records throughout Europe. This positions the region as part of organized networks of trade and communication connecting prehistoric Europe from north to south. This, however, does not in itself indicate a similar long-distance mobility of prehistoric individuals. To investigate individual, human provenance and mobility, the strontium (Sr) isotope methodology compares strontium isotope analysis of human remains to bioavailable strontium isotope baselines characterizing the regions of interest. We present here environmentally based, multi-proxy (water, soil leachates and plants) Sr baselines from the Lake Garda region. Our results show two separate baselines, roughly corresponding to the geographical distribution of rock types and erosional products thereof. One baseline is valid for the Lake Garda region, where Mesozoic carbonates are a dominant surface-near strontium source, and for the central Po plain north of River Po. We constrain this to 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7088 ± 0.0014 (2σ; n = 44) when including 9 compatible samples reported previously. The second Sr-baseline is valid for Alpine areas dominated by magmatic (basalts excluded) and metamorphic bedrock around the Fersina valley. We constrain this to 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7146 ± 0.0058 (2σ; n = 22) when including 11 compatible samples reported in previous studies. The baselines are compatible with previously reported results of other Sr proxies such as snails, archaeological fauna, and agricultural soils and products from the region.<sep>Sr isotopes are a powerful tool used to reconstruct human mobility in archaeology. This requires extensive bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr baselines used as reference for deciphering potential areas of origin. We define the first extensive bioavailable Sr isotope baselines for the different geographical regions and surface lithologies of Greece by combining new Sr data with previously published bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data. We present 82 new Sr concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr signatures of plants, soil leachates, surface waters and spring waters from Central Greece and combine these with published baseline values from all over Greece. We define individual baselines for ten of the thirteen geographical regions of Greece. We also provide soil leachate 87Sr/86Sr ratios from the two archaeological Bronze Age sites of Kirrha and Ayios Vasileios in Central and Southern Greece and demonstrate the validity and applicability of the new baselines for these sites. The bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr compositions of Central Greece define a narrow range of 87Sr/86Sr values between 0.70768 — 0.71021, with the widest range observed for the soil leachates. Sr derived from carbonate weathering appears to be the most important Sr source sampled by the proxies. There is an overall larger variability in baseline ranges of the different geographical regions, the narrowest is that for West Greece and the widest that for West Macedonia. In addition, we computed statistical Sr isotope ranges for the five main surface lithological groups characterising the sampling sites of the various proxies. Narrowly ranged, unradiogenic bioavailable Sr isotope signatures are typical of areas characterised by igneous outcrops as well as by Cenozoic and Mesozoic sediments. Areas, where Palaeozoic and Precambrian bedrock outcrops dominate, produce significantly wider ranges. Our study promotes the usefulness of multi-proxy baselines for geographical reference purposes and thus their promising applicability for future human mobility studies.<sep>Strontium (Sr) isotope based provenance and migration studies of ancient humans and animals necessitate representative isoscapes/baselines. However, regions/terranes that were shaped and affected by glaciers during the last Ice Age and are covered by glaciogenic sediments present a challenge with regards to the choice of suitable surface proxy archives. Recent studies proposed that only 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures from “pristine” areas are relevant for this purpose.To test this theory, we present 160 new Sr concentrations [Sr] and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures composed from ~960 subsamples of soil leachates and plants, complemented with 55 surface waters from agriculturally unaffected “pristine” forest sites from all over Denmark (island of Bornholm excluded). Average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures of all three proxies (plants: 0.71151±0.00248; 2σ, n=162; soil leachates: 0.71182±0.00366; 2σ; n=161, surface waters: 0.71042±0.00303; 2σ, n=55) are elevated compared to larger water bodies (rivers, creeks, lakes) in Denmark. In mixing diagrams, the data arrays converge in a shared high [Sr] low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr endmember, which points to either remnant natural carbonates and/or organic components retaining carbonate Sr in the studied Podzols/Luvisols. The indications for more abundant carbonates in the past, compared to today’s acid leached soils, implies that 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values measured from “pristine” forest locations and heathlands do not adequately reflect the biosphere compositions that prevailed thousands of years ago. Consequently, “pristine” forests seem to be unsuitable proxy archive environments for constructing Sr isotope baselines for proveniencing of ancient humans and animals. Hence, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values measured in these “pristine” areas are non-representative and inadequate, and their use will lead to wrong interpretations.Finally, our study sheds light on the complexity of defining relevant and representative isoscapes/baselines in areas where the surface biosphere conditions do not necessary reflect the underlying geology.<sep>Strontium (Sr) isotope based provenance and mobility studies of ancient humans and animals necessitate representative isoscapes/baselines.

Consequently, pristine forests in Denmark seem to be unsuitable proxy archive environments for constructing Sr isotope baselines for determining the provenance and mobility of ancient humans and animals. Hence, 87Sr/86Sr values measured in these pristine areas are non-representative and inadequate, and their use will lead to wrong interpretations. Finally, our study sheds light on the complexity of defining relevant and representative isoscapes/baselines in significantly changing environments and areas where the surface biosphere conditions do not necessary reflect the underlying geology.<sep>Sr isotopes are a powerful tool used for provenancing in many disciplines, but their successful application requires the availability of robust Sr baselines of potential target areas. This study presents 87Sr/86Sr signatures and Sr concentrations of water, plants and soil leachates from the Peloponnese peninsula, Greece, to establish the first comprehensive bioavailable Sr isotope baseline for this region. Additionally, this study aims to evaluate which proxy is most suitable to characterise bioavailable Sr in a geologically complex area also exposed to foreign aeolian Sr sources. Our recorded bioavailable Sr isotope signatures correspond well with the surface lithologies characteristic of the Peloponnese. Unradiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratios and a narrow isotope range (0.70779–0.70955) characterise the bioavailable Sr signatures of the sedimentary deposits and more radiogenic and isotopically variable values (0.70791–0.72370) were measured for metamorphic and igneous rock outcrops. The differences in 87Sr/86Sr values measured between proxies of one site are comparatively low for samples from the sedimentary and igneous deposits, while the overall spread in 87Sr/86Sr values is wider for samples from metamorphic deposits. We propose to define bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr baseline ranges as the average bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratio of all proxies of each lithology ± its double standard deviation (x̅ ± 2σ). This results in narrow baselines for the sedimentary outcrops of 0.70832 ± 0.00053 (n = 58) for clastic sediments and 0.70835 ± 0.00089 (n = 29) for chemical sediments. The metamorphic deposits are characterised by wider bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr baselines of 0.70906 ± 0.00116 (n = 4) and 0.71429 ± 0.01133 (n = 13) for marble and schist, respectively. The bioavailable Sr baseline for igneous rock outcrops is also characterised by a comparatively wide range with 0.70950 ± 0.00259 (n = 7). The wide range in inter- and intra-site specific bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr variation observed in this study emphasise the need for comprehensive multi-proxy sampling strategies within geologically-complex areas.<sep>The Spanish region of Almería is well known for its rich geological records and its richness in archaeological remains. Sr isotopes have been applied in archaeology as a powerful tracing tool for individual human and animal mobility, but their application requires extensive regional baselines as reference against which the target materials can be compared. This study presents Sr concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr values of modern environmental proxies (plants, soils and surface waters) from southern Almería to establish such a bioavailable Sr isotope baseline for this region. Additionally, this study evaluates differences in bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr signatures of the plants, soil leachates and surface waters and tests three soil leaching agents, ultrapure water (mq), 1M NH4NO3 and 0.1M HNO3, to better understand variations of Sr isotope signatures captured by the different proxies and to evaluate their suitability for baseline constructions. Our results define a wide range of 87Sr/86Sr values ranging from 0.70836 to 0.71630. Our data reveals a strong influence of the local surface lithology on bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr compositions. While the plants and soil leachates generally returned similar 87Sr/86Sr values, surface waters from the same sites sometimes returned significantly less radiogenic values likely due to transported, carbonate-derived Sr from their catchment areas. The different soil leaching procedures returned leachable fractions with similar 87Sr/86Sr values, but a slight bias was observed for soils with a carbonate component signifying the overall strong control of bioavailable Sr by carbonates. We propose to define bioavailable Sr isotope baselines as the average bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratio ± double standard deviation (x̅± 2σ) of 1) plants and soil leachates and 2) surface waters for each surface lithology. The soil and plant-based baselines define the narrowest range in 87Sr/86Sr for areas dominated by Cenozoic volcanic rocks while the widest range is seen in areas dominated by high grade Paleozoic metamorphic rocks. Due to the scarcity of surface water run-off in the arid region of southern Almería, surface water based 87Sr/86Sr baselines could only be defined for sites dominated by Cenozoic sediments and high grade Paleozoic metamorphic rocks.<sep>The Hiraiso Formation of northeast Japan represents an important and under-explored archive of Early Triassic marine ecosystems. Here, we present a palaeoecological analysis of its benthic faunas in order to explore the temporal and spatial variations of diversity, ecological structure and taxonomic composition. In addition, we utilise redox proxies to make inferences about the redox state of the depositional environments. We then use this data to explore the pace of recovery in the Early Triassic, and the habitable zone hypothesis, where wave aerated marine environments are thought to represent an oxygenated refuge. The age of the Hiraiso Formation is equivocal due to the lack of key biostratigraphical index fossils, but new ammonoid finds in this study support an early Spathian age. The ichnofossils from the Hiraiso Formation show an onshore-offshore trend with high diversity and relatively large faunas in offshore transition settings and a low diversity of small ichnofossils in basinal settings. The body fossils do not, however, record either spatial or temporal changes, because the shell beds represent allochthonous assemblages due to wave reworking. The dominance of small burrow sizes, presence of key taxa including Thalassinoides, Rhizocorallium and Holocrinus, presence of complex trace fossils, and both erect and deep infaunal tiering organisms suggests that the benthic fauna represents an advanced stage of ecological recovery for the Early Triassic, but not full recovery. The ecological state suggests a similar level of ecological complexity to late Griesbachian and Spathian communities elsewhere, with the Spathian marking a globally important stage of recovery following the mass extinction. The onshore-offshore distribution of the benthic faunas supports the habitable zone hypothesis. This gradient is, however, also consistent with onshore-offshore ecological gradients known to be controlled by oxygen gradients in modern tropical and subtropical settings. This suggests that the habitable zone is not an oxygenated refuge that is only restricted to anoxic events. The lack of observed full recovery is likely a consequence of a persistent oxygen-limitation (dysoxic conditions), hot Early Triassic temperatures and the lack of a steep temperature/water-depth gradient within the habitable zone.<sep>Chromium (Cr) stable isotopes in marine sediments, in particular iron formations, have been used to track changes in Earth’s surface redox conditions. In recent years several studies have been published that focus on shale-hosted Cr isotopes to further constrain the evolution of atmospheric oxygen levels. As shales are composed of a mixture of detrital and authigenic components, it is critical to know which phases host Cr and to determine any variations in Cr concentration and degree of fractionation between the different host phases. Here we assess whether shales have the potential to record Cr-isotope values that are meaningful to paleoenvironmental studies, focusing on representative examples of organic-rich marine sediments (black shale, phosphate and chert samples) from the Cambrian-aged Jiumenchong and Ediacaran-aged Liuchapo Formations (South China). We use a novel approach to isolate authigenic components which potentially record primary marine redox-fluctuations. Bulk sediment digests and sequential leaches (0.5 M HCL, 6 M HCl, HF and aqua regia), combined with X-ray diffraction and microbeam mineral mapping (Nanomin) characterisation of unreacted and leached sediment samples, allow us to identify potential Cr-hosting phases and their isotopic signatures. The black shale bulk sediment δ53Cr values vary between 0.02‰ ± 0.15‰ and 0.56‰ ± 0.10‰ and are thus slightly positively fractioned compared to the igneous Earth signature of −0.124 ± 0.101‰. The highest δ53Cr value was measured for a chert sample (0.98‰ ± 0.13‰). The leaching test results reveal that the majority of Cr (75–85%) is hosted in the silicate mineral fraction of the sediment, and is liberated during the 6 M HCl and HF acid leaching steps. Further, carbonates/phosphates and pyrite could be isolated as potential Cr hosts by our sequential leaching approach (liberated by the 0.5 M HCl and aqua regia leaching steps respectively). The δ53Cr values of each sequential leach step were generally within error of their respective bulk δ53Cr value. This is surprising as Cr derived from detrital phases is expected to have a different δ53Cr value from Cr in authigenic phases, which are thought to record δ53Cr of Cr in the water column, and suggests that the δ53Cr value of detrital minerals might deviate from the narrow range of values documented for igneous rocks. The similar δ53Cr values observed for the authigenic and detrital mineral phases suggest whole-rock diagenetic homogenisation, which complicates the application and interpretation of Cr stable isotopes in organic-rich black shales for paleoredox conditions.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Groundwater<sep>Submarine groundwater discharge<sep>Water column<sep>Trace element<sep>Seawater<sep>Sea ice<sep>Polar<sep>Structural basin<sep>Canada Basin<sep>Lead (geology)<sep>Particulates<sep>Arctic<sep>Isotope<sep>Scavenging<sep>The arctic<sep>Buoy<sep>Estuary<sep>Biogeochemistry<sep>Geotraces<sep>Current (fluid)<sep>Rare-earth element<sep>Dissolved organic carbon<sep>Hydrography</keyword><title>Separating individual contributions of major Siberian rivers in the Transpolar Drift of the Arctic Ocean<sep>Surface water changes during transit from North Pole to Fram Strait<sep>Decrease in &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;230&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Th in the Amundsen Basin since 2007: far-field effect of increased scavenging on the shelf?<sep>Circulation changes in the Amundsen Basin from 1991 to 2015 revealed from distributions of dissolved &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;230&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Th<sep>Seawater‐Particle Interactions of Rare Earth Elements and Neodymium Isotopes in the Deep Central Arctic Ocean<sep>Dissolved Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn in the Arctic Ocean<sep>The Transpolar Drift as a Source of Riverine and Shelf‐Derived Trace Elements to the Central Arctic Ocean<sep>Rare Earth Element Behavior in a Sandy Subterranean Estuary of the Southern North Sea</title><abstract>Abstract The Siberian rivers supply large amounts of freshwater and terrestrial derived material to the Arctic Ocean. Although riverine freshwater and constituents have been identified in the central Arctic Ocean, the individual contributions of the Siberian rivers to and their spatiotemporal distributions in the Transpolar Drift (TPD), the major wind-driven current in the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean, are unknown. Determining the influence of individual Siberian rivers downstream the TPD, however, is critical to forecast responses in polar and sub-polar hydrography and biogeochemistry to the anticipated individual changes in river discharge and freshwater composition. Here, we identify the contributions from the largest Siberian river systems, the Lena and Yenisei/Ob, in the TPD using dissolved neodymium isotopes and rare earth element concentrations. We further demonstrate their vertical and lateral separation that is likely due to distinct temporal emplacements of Lena and Yenisei/Ob waters in the TPD as well as prior mixing of Yenisei/Ob water with ambient waters.<sep>Ice drift recorded by ice buoys show a relatively direct pathway of ice from the North Pole to Fram Strait. An ice tethered buoy deployed in 2015 during GEOTRACES section GN04 at 89°N was recovered in August 2016 at 76°43N in Fram Strait during GEOTRACES section GN05. Does the surface water follow a similar pathway? Tracer data collected during these two expeditions are used to investigate to what extent the water in the East Greenland Current (EGC) can be considered a downstream extension of the Transpolar Drift (TPD) at the North Pole. The reduction of 228Ra activities and 129I/236U ratios in the EGC compared to the TPD can be explained either by a much longer (order 3-4 years) travel time than suggested by the ice drift, or by admixture of surface waters from other, presumably Pacific sources. The pathways followed by surface water in a coupled sea-ice-ocean model suggest that the transit of surface water is indeed much more erratic and time consuming than the transit of ice. We will discuss whether N/P ratios or Nd isotopes give evidence for a change in the contribution of Pacific waters.<sep>Abstract. This study provides dissolved and particulate 230Th and 232Th results as well as particulate 234Th data collected during expeditions to the central Arctic Ocean (GEOTRACES, an international project to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of trace elements; sections GN04 and GIPY11). Constructing a time series of dissolved 230Th from 1991 to 2015 enables the identification of processes that control the temporal development of 230Th distributions in the Amundsen Basin. After 2007, 230Th concentrations decreased significantly over the entire water column, particularly between 300 and 1500 m. This decrease is accompanied by a circulation change, evidenced by a concomitant increase in salinity. A potentially increased inflow of water of Atlantic origin with low dissolved 230Th concentrations leads to the observed depletion in dissolved 230Th in the central Arctic. Because atmospherically derived tracers (chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)) do not reveal an increase in ventilation rate, it is suggested that these interior waters have undergone enhanced scavenging of Th during transit from Fram Strait and the Barents Sea to the central Amundsen Basin. The 230Th depletion propagates downward in the water column by settling particles and reversible scavenging.<sep>Abstract. This study provides dissolved and particulate 230Th and 232Th results as well as particulate 234Th data collected during expeditions to the central Arctic Ocean on ARK-XXIX/3 (2015) and ARK-XXII/2 (2007) (GEOTRACES sections GN04 and GIPY11, respectively). Constructing a time-series of dissolved 230Th from 1991 to 2015 enables the identification of processes that control the temporal development of 230Th distributions in the Amundsen Basin. After 2007, 230Th concentrations decreased significantly over the entire water column, particularly between 300 m and 1500 m. This decrease is accompanied by a circulation change, evidenced by a concomitant increase in salinity. Potentially increased inflow of water of Atlantic origin with low dissolved 230Th concentrations leads to the observed depletion in dissolved 230Th in the central Arctic. Because atmospherically derived tracers (CFC, 3He/3H) do not reveal an increase in ventilation rate, it is suggested that these interior waters have undergone enhanced scavenging of Th during transit from the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea to the central Amundsen Basin. The 230Th depletion propagates downward in the water column by settling particles and reversible scavenging. Taken together, the temporal evolution of Th distributions point to significant changes in the large-scale circulation of the Amundsen Basin.<sep>Abstract In the central Arctic Ocean, dissolved rare earth element concentrations ([dREE]) and the neodymium (Nd) isotope compositions are constant throughout the deep water column (&gt;1,000 m water depth), indicating unique conditions among the ocean basins and therefore requiring an investigation of seawater‐particle interactions. Here, we present the first high‐resolution particulate REE and Nd isotope data from the Arctic Ocean and discuss the possible seawater‐particle processes affecting the Arctic Ocean. Our results show that particulate [REE] are on the same order of magnitude as in other ocean basins, suggesting that particle composition is the main cause for a lack of pREE release to the dissolved pool. The lithogenic fraction dominates throughout the water column while the biogenic material contribution is very small. This paucity of biogenic material results in reduced particle‐seawater exchanges of REEs and Nd isotopes. Moreover, we note only slight differences in the dissolved Nd isotope composition between the Eurasian and Canadian Basins. This is due to the different source regions supplying different dissolved and particulate Nd isotope signatures to both basins. The dissolved [REE] and Nd isotope composition of Atlantic waters are modified during their flow paths through contributions from the Kara Sea, lowering the salinity and increasing [dREE] and dNd isotope compositions. Hydrothermal influence from the Gakkel Ridge on dissolved and particulate [REE] and Nd isotopes could not be detected.<sep>Abstract During the Polarstern (PS94) expedition, summer 2015, part of the international GEOTRACES program, sources and sinks of dissolved (D) Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn were studied in the central Arctic Ocean. In the Polar Surface Water in which the TransPolar Drift (TPD) is situated, salinity and δ 18 O derived fractions indicated a distinct riverine source for silicate DCo, DCu, DFe, DMn, and DNi. Linear relationships between DMn and the meteoric fraction depended on source distance, likely due to Mn‐precipitation during transport. In the upper 50 m of the Makarov Basin, outside the TPD core, DCo, DMn, DNi, DCd, and DCu were enriched by Pacific waters, whereas DFe seemed diluted. DCo, DFe, DMn, and DZn were relatively high in the Barents Sea and led to enrichment of Atlantic water flowing into the Nansen Basin. Deep concentrations of all metals were significantly lower in the Makarov Basin compared to the Nansen and Amundsen, the Eurasian, Basins. The Gakkel ridge hydrothermal input and higher continental slope convection are explanations for higher metal concentrations in the Eurasian Basins. Although scavenging rates are lower in the Makarov Basin compared to the Eurasian Basins, the residence time is longer and therefore scavenging can decrease the dissolved concentrations with time. This study provides a baseline to assess future change, and additionally identifies processes driving trace metal distributions. Our results underline the importance of fluvial input as well as shelf sources and internal cycling, notably scavenging, for the distribution of bio‐active metals in the Arctic Ocean.<sep>Abstract A major surface circulation feature of the Arctic Ocean is the Transpolar Drift (TPD), a current that transports river‐influenced shelf water from the Laptev and East Siberian Seas toward the center of the basin and Fram Strait. In 2015, the international GEOTRACES program included a high‐resolution pan‐Arctic survey of carbon, nutrients, and a suite of trace elements and isotopes (TEIs). The cruises bisected the TPD at two locations in the central basin, which were defined by maxima in meteoric water and dissolved organic carbon concentrations that spanned 600 km horizontally and ~25–50 m vertically. Dissolved TEIs such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Hg, Nd, and Th, which are generally particle‐reactive but can be complexed by organic matter, were observed at concentrations much higher than expected for the open ocean setting. Other trace element concentrations such as Al, V, Ga, and Pb were lower than expected due to scavenging over the productive East Siberian and Laptev shelf seas. Using a combination of radionuclide tracers and ice drift modeling, the transport rate for the core of the TPD was estimated at 0.9 ± 0.4 Sv (10 6 m 3 s −1 ). This rate was used to derive the mass flux for TEIs that were enriched in the TPD, revealing the importance of lateral transport in supplying materials beneath the ice to the central Arctic Ocean and potentially to the North Atlantic Ocean via Fram Strait. Continued intensification of the Arctic hydrologic cycle and permafrost degradation will likely lead to an increase in the flux of TEIs into the Arctic Ocean.<sep>The use of rare earth elements (REEs) as tracers for oceanic processes requires knowledge and quantification of their sources and sinks. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has been suggested to be a potentially important source of REEs and other trace elements to the ocean. To investigate the processes affecting REEs in a subterranean estuary (STE) of a sandy beach system and their contribution to coastal waters of the southern North Sea, we analyzed dissolved REE concentrations in beach pore waters, coastal seawater and fresh groundwater on the barrier island Spiekeroog, German North Sea. The pore waters show variable REE concentrations (Neodymium between 6 and 54 pmol/kg), generally increasing from the upper beach to the shoreline. At the upper beach, mixing of coastal pore water with rainwater and scavenging lead to lower REE concentrations than in coastal seawater and high heavy (HREE) over light (LREE) REE ratios. Close to the low water line, the REE concentrations increase, partly exceeding seawater concentrations and showing a positive deviation from conservative mixing, with shale-normalized light and middle REE-enriched patterns. This is due to the release of light and middle REEs from degrading particulate organic material and potentially dissolution of Fe/Mn-oxides under reducing conditions. Reducing conditions are further supported by the change from a negative Ce-anomaly at the upper beach to no anomaly close to the low water line. Net SGD fluxes of both fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater are a source of light, middle and heavy REEs to the ocean, with a higher contribution of LREEs than HREEs compared to seawater. However, the total amount of REEs added to the North Sea by SGD from the East Frisian Islands is still ~500 times smaller than input from nearby rivers. An anthropogenic Gd signal higher than previously reported is present throughout the pore waters and seawater, indicating increasing accumulation of anthropogenic Gd in the coastal marine environment.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/12807220", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5027147586", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5062628352", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates a strong background in geochemical modeling and paleoclimate studies, particularly in the context of ancient Earth systems, which aligns well with the job's focus on modeling aerosol-cloud interactions through Earth history.

Methods are required that can handle forecasting under these conditions and detect outliers that would otherwise go unnoticed. The key challenge is to remove as many outliers as possible while maintaining enough clean data to use in the regression. In this paper we investigate robust approaches with data-driven tuning parameters, and in particular present an adaptive trimmed regression method that can better detect outliers and provide improved forecasts. In general, data-driven approaches perform much better than their fixed tuning parameter counterparts.

We introduce an efficient framework using Gaussian processes to discover mechanisms underlying delay, migration, and proliferation in a cell invasion experiment. Gaussian processes are leveraged with bootstrapping to provide uncertainty quantification for the mechanisms that drive the invasion process. Our framework is efficient, parallelisable, and can be applied to other biological problems. We illustrate our methods using a canonical scratch assay experiment, demonstrating how simply we can explore different functional forms and develop and test hypotheses about underlying mechanisms, such as whether delay is present.

While many exact results for MET are known for diffusion in simple geometries involving homogeneous materials, calculating MET for diffusion in realistic geometries involving heterogeneous materials is typically limited to repeated stochastic simulations or numerical solutions of the associated boundary value problem (BVP). In this work we derive exact solutions for the MET in irregular annular domains, including some applications where diffusion occurs in heterogenous media. These solutions are obtained by taking the exact results for MET in an annulus, and then constructing various perturbation solutions to account for the irregular geometries involved. These solutions, with a range of boundary conditions, are implemented symbolically and compare very well with averaged data from repeated stochastic simulations and with numerical solutions of the associated BVP.

We investigate the influence of pore geometry on tissue growth using osteoblastic cells in 3D printed melt electrowritten scaffolds with square-shaped pores and non-square pores with wave-shaped boundaries. Using a reaction–diffusion model together with a likelihood-based uncertainty quantification framework, we quantify how the cellular mechanisms of cell migration and cell proliferation drive tissue growth for each pore geometry. Our results show that the rates of cell migration and cell proliferation appear to be largely independent of the pore geometries considered, suggesting that observed curvature effects on local rates of tissue growth are due to space availability rather than directly affecting cell behaviour. This result allows for simple squared-shaped pores to be used for estimating parameters and making predictions about tissue growth in more realistic pores with more realistic, complicated shapes. Our findings have important implications for the development of predictive tools for tissue engineering and experimental design, highlighting new avenues for future research.<sep>Burgers' equation is an important mathematical model used to study gas dynamics and traffic flow, among many other applications. Previous analysis of solutions to Burgers' equation shows an infinite stream of simple poles born at t = 0^+, emerging rapidly from the singularities of the initial condition, that drive the evolution of the solution for t > 0. We build on this work by applying exponential asymptotics and transseries methodology to an ordinary differential equation that governs the small-time behaviour in order to derive asymptotic descriptions of these poles and associated zeros. Our analysis reveals that subdominant exponentials appear in the solution across Stokes curves; these exponentials become the same size as the leading order terms in the asymptotic expansion along anti-Stokes curves, which is where the poles and zeros are located. In this region of the complex plane, we write a transseries approximation consisting of nested series expansions. By reversing the summation order in a process known as transasymptotic summation, we study the solution as the exponentials grow, and approximate the pole and zero location to any required asymptotic accuracy. We present the asymptotic methods in a systematic fashion that should be applicable to other nonlinear differential equations.<sep>Mathematical modelling of biological population dynamics often involves proposing high-fidelity discrete agent-based models that capture stochasticity and individual-level processes. These models are often considered in conjunction with an approximate coarse-grained differential equation that captures population-level features only. These coarse-grained models are only accurate in certain asymptotic parameter regimes, such as enforcing that the time scale of individual motility far exceeds the time scale of birth/death processes. When these coarse-grained models are accurate, the discrete model still abides by conservation laws at the microscopic level, which implies that there is some macroscopic conservation law that can describe the macroscopic dynamics. In this work, we introduce an equation learning framework to find accurate coarse-grained models when standard continuum limit approaches are inaccurate. We demonstrate our approach using a discrete mechanical model of epithelial tissues, considering a series of four case studies that consider problems with and without free boundaries, and with and without proliferation, illustrating how we can learn macroscopic equations describing mechanical relaxation, cell proliferation, and the equation governing the dynamics of the free boundary of the tissue. While our presentation focuses on this biological application, our approach is more broadly applicable across a range of scenarios where discrete models are approximated by approximate continuum-limit descriptions.<sep>Burgers’ equation is an important mathematical model used to study gas dynamics and traffic flow, among many other applications.

As such, calculations of the distribution of first passage time, and in particular the mean first passage time, is an active area of research relevant to many disciplines. Exact results for the mean first passage time for diffusion on simple geometries, such as lines, discs and spheres, are well-known. In contrast, computational methods are often used to study the first passage time for diffusion on more realistic geometries where closed-form solutions of the governing elliptic boundary value problem are not available. Here, we develop a perturbation solution to calculate the mean first passage time on irregular domains formed by perturbing the boundary of a disc or an ellipse. Classical perturbation expansion solutions are then constructed using the exact solutions available on a disc and an ellipse. We apply the perturbation solutions to compute the mean first exit time on two naturally-occurring irregular domains: a map of Tasmania, an island state of Australia, and a map of Taiwan. Comparing the perturbation solutions with numerical solutions of the elliptic boundary value problem on these irregular domains confirms that we obtain a very accurate solution with a few terms in the series only. MATLAB software to implement all calculations is available at https://github.com/ProfMJSimpson/Exit_time .<sep>Burgers' equation is a well-studied model in applied mathematics with connections to the Navier-Stokes equations in one spatial direction and traffic flow, for example. Following on from previous work, we analyse solutions to Burgers' equation in the complex plane, concentrating on the dynamics of the complex singularities and their relationship to the solution on the real line. For an initial condition with a simple pole in each of the upper- and lower-half planes, we apply formal asymptotics in the small- and large-time limits in order to characterise the initial and later motion of the singularities. The small-time limit highlights how infinitely many singularities are born at $t=0$ and how they orientate themselves to lie increasingly close to anti-Stokes lines in the far-field of the inner problem. This inner problem also reveals whether or not the closest singularity to the real axis moves toward the axis or away. For intermediate times, we use the exact solution, apply method of steepest descents, and implement the AAA approximation to track the complex singularities. Connections are made between the motion of the closest singularity to the real axis and the steepness of the solution on the real line. While Burgers' equation has an exact solution, we deliberately apply a mix of techniques in our analysis in an attempt to develop methodology that can be applied to other nonlinear partial differential equations that do not.<sep>Burgers’ equation is a well-studied model in applied mathematics with connections to the Navier–Stokes equations in one spatial direction and traffic flow, for example.

This inner problem also reveals whether or not the closest singularity to the real axis moves toward the axis or away. For intermediate times, we use the exact solution, apply method of steepest descents, and implement the AAA approximation to track the complex singularities. Connections are made between the motion of the closest singularity to the real axis and the steepness of the solution on the real line. While Burgers’ equation is integrable (and has an exact solution), we deliberately apply a mix of techniques in our analysis in an attempt to develop methodology that can be applied to other nonlinear partial differential equations that do not.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Buoyancy<sep>Invariant (physics)<sep>Shallow water equations<sep>Discontinuous Galerkin method<sep>Conservation of energy<sep>Polygon mesh<sep>Euler equations<sep>Curvilinear coordinates<sep>Turbulence<sep>Energy conservation<sep>Entropy (arrow of time)<sep>Conservation of mass<sep>Conservation law<sep>Finite element method</keyword><title>An entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin method for the spherical\n  thermal shallow water equations<sep>Conservation and stability in a discontinuous Galerkin method for the\n  vector invariant spherical shallow water equations<sep>Conservation and stability in a discontinuous Galerkin method for the vector invariant spherical shallow water equations<sep>Entropy and energy conservation for thermal atmospheric dynamics using mixed compatible finite elements<sep>Entropy and energy conservation for thermal atmospheric dynamics using\n  mixed compatible finite elements</title><abstract>We develop a novel discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the rotating thermal shallow water equations (TRSW) on a curvilinear mesh. Our method is provably entropy stable, conserves mass, buoyancy and vorticity, while also semi-discretely conserving energy. This is achieved by using novel numerical fluxes and splitting the pressure and convection operators. We implement our method on a cubed sphere mesh and numerically verify our theoretical results. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness of the method for a regime of well developed turbulence, where it can be run stably without any dissipation. The entropy stable fluxes are sufficient to control the grid scale noise generated by geostrophic turbulence, eliminating the need for artificial stabilization.<sep>We develop a novel and efficient discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DG-SEM) for the spherical rotating shallow water equations in vector invariant form.

While energy conservation can be enforced via the preservation of the skew-symmetric structure of the Hamiltonian form of the equations of motion, entropy conservation is typically derived as an additional invariant of the Hamiltonian system, and satisfied via the exact preservation of the chain rule. This is particularly challenging since the function spaces used to represent the thermodynamic variables in compatible finite element discretisations are typically discontinuous at element boundaries. In the present work we negate this problem by constructing our equations of motion via a novel formulation which allow for the necessary cancellations required to simultaneously conserve entropy and energy without the chain rule. We show that such formulations allow for stable simulation of turbulent dynamics for both the thermal shallow water and 3D compressible Euler equations on the sphere using mixed compatible finite elements without entropy damping.<sep>Atmospheric systems incorporating thermal dynamics must be stable with respect to both energy and entropy.

Lung tissue is composed of a variety of cell populations, including parenchymal and immune cells. Emerging evidence has revealed that multiple cell populations in the lung work in concert to regulate lung inflammation in response to both direct and indirect stimulations. To date, the question of how different types of pulmonary cells communicate with each other and subsequently regulate or modulate inflammatory cascades remains to be fully addressed. In this review, we provide an overview of current advancements in understanding the role of cell–cell interaction in the development of ALI and depict molecular mechanisms by which cell–cell interactions regulate lung inflammation, focusing on inter-cellular activities and signaling pathways that point to possible therapeutic opportunities for ALI/ARDS.<sep>Abstract The purpose of this systematic review was to identify outdoor environmental risk factors associated with falls and/or fear of falling among older adults. PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched through February 19, 2021. Studies were included if they measured outdoor environment, falls or fear of falling as an outcome, and included adults aged ≥ 45 years. Excluded studies were not published in English and/or did not include original results. Two study-team members completed abstract screening. For full text reviews, a third reviewer resolved conflicts. A total of 5,727 abstracts were screened and 462 full texts were reviewed. After full-text review, approximately 25 studies will be assessed for risk of bias and data extracted by two independent reviewers. Based on the initial review, uneven outdoor surfaces, busy traffic areas, and neighborhood disorder were associated with falls/fear of falling among older adults. Modifiable outdoor environmental factors may be targets for fall prevention.<sep>Abstract Inequities in dementia care require an in depth understanding of dementia care partner life experiences, care needs, sources of support and ways to improve those experiences at the community level. In partnership with Black Churches in Baltimore, MD and rural Pennsylvania, we facilitated three focus groups (n=30) with Black dementia care partners to understand: 1) unique dementia care-related needs and challenges, and 2) how the church can be a supportive care partner. Participants noted three overarching themes related to challenges and needs: 1) unique challenges in caregiving - assuming various roles to provide comprehensive care, working within policies of support services, environmental challenges (neighborhood safety), and family conflicts; 2) lack of dementia education and educational materials; and 3) unmet needs of the care recipient – lack of dementia friendly neighborhoods, lack of meaningful activities, and undiagnosed dementia. Regarding the supportive role of the church, the theme of perceived role of the church included providing emotional and social support for care partners and recipients, reducing burden through providing respite, support groups, networking/ connections to resources, and promoting health events.<sep>Cell necroptosis, a form of regulated inflammatory cell death, is one of the mechanisms that controls cell release of inflammatory mediators from innate immune cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), and critically regulates the progress of inflammation. Cell necroptosis features receptor-interacting protein (RIPK) 1 activation and necroptosome formation. This leads to loss of plasma membrane integrity, the release of cell contents into the extracellular space, and subsequent increased inflammation. Here, we report an intra-PMN mechanism of negative regulation of necroptosis mediated through TBK1/IKKε. Using an in vivo mouse model of intratracheal injection (i.t.) of LPS and in vitro LPS stimulation of mouse PMN, we found that LPS-TLR4 signaling in PMNs activates and phosphorylates TBK1 and IKKε, which in turn suppress LPS-induced formation of the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL (necrosome) complex. TBK1 dysfunction by knockdown or inhibitor significantly increases the phosphorylation of RIPK1 (∼67%), RIPK3 (∼68%), and MLKL (∼50%) and promotes RIPK1-RIPK3 and RIPK3-MLKL interactions and increases PMN necroptosis (∼83%) in response to LPS, with subsequent augmented lung inflammation. These findings suggest that the LPS-TLR4-TBK1 axis serves as a negative regulator for PMN necroptosis and might be a therapeutic target for modulating PMN death and inflammation.<sep>Skeletal muscle dynamically regulates systemic nutrient homeostasis through transcriptional adaptations to physiological cues. In response to changes in the metabolic environment (e.g., alterations in circulating glucose or lipid levels), networks of transcription factors and coregulators are recruited to specific genomic loci to fine-tune homeostatic gene regulation. Elucidating these mechanisms is of particular interest as these gene regulatory pathways can serve as potential targets to treat metabolic disease. The zinc-finger transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is a critical regulator of metabolic homeostasis; however, its genome-wide distribution in skeletal muscle has not been previously identified. Here, we characterize the KLF15 cistrome in vivo in skeletal muscle and find that the majority of KLF15 binding is localized to distal intergenic regions and associated with genes related to circadian rhythmicity and lipid metabolism. We also identify critical interdependence between KLF15 and the nuclear receptor PPARδ in the regulation of lipid metabolic gene programs. We further demonstrate that KLF15 and PPARδ colocalize genome-wide, physically interact, and are dependent on one another to exert their transcriptional effects on target genes. These findings reveal that skeletal muscle KLF15 plays a critical role in metabolic adaptation through its direct actions on target genes and interactions with other nodal transcription factors such as PPARδ.<sep>Abstract Background: Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 vaccination rates are subpar across the US, especially in racial and/or socioeconomic minority groups who are understudied in public health literature. The objective of this study was to elucidate the attitudes of Turtle Creek patients towards flu and COVID-19 vaccines, with the goal of establishing targetable vaccine education gaps and ultimately increasing vaccine uptake in the community. Methods: This study was conducted as a retrospective cross-sectional analysis. Authors completed 123 patient phone surveys of patients cared for at the Turtle Creek Primary Care Center inquiring about flu and COVID-19 infection status and vaccination uptake (August 26 - October 10, 2021). Results: Our data revealed a significant association between COVID-19 and flu vaccine acceptance. Additionally, we found a strong association between vaccine acceptance and age, with older patients being more likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we assessed how flu and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was affected by informational sources participants trusted most. In the COVID-19 models, those who cited “trusting medical professionals” had higher odds of vaccine acceptance while participants who cited “trusting social media” had significantly decreased odds of vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Our study revealed significant trends for flu and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance by sociodemographic factors and trust in the medical system. Using these data, we can create future interventions to overcome vaccine hesitancy.<sep>Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 vaccination rates are subpar across the US, especially in racial and/or socioeconomic minority groups who are understudied in public health literature.The objective of this mixed-methods study was to elucidate attitudes of patients at the Turtle Creek Primary Care Center, a clinic that cares for ∼70% non-white patients, towards flu and COVID-19 vaccines, with the goal of establishing vaccine education gaps and increasing vaccine uptake in minority communities.This study was conducted as a cross-sectional analysis. Authors completed 123 patient phone surveys of patients cared for at the Turtle Creek clinic inquiring about flu and COVID-19 infection status and vaccination uptake (August 26-October 10, 2021).We found that rates of vaccination were subpar in the Turtle Creek community, with only 54% having received the COVID-19 vaccine and only 44% receiving the flu vaccine regularly. There was a strong association between COVID-19 and flu vaccine acceptance and a notable correlation between vaccine acceptance and age. When assessing how vaccine acceptance was influenced by trusted sources of information, those who cited trusting \"medical professionals\" and \"word of mouth\" had higher odds of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance but those who cited trusting \"social media\" had decreased odds of acceptance. Finally, we uncovered 14 common factors for either vaccine acceptance or refusal that clustered into four overarching themes of trust, need, safety, and availability.These data highlight the necessity of improved vaccine education and reveal targetable populations and approaches for disseminating vaccine information.<sep>Abstract Neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES), an overall marker of neighborhood condition, may influence multiple aspects of health and well-being in older adulthood, including cognitive function, though results regarding neighborhood and cognition have been largely cross-sectional. We examined the association between NSES and changes in cognitive function using 610 participants from the Pittsburgh site of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study, a longitudinal cohort of community-dwelling, Black and white adults aged 70 and older. Changes in cognitive function were measured annually over a 6-year follow-up (2006-2012) using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (range: 0-100, 3 visits on average per person). Using baseline home address, NSES was calculated for census tracts by summing z-scores of six 2010 census variables representing wealth/income, education, and occupation, and divided into tertiles. Multivariate mixed-effect linear regression models assessed associations, adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic and health-related covariates. In the fully adjusted model, the lowest NSES tertile (vs. the highest) was not associated with baseline cognitive function (β: -0.99, 95% CI: -3.86, 1.87) but was associated with a faster rate of decline in cognitive function (β: -1.54, 95% CI: -2.67, -0.41). No significant differences in baseline cognitive function or rates of change were observed in the middle (vs. the highest) NSES tertile. There was no evidence of effect modification by race. The results indicate that exposure to adverse neighborhood socioeconomic environments may accelerate cognitive decline in late life. The findings add to existing literature concerning the role of environments in the context of aging.<sep>Abstract Neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are well-validated in White populations. However, it remains unclear how these biomarkers are associated with cognition in non-White populations disproportionately affected by systemic socioeconomic discrimination. We investigated whether neighborhood disadvantage modifies associations of neuroimaging biomarkers with cognition in a diverse cohort of 198 adults ≥50 years, 50% of whom are Black. Outcomes included cognitive impairment and neuropsychological test scores. Predictors were indices of neurodegeneration, vascular damage, and brain amyloid burden, quantified using MR-based measures of cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and [11C]PiB PET, respectively. We measured neighborhood disadvantage using area deprivation index (ADI), a composite measurement of socioeconomic conditions in a census tract. In linear models, higher ADI, neurodegeneration, and WMH were separately associated with worse cognition. We found an ADI*neurodegeneration interaction on delayed recall memory (p=0.08). Neurodegeneration-positive participants had worse story delayed recall compared to neurodegeneration-negative regardless of ADI (β=-1.57, p=0.01). In neurodegeneration-negative participants, higher ADI is associated with worse delayed recall (β=-0.04, p=0.004): those with a high ADI exhibited low delayed recall, comparable to neurodegeneration-positive participants. ADI was not associated with cognition in neurodegeneration-positive participants. WMH and ADI interacted in models of impairment, visual memory, and visual copy (interaction p’s&amp;lt; 0.10). In those with high ADI, greater WMH was associated with worse cognition (β=-0.30, p=0.02) while participants with low ADI scored well regardless of WMH volume. Taken together, the relationship between neuroimaging biomarkers and cognition differs by neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, highlighting the need for clinical strategies that acknowledge structural disadvantage.<sep>Abstract Exposure to discrimination has been associated with poorer cognitive function but this association may be influenced by broader social factors, such as neighborhood social cohesion. We investigated the associations between unfair treatment, social cohesion, and cognitive function in 234 participants ≥50 years, recruited from urban, primarily Black neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted in 2018 to create six cognitive domain z-scores, adjusted for age, sex, and education level. Social cohesion was assessed in 2013 and 2018. Change in social cohesion scores over time categorized participants into four groups: consistently high, consistently low, increasing, and decreasing scores. Unfair treatment was assessed via questionnaire in 2018. Adjusted generalized linear models assessed associations between unfair treatment and cognition. Unfair treatment was significantly associated with executive function (β=-0.041, p=0.01) and marginally associated with language (β=-0.030, p=0.07). Associations persisted with change in social cohesion in the models and we found that social cohesion moderated the association between unfair treatment and executive function (p=.06). In those with consistently low social cohesion, more unfair treatment was associated with worse executive function (β=-0.085, p=0.02). Both increasing and decreasing social cohesion showed a similar negative association between unfair treatment and executive function at a trend level (β=-0.122, p=0.08 and β=-0.082, p=0.10 respectively). There was no association for those with consistently high social cohesion. Individuals experiencing unfair treatment and consistently low levels of neighborhood social cohesion had lower executive function. These findings highlight the importance of intervening at multiple levels and addressing both interpersonal discrimination and structural sources.<sep>Mobility is important for independence in older age. While brain health correlates of objectively measured mobility-related features like gait and balance have been reported, we aimed to test neuroimaging and cognitive correlates of subjective measures of mobility-related confidence. We carried out a cross-sectional observational study comprised of N = 29 cognitively unimpaired older adult participants, mean age 75.8 ± 5.8, 52% female, 24% non-white. We measured cognition, hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities, cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ), and gait and balance confidence. We tested associations using unadjusted Spearman correlations and correlations partialling out covariates of interest one at a time. Greater gait confidence was associated with better attention (unadjusted ρ = 0.37, p = 0.05; partially attenuated by adjustment for age, APOE4, anxiety, motivation, gait speed, or Aβ); executive performance (unadjusted ρ = 0.35, p = 0.06; partially attenuated by adjustment for age, APOE4, gait speed, or Aβ); and lower Aβ levels (unadjusted ρ = −0.40, p = 0.04; partially attenuated by adjustment for age, depressive symptoms, motivation, or gait speed). Greater balance confidence was associated with better global cognition (unadjusted ρ = 0.41, p = 0.03; partially attenuated by adjustment for APOE4, gait speed, or Aβ); attention (unadjusted ρ = 0.46, p = 0.01; robust to adjustment); and lower Aβ levels (unadjusted ρ = −0.35, p = 0.07; partially attenuated by adjustment for age, education, APOE4, depressive symptoms, anxiety, motivation, or gait speed). Self-reported mobility-related confidence is associated with neuroimaging and cognitive measures and would be easy for providers to use in clinical evaluations. These associations should be further evaluated in larger samples, and longitudinal studies can help determine temporality of declines.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Lymphoblastic

(B-ALL), with complete remission rates in key pivotal CD19-CART trials ranging from 65% to 90%. Alongside this new therapy, new toxicity profiles and treatment limitations have emerged, necessitating toxicity consensus grading systems, cooperative group trials, and novel management approaches. This review highlights the results of key clinical trials of CART for pediatric hematologic malignancies, discusses the most common toxicities seen to date, and elucidates challenges, opportunities, and areas of active research to optimize this therapy.<sep>CAR T-cell–therapy represents a promising therapeutic option in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. However, despite encouraging remission induction rates, approximately half of patients are relapsing within a year post-CAR T-cell therapy with either antigen-negative escape or antigen-positive relapse. In this chapter, we will summarize the strategies being used to optimize CAR T-cell response to prevent or treat relapse, including strategies to bolster CAR T persistence and development of multitargeted CAR T-cells to reduce the frequency of antigen-negative relapses. Finally, the data on the role of consolidative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to prevent relapse following CAR T-cell–induced remission will be reviewed.<sep>Abstract Serious bacterial infections (SBI) can lead to devastating complications with CD19 CAR T cells and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Little is known about consequences of and risk factors for SBI with novel CAR T‐cell constructs or with CRS complicated by HLH‐like toxicities. We report on three patients with B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with CD22 CAR T cells who developed SBI and CRS‐associated HLH. Serum cytokine profiling revealed sustained elevations well beyond CRS resolution, suggesting ongoing systemic inflammation. Heightened inflammatory states converging with SBI contribute to poor outcomes, and recognition and prevention of extended inflammation may be needed to improve outcomes.<sep>Abstract Immune‐effector cell‐associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a significant toxicity occurring with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy, with first‐line treatment options including supportive care and systemic corticosteroids. Sparse data exist on how to approach progressive/refractory cases of ICANS. We present five pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had progressively worsening ICANS despite systemic steroids, and received intrathecal hydrocortisone with rapid reversal of ICANS. Therapeutic lumbar punctures are routinely used in upfront ALL therapy in pediatrics, with a demonstrable safety profile, thus use of intrathecal hydrocortisone merits further prospective studies in patients with severe ICANS.<sep>Abstract Invasive fusariosis (IF) most commonly occurs in patients with hematologic malignancies and severe neutropenia, particularly during concomitant corticosteroid use. Breakthrough infections can occur in high‐risk patients despite Aspergillus ‐active antifungal prophylaxis. We describe a patient with rapid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) progression who presented with multifocal skin nodules thought to be choloromatous disease. These lesions were ultimately diagnosed as IF and the patient had two simultaneously active disease processes. This case highlights the importance of pathologic diagnosis of new skin lesions in ALL patients, even during leukemia progression, and demonstrates that IF can occur despite normal neutrophil counts and Aspergillus ‐active prophylaxis.<sep>BK virus (BKV)-hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a well-known and rarely fatal complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Treatment for BKV-HC is limited, but virus-specific T-cells (VST) represent a promising therapeutic option feasible for use posttransplant. We report on the case of a 16-year-old male with dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency who underwent haploidentical HSCT complicated by severe BKV-HC, catastrophic renal hemorrhage, and VST-associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Gross hematuria refractory to multiple interventions began with initiation of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT/Cy). Complete left renal arterial embolization (day +43) was ultimately indicated to control intractable renal hemorrhage. Subsequent infusion of anti-BK VSTs was complicated by CRS<sep>Targeted immunotherapeutic approaches have become an attractive, novel therapy in the treatment of chemotherapy resistant or relapsed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Many of these therapies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE) in particular, rely on surface expression of the antigen for activity and efficacy. As such, antigen loss is a growing problem in this relapsed population. We present a case of relapsed, refractory B-ALL that has immunophenotypic variability in the leukemia blasts in response to the sequential targeted immunotherapies received. This case additionally describes a bolstered CAR-T cell expansion after the patient received subsequent blinatumomab therapy, suggesting a potential strategy<sep>Immunotherapeutic strategies targeting B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) effectively induce remission; however, disease recurrence remains a challenge. Due to the potential for antigen loss, antigen diminution, lineage switch or development of a secondary or treatment-related malignancy, the phenotype and manifestation of subsequent leukemia may be elusive. We report on two patients with multiply relapsed/refractory B-ALL who, following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, developed myeloid malignancies. In the first case, a myeloid sarcoma developed in a patient with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome. In the second case, two distinct events occurred. The first event represented a donor-derived myelodysplastic syndrome with monosomy 7 in a patient with a<sep>Novel immunotherapies are increasingly being employed in pediatric oncology, both in the upfront and relapsed/refractory settings. Through various mechanisms of action, engagement and activation of the immune system can cause both generalized and disease site-specific inflammation, leading to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). One of the most worrisome irAEs is that of neurotoxicity. This can present as a large spectrum of neurological toxicities, including confusion, aphasia, neuropathies, seizures, and/or death, with variable onset and severity. Earlier identification and treatment, generally with corticosteroids, remains the mainstay of neurotoxicity management to optimize patient outcomes. The pathophysiology of neurotoxicity varies across the different therapeutic strategies and remains to be elucidated<sep>Cryopreservation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells facilitates shipment, timing of infusions, and storage of subsequent doses. However, reports on the impact of cryopreservation on CAR T cell efficacy have been mixed. We retrospectively compared clinical outcomes between patients who received cryopreserved versus fresh CAR T cells for treatment of B cell leukemia across two cohorts of pediatric and young adult patients: those who received anti-CD22 CAR T cells and those who received bispecific anti-CD19/22 CAR T cells. Manufacturing methods were consistent within each trial but differed between the two trials, allowing for exploration of cryopreservation within different manufacturing platforms. Among 40 patients who received<sep>As clinical advances with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are increasingly described and the potential for extending their therapeutic benefit grows, optimizing the implementation of this therapeutic modality is imperative. The recognition and management of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) marked a milestone in this field; however, beyond the understanding gained in treating CRS, a host of additional toxicities and/or potential late effects of CAR T cell therapy warrant further investigation. A multicentre initiative involving experts in paediatric cell therapy, supportive care and/or study of late effects from cancer and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation was convened to facilitate the comprehensive study of extended CAR T cell-mediated<sep>Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection because of their suppressed immunity. The available data show that COVID-19 vaccines are less effective in SOT recipients. We aimed to assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity with an increasing the number of doses of COVID-19 vaccines in SOT recipients and to identify factors affecting vaccine response in this population. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to identify ongoing and completed studies of humoral and cellular immunity following COVID-19 vaccines in SOT recipients. The search retrieved 278 results with 45 duplicates, and 43 records did not match the inclusion criteria. After title and<sep>Late-onset inflammatory toxicities resembling hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) occur after chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T cell) infusion and represent a therapeutic challenge. Given the established link between perforin deficiency and primary HLH, we investigated the role of perforin in anti-CD19 CAR T cell efficacy and HLH-like toxicities in a syngeneic murine model. Perforin contributed to both CD8+ and CD4+ CAR T cell cytotoxicity but was not required for in vitro or in vivo leukemia clearance. Upon CAR-mediated in vitro activation, perforin-deficient CAR T cells produced higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines compared with WT CAR T cells. Following in vivo clearance<sep>Accurate disease detection is integral to risk stratification in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The gold standard used to evaluate response in the United States includes morphologic evaluation and minimal residual disease (MRD) testing of aspirated bone marrow (BM) by flow cytometry (FC). This MRD assessment is usually made on a single aspirate sample that is subject to variability in collection techniques and sampling error. Additionally, central nervous system (CNS) assessments for ALL include evaluations of cytopathology and cell counts, which can miss subclinical involvement.We retrospectively compared BM biopsy, aspirate, and FC samples obtained from children and young adults with relapsed/refractory ALL to identify the frequency<sep>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell toxicities resembling hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) occur in a subset of patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS). As a variant of conventional CRS, a comprehensive characterization of CAR T-cell-associated HLH (carHLH) and investigations into associated risk factors are lacking. In the context of 59 patients infused with CD22 CAR T cells where a substantial proportion developed carHLH, we comprehensively describe the manifestations and timing of carHLH as a CRS variant and explore factors associated with this clinical profile. Among 52 subjects with CRS, 21 (40.4%) developed carHLH. Clinical features of carHLH included hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, coagulopathy, hepatic transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, severe neutropenia, elevated<sep>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a revolutionary cancer treatment modality, particularly in children and young adults with B cell malignancies. Through clinical trials and real-world experience, much has been learned about the unique toxicity profile of CAR-T therapy. The past decade brought advances in identifying risk factors for severe inflammatory toxicities, investigating preventive measures to mitigate these toxicities, and exploring novel strategies to manage refractory and newly described toxicities, infectious risks, and delayed effects, such as cytopenias. Although much progress has been made, areas needing further improvements remain. Limited guidance exists regarding initial administration of tocilizumab with or without steroids<sep>Abstract Background Neurotoxicity is an established toxicity of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy; however, there is little information on neurotoxicity in children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) receiving CD19/CD28ζ CAR T-cells for B-cell malignancies. Methods We analyzed neurotoxicity of CD19/CD28ζ CAR T-cells in CAYA treated on a phase I study (NCT01593696). Assessments included daily inpatient monitoring, caregiver-based neuro-symptom checklist (NSC), exploratory neurocognitive assessments, clinically-indicated imaging, CSF analysis, and systematic cytokine profiling, outcomes of which were associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and treatment response postinfusion. Patients with active CNS leukemia were included. Results Amongst 52 patients treated, 13 patients had active CNS leukemia at infusion. Neurotoxicity was<sep>Cancer outcomes with chemotherapy are inferior in patients of minority racial/ethnic groups and those with obesity. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has transformed outcomes for relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, but whether its benefits extend commensurately to racial/ethnic minorities and patients with obesity is poorly understood. With a primary focus on patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we retrospectively evaluated the impact of demographics and obesity on CAR T-cell therapy outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CAR T-cell therapy across 5 phase 1 clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute from 2012 to 2021. Among 139 B-ALL CAR T-cell infusions, 28.8%<sep>The tremendous success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in children and young adults (CAYAs) with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is tempered by toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Despite expansive information about CRS, profiling of specific end-organ toxicities secondary to CAR T-cell therapy in CAYAs is limited. This retrospective, single-center study sought to characterize end-organ specific adverse events (AEs) experienced by CAYAs during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. AEs graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were retrospectively analyzed for 134 patients enrolled in 1 of 3 phase 1 CAR T-cell trials (NCT01593696, NCT02315612, and NCT03448393), targeting CD19<sep>Abstract Remission durability following single-antigen targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells is limited by antigen modulation, which may be overcome with combinatorial targeting. Building upon our experiences targeting CD19 and CD22 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we report on our phase 1 dose-escalation study of a novel murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-CD19/CD22-4-1BB bivalent CAR T-cell (CD19.22.BBζ) for children and young adults (CAYA) with B-cell malignancies. Primary objectives included toxicity and dose finding. Secondary objectives included response rates and relapse-free survival (RFS). Biologic correlatives included laboratory investigations, CAR T-cell expansion and cytokine profiling. Twenty patients, ages 5.4 to 34.6 years, with B-ALL received CD19.22.BBζ. The complete<sep>CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CD19-CAR) T cells induce high response rates in children and young adults (CAYAs) with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), but relapse rates are high. The role for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (alloHSCT) following CD19-CAR T-cell therapy to improve long-term outcomes in CAYAs has not been examined.We conducted a phase I trial of autologous CD19.28ζ-CAR T cells in CAYAs with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. Response and long-term clinical outcomes were assessed in relation to disease and treatment variables.Fifty CAYAs with B-ALL were treated (median age, 13.5 years; range, 4.3-30.4). Thirty-one (62.0%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR), 28 (90.3%) of whom were minimal<sep>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells effectively eradicate medullary B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and can traffic to and clear central nervous system (CNS) involvement. CAR T-cell activity in non-CNS extramedullary disease (EMD) has not been well characterized. We systematically evaluated CAR T-cell kinetics, associated toxicities, and efficacy in B-ALL non-CNS EMD. We conducted a retrospective review of B-ALL patients with non-CNS EMD who were screened for/enrolled on one of three CAR trials (CD19, CD22, and CD19/22) at our institution. Non-CNS EMD was identified according to histology or radiographic imaging at extramedullary sites excluding the cerebrospinal fluid and CNS parenchyma. Of ∼180 patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL<sep>PURPOSE Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who experience relapse after or are resistant to CD19-targeted immunotherapies have limited treatment options. Targeting CD22, an alternative B-cell antigen, represents an alternate strategy. We report outcomes on the largest patient cohort treated with CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a single-center, phase I, 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial with a large expansion cohort that tested CD22-targeted CAR T cells for children and young adults with relapsed/refractory CD22 + malignancies. Primary objectives were to assess the safety, toxicity, and feasibility. Secondary objectives included efficacy, CD22 CAR T-cell persistence, and cytokine profiling. RESULTS Fifty-eight<sep>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) may present with tachycardia, hemodynamic instability and reduced cardiac function. Pediatric CAR studies examining cardiac toxicity are limited.We report on cardiac toxicity observed in children and young adults with hematologic malignancies enrolled in a CD19-28ζ CAR T-cell phase I trial (NCT01593696). All patients had a formal baseline echocardiogram. Real-time studies included echocardiograms on intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and serial troponin and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) in the select patients.From July 2012 to March 2016, 52 patients, with a median age of 13.4 years (range 4.2-30.3) were treated.

Reinfusion with the same CART product (CART2) in patients with suboptimal response or antigen positive relapse following first infusion (CART1) represents a potential treatment strategy, though early experiences suggest limited efficacy of CART2 with CD19 targeting. We report on our experience with CART2 across a host of novel CAR T-cell trials. This was a retrospective review of children and young adults with B-ALL who received reinfusion with an anti-CD19, anti-CD22, or anti-CD19/22 CART construct on one of 3 CAR T-cells trials at the National Cancer<sep>Background Hematologic toxicities, including coagulopathy, endothelial activation, and cytopenias, with CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies correlate with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity severity, but little is known about the extended toxicity profiles of CAR T-cells targeting alternative antigens. This report characterizes hematologic toxicities seen following CD22 CAR T-cells and their relationship to CRS and neurotoxicity. Methods We retrospectively characterized hematologic toxicities associated with CRS seen on a phase 1 study of anti-CD22 CAR T-cells for children and young adults with relapsed/refractory CD22+ hematologic malignancies. Additional analyses included correlation of hematologic toxicities with neurotoxicity and exploring effects of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like toxicities (HLH) on bone<sep>Outcomes for post-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy (CART) relapse are poor. The utilization of a unique CAR T cell construct for post-CART failure is increasing, but this approach is not well described. In this study, with CART-A the first unique CAR T cell construct received and CART-B the second, the primary objective was to characterize outcomes following CART-B. Secondary objectives included evaluating safety and toxicity with sequential CART infusions; investigating the impact of potential factors, such as antigen modulation and interval therapy, on CART-B response; and characterizing long-term outcomes in patients receiving multiple CARTs.

Effective therapies for post-CART relapse are limited but may include infusion of a unique CART construct, a strategy distinct from reinfusion of the same CART product. Given limited data evaluating outcomes of a unique CART as salvage therapy for post-CART relapse, we report on the impact of prior CART constructs on subsequent CART responses. Methods: This was a retrospective review (NCT03827343) of children and young adults receiving CD19 and/or CD22 CART therapy for B-ALL between 7/1/12-12/30/21 at our center. Patients included received at least 2<sep>Neuroimaging findings in immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) have not been systematically described. To address this gap in knowledge, we created a retrospective database (CARNIVAL) of neuroimaging studies obtained in patients with hematologic malignancies who received CAR T cell therapy (CAR T) at 6 pediatric institutions within the CARNATION consortium. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the range of neuroimaging findings that are associated with acute ICANS. The secondary objective was to determine whether particular neurologic symptoms are associated with specific imaging findings. Neuroimaging studies were uploaded to a cloud-based platform (AMBRA). Patient data were captured in RedCAP. All patients with<sep>Emerging data links characteristics of the apheresis product with outcomes following chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, but data on predictive markers in the pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) population are limited. Given the ability to modify manufacturing and pre-collection therapies to optimize CAR T-cell functionality, identifying key biomarkers at the time of apheresis is imperative to guide decision making and improve outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed CD4/CD8-selected apheresis (T-cells) from children and young adults who were treated with CD22 CAR T-cells for B-ALL (NCT02315612). Analysis included flow cytometry for T-cell immunophenotype, activation, and exhaustion markers, Seahorse metabolic profiling, and RNA sequencing. We compared patients who<sep>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have now been used in children and young adults (CAYA) with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) for over 10 years, yet data on long-term follow-up remains limited. Given the potential role of CAR T-cells in achieving long-term cure, the study of late effects following CAR T-cell therapy in CAYA is imperative. We retrospectively evaluated long-term outcomes in CAYA with r/r B-ALL who received a CAR T-cell infusion across one of our 3 phase I studies targeting CD19 and/or CD22 and remained in long-term follow-up (NCT03827343). The analysis cohort was restricted to those who were 1) ≥ 2 years<sep>While all currently FDA approved CAR T-cells have been manufactured using bag culture, there is growing interest in closed-system bioreactors to facilitate decentralized manufacturing, improve access, and decrease cost. It is critical to understand how new platforms impact CAR T-cell functionality, yet direct comparisons between platforms are lacking. In the context of CD22 CAR T-cells for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we compare clinical outcomes across two manufacturing platforms. We retrospectively compared outcomes for children and young adults with B-ALL treated with CD22 CAR T-cells at Stanford (NCT04088890, NCT04088864) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (NCT02315612).

Lymphodepletion has been paramount to CAR T-cell expansion and efficacy. Recent data identified an association of fludarabine exposure with reduced relapse rates, longer leukemia free survival, and more prolonged B-cell aplasia following tisagenlecleucel. However, the relationship of fludarabine exposure to lymphopenia and the mechanism by which dosing impacts outcomes following CAR T-cells remains unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of children and young adults with B-ALL who received fludarabine for lymphodepletion (LD) prior to infusion of anti-CD19, anti-CD22, or anti-CD19/22 bispecific CAR T-cells.

Series II: Nachlass. A: Nachgelassene Schriften. Vol. 13: Ästhetische Schriften</title><abstract>Abstract According to what is now the standard account in the history of psychology, in the 1880s William James and the Danish physician Carl Georg Lange independently developed a strikingly new theory, commonly referred to as the ‘James–Lange’ theory of emotion. In this paper it is argued that this standard account is highly misleading. Lange's views on affect in his (1885) Om Sindsbevægelser were more cautious than James allowed, and not open to criticisms that have often been levelled against the theory of emotion that James claimed he shared with Lange. In fact, Lange argued for distinctions that James did not mention in his discussion of Lange's work. Even with regard to the primary emotions, the two thinkers’ explanatory models diverged significantly. The contrast between James and Lange on affect is especially striking in their respective discussions of topics in aesthetics, as is established with reference to Lange's little-known (1899) Bidrag til Nydelsernes fysiologi som grundlag for en rationel æstetik.<sep>This chapter identifies three rival interpretations of Autumn Sonata. A first reading describes a work that, like Face to Face, was conceived along Janovian lines, and that consequently resonates positively with the tenets of Janov’s psychology. The second and third interpretations both deny that Autumn Sonata is consistently Janovian. According to one kind of ‘non-Janovian’ interpretation, Bergman worked with significant Janovian premises as he conceived of the story and characterizations for Autumn Sonata, yet for various reasons, the director did not, finally, go on to make a thoroughly Janovian work. An alternative interpretation contends that Bergman had taken some critical distance from at least some of the main tenets of Janov’s psychological theory and successfully expressed these reservations in his film. In other words, Bergman was not thoroughly or consistently persuaded of the truth of Janov’s theoretical contentions, either at the time of his initial, enthusiastic reading of The Primal Screen or upon subsequent reflection. On the basis of an examination of the relevant evidence, the chapter argues that although Bergman undeniably sought to bring out a story along Janovian lines, he ended up with one that instructively manifests ways in which that doctrine is incomplete and problematic.<sep>At the time of his death in 1848, Bernard Bolzano had completed two essays in aesthetics, one on beauty and one on the fine arts (Bolzano, 1843, 1849, 2015, 2017; for background and commentary see Rusnock and Šebestík, 2019, pp. 544–594; Livingston, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2021). Bolzano continued in his final years to work on topics in aesthetics, leaving behind a variety of drafts and notes. The volume under review is the long-awaited publication of this Nachlass. Editorial work on the volume was begun many years ago by the talented and industrious Bolzano scholar, Jan Berg, yet remained incomplete at the time of his death in 2015. The editor-in-chief of the Bernard-Bolzano-Gesamtausgabe, Edgar Morscher, shouldered the responsibility for bringing the project to completion. He was assisted by Kurt F. Strasser and Berg’s long-time collaborator, Peter Michael Schenkel. The contents of this volume can be briefly indicated as follows: This is critical-editorial scholarship at its best. The manuscripts that Bolzano left behind are in a very difficult and, at times, illegible hand. Bolzano used many abbreviations, only hinting at the words he had in mind. He made many corrections, often filled the margins with additions, and struck out lines or even entire pages of legible prose. The transcription of these texts demanded a painstaking and time-consuming process of educated mind-reading, an art that Berg had duly perfected in his editing of many volumes in the Gesamtausgabe.</abstract>", "passage2": "<keyword>Creole language<sep>Style (visual arts)<sep>Poetry<sep>Persona<sep>Frame (networking)<sep>Context (archaeology)<sep>Point (geometry)<sep>Narratology<sep>Narrative</keyword><title>‘[P]laying ghetto’: Style Shifting to Jamaican Creole in Marlon James’ A Brief History of Seven Killings<sep>‘Your duplicitous point of view’: Delayed revelations of hypothetical focalisation in Ian McEwan’s<i>Atonement</i>and<i>Sweet Tooth</i></title><abstract>This paper explores the linguistic phenomenon of style shifting within the dialogue of Marlon James’ polyphonic 2014 novel A Brief History of Seven Killings. In doing so, a combination of socio- and fictolinguistic theories are harnessed. The paper also suggests the introduction of the term dissociative convergence, to more finely delineate a style-shifting subtype. The character selected as the primary case study in this examination of fictional style shifting is Nina Burgess, whose pseudonyms include Kim Clarke, Dorcas Palmer and Millicent Segree. Just as Nina adopts a variety of aliases across the novel, so too does she navigate among a variety of the Creole continuum’s lects, projecting a range of distinct personas. Demonstrating Nina is a paradigm example of Sebba’s (1993) ‘many-personed speaker’, five style-shifting instances evincing five different personas are first analysed stylistically, then considered within the context of the novel’s commentary upon gender, class and culture.<sep>Framed by cognitive-poetic and possible worlds theories, this article explores two 21st century novels by the British postmodernist author Ian McEwan. Building upon Ryan’s (1991) seminal conceptualisation of the theory in relation to literature and using the novels as case studies, possible worlds theory is used to explain the unique and destabilising stylistic effects at play in the texts, which result in a ‘duplicitous point of view’ and consequent disorientation for the reader. With reference to the stylistically deviant texts of McEwan, it is argued that revisions to current theoretical frameworks are warranted. Most significantly, the concepts of suppositious text-possible worlds and (total) frame readjustment are introduced. Further to this, neuropsychiatric research is applied to the novels, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary overlap in the study of narrative focalisation. It is concluded that the duplicity integral to both novels’ themes and texture is effected through artful use of hypothetical focalisation and suppositious text-possible worlds.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/246933/professor-department-of-theory-and-practice-of-foreign-language/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5035147022", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5044017717", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A's research focuses on philosophy, aesthetics, and psychology, which aligns less directly with the job's emphasis on language teaching, curriculum development, and educational technologies, whereas Candidate B's work on Creole language, style shifting, and narrative techniques in literature is more relevant to the linguistic and pedagogical aspects of the role.\nPreferred: B\nConfidence score: 100", "created": 1737539831, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 76, "prompt_tokens": 2436, "total_tokens": 2512, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 2372}, "comparison": "Candidate A's research focuses on philosophy, aesthetics, and psychology, which aligns less directly with the job's emphasis on language teaching, curriculum development, and educational technologies, whereas Candidate B's work on Creole language, style shifting, and narrative techniques in literature is more relevant to the linguistic and pedagogical aspects of the role.", "preferred": "B", "confidence_score": 100, "passage_rank1": 54, "passage_rank2": 36}

Longitudinal characterisation of haematological and biochemical parameters in cancer patients prior to and during COVID-19 reveals features associated with outcomeESMO OpenVol. 6Issue 1PreviewCancer patients are at increased risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cancer and its treatment affect many haematological and biochemical parameters, therefore we analysed these prior to and during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and correlated them with outcome. Full-Text PDF Open Access<sep>Biliary tract cancer, comprising gallbladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and ampullary cancer, represents a more uncommon entity outside high-endemic areas, though global incidence is rising. The majority of patients present at a late stage, and 5-year survival remains poor. Advanced stage disease is incurable, and though palliative chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival, further diagnostic and therapeutic options are required in order to improve patient outcomes. Although certain subtypes of biliary tract cancer are relatively rich in targetable mutations, attaining tumour tissue for histological diagnosis and treatment monitoring is challenging due to locoregional anatomical constraints and patient fitness. Liquid biopsies offer a safe and convenient alternative to invasive procedures and have great potential as diagnostic, predictive and prognostic biomarkers. In this review, the current standard of care for patients with biliary tract cancer, future treatment horizons and the possible utility of liquid biopsies within a variety of contexts will be discussed. Circulating tumour DNA, circulating microRNA and circulating tumour cells are discussed with<sep>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a disruptive event for cancer patients, especially those with haematological malignancies (HM). They may experience a more severe clinical course due to impaired immune responses. This multi-center retrospective UK audit identified cancer patients who had SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March and 10 June 2020 and collected data pertaining to cancer history, COVID-19 presentation and outcomes. In total, 179 patients were identified with a median age of 72 (IQR 61, 81) and follow-up of 44 days (IQR 42, 45). Forty-one percent were female and the overall mortality was 37%. Twenty-nine percent had HM and of these, those treated with chemotherapy in the preceding 28 days to COVID-19 diagnosis had worse outcome compared with solid malignancy (SM): 62% versus 19% died [HR 8.33 (95% CI, 2.56-25), p < 0.001]. Definite or probable nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission accounted for 16% of cases and was associated with increased risk of death (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.43-4.29, p = 0.001). Patients with haematological<sep>In this work, we present a novel trajectory comparison algorithm to identify abnormal vital sign trends, with the aim of improving recognition of deteriorating health.There is growing interest in continuous wearable vital sign sensors for monitoring patients remotely at home. These monitors are usually coupled to an alerting system, which is triggered when vital sign measurements fall outside a predefined normal range. Trends in vital signs, such as increasing heart rate, are often indicative of deteriorating health, but are rarely incorporated into alerting systems.We introduce a dynamic time warp distance-based measure to compare time series trajectories. We split each multi-variable sign time series into 180 minute, non-overlapping epochs. We then calculate the distance between all pairs of epochs. Each epoch is characterized by its mean pairwise distance (average link distance) to all other epochs, with clusters forming with nearby epochs.We demonstrate in synthetically generated data that this method can identify abnormal epochs and cluster epochs with similar trajectories. We then apply this<sep>CONTACT is a national multidisciplinary study assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon diagnostic and treatment pathways among patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).The treatment of consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PDAC from a pre-COVID-19 pandemic cohort (07/01/2019-03/03/2019) were compared to a cohort diagnosed during the first wave of the UK pandemic ('COVID' cohort, 16/03/2020-10/05/2020), with 12-month follow-up.Among 984 patients (pre-COVID: n = 483, COVID: n = 501), the COVID cohort was less likely to receive staging investigations other than CT scanning (29.5% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.010). Among patients treated with curative intent, there was a reduction in the proportion of patients recommended surgery (54.5% vs. 76.6%, p = 0.001) and increase in the proportion recommended upfront chemotherapy (45.5% vs. 23.4%, p = 0.002). Among patients on a non-curative pathway, fewer patients were recommended (47.4% vs. 57.3%, p = 0.004) or received palliative anti-cancer therapy (20.5% vs. 26.5%, p = 0.045). Ultimately, fewer patients in the COVID cohort underwent surgical<sep>During the Covid-19 pandemic, ibrutinib +/- rituximab was approved in England for initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) instead of immunochemotherapy. As limited data are available in this setting, we conducted an observational cohort study evaluating safety and efficacy. Adults receiving ibrutinib +/- rituximab for untreated MCL were evaluated for treatment toxicity, response and survival, including outcomes in high-risk MCL (TP53 mutation/deletion/p53 overexpression, blastoid/pleomorphic, or Ki67 &amp;gt;/=30%). 149 patients from 43 participating centres were enrolled: 74.1% male, median age 75, 75.2% ECOG 0-1, 36.2% high-risk, 8.9% autologous transplant candidates. All patients received &amp;gt;/= 1 cycle ibrutinib (median 8 cycles), 39.0% with rituximab. Grade &amp;gt;/= 3 toxicity occurred in 20.3%, 33.8% required dose reductions/delays.

Of 104 response-assessed patients, overall (ORR) and complete response (CR) rates were 71.2% and 20.2% respectively. ORR was 77.3% (low-risk) vs. 59.0% (high-risk), p=0.05, and 78.7% (ibrutinib-rituximab) vs. 64.9% (ibrutinib), p=0.13. Median progression-free survival was<sep>Introduction: Bendamustine is among the most effective chemotherapeutics for indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (iNHL), but trial reports of significant toxicity, including opportunistic infections and excess deaths, led to prescriber warnings. We conducted a multicentre observational study evaluating bendamustine toxicity in real-world practice. Methods: Patients receiving at least one dose of bendamustine (B) +/- rituximab (R) for iNHL were included. Demographics, lymphoma and treatment details and grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) were analysed. Results: 323 patients were enrolled from 9 NHS hospitals. Most patients (96%) received BR and 46% R maintenance. 21.7% experienced serious AEs (SAE) related to treatment, including infections in 12%, with absolute risk highest during induction (63%), maintenance (20%), and follow-up (17%), and the relative risk highest during maintenance (54%), induction (34%) and follow-up (28%). Toxicity led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 13% of patients, and 2.8% died of bendamustine-related infections (n=5), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=3), and cardiac disease (n=1). More SAEs per patient were reported in patients with mantle cell<sep>Patients with cancer have been shown to have increased risk of COVID-19 severity. We previously built and validated the COVID-19 Risk in Oncology Evaluation Tool (CORONET) to predict the likely severity of COVID-19 in patients with active cancer who present to hospital. We assessed the differences in presentation and outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19, depending on the wave of the pandemic. We examined differences in features at presentation and outcomes in patients worldwide, depending on the waves of the pandemic: wave 1 D614G (n = 1430), wave 2 Alpha (n = 475), and wave 4 Omicron variant (n = 63, UK and Spain only). The performance of CORONET was evaluated on 258, 48, and 54 patients for each wave, respectively. We found that mortality rates were reduced in subsequent waves. The majority of patients were vaccinated in wave 4, and 94% were treated with steroids if they required oxygen. The stages of cancer and the median ages of patients significantly<sep>Abstract Background: Cancer patients with Covid-19 causing less severe illness have been safely managed in an outpatient setting but they remain at risk of clinical deterioration. In this pilot study we assessed the feasibility of using wearable biosensors to monitor key physiological data in ambulatory, home based, cancer patients with Covid-19 infection. Two key components of feasibility were assessed: patient acceptability of the devices, and the reliability of transmitting the data in real-time to the treating hospital. Methods: Ambulatory cancer patients with Covid-19 consented to wearing sensors monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature, along with twice daily pulse oximetry measurements for up to three weeks. All physiologic data were transmitted from home to the treating hospital via a secure cellular data pathway. Data other than oxygen saturations was analysed retrospectively. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were completed by patients and thematic qualitative analysis performed. Results: 8 patients (6 female, 2 male) with a median age of 62 years (range 40-73) were recruited.<sep>Cancer patients (pts) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection and death. Older pts, men and those with haematological malignancies and receiving anti-tumour therapy within 14 days appear to be at highest risk for poor outcomes. In general populations, severe COVID-19 infection has been associated with neutrophilia, raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Cancer and its treatment affect many haematological and biochemical parameters. We examined whether COVID-19 infection affected these compared to pts’ baseline parameters by longitudinal tracking. We also investigated whether changes were associated with poor outcome. Consecutive pts with solid or haematological malignancies presenting with index symptoms and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a tertiary oncology centre were identified following institutional board approval. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from the pt record. Paired T-tests were used for longitudinal sampling and ANOVA/Chi squared for outcomes. 52 pts tested positive (27 male, 25 female; median age 63). 80.5% had solid cancers, and 19.5% haematological. 31/52 pts were lymphopenic<sep>In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of tocilizumab in adult patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 with both hypoxia and systemic inflammation.This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing several possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Those trial participants with hypoxia (oxygen saturation <92% on air or requiring oxygen therapy) and evidence of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein ≥75 mg/L) were eligible for random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to usual standard of care alone versus usual standard of care plus tocilizumab at a dose of 400 mg-800 mg (depending on weight) given intravenously. A second dose could be given 12-24 h later if the patient's condition had not improved. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936).Between April 23, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021, 4116 adults of 21 550 patients enrolled into the RECOVERY trial were<sep>Patients (pts) with cancer are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection and death. Due to the heterogeneity of manifestations of COVID-19, accurate assessment of patients presenting to hospital is crucial. Early identification of pts who are likely to deteriorate allows timely discussions regarding escalation of care. It is equally important to identify pts who could be safely managed at home. To aid clinical decision making, we developed a model to determine which pts should be admitted vs. discharged at presentation to hospital. Consecutive pts with solid or haematological malignancies presenting with symptoms who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 10 UK hospitals from March-May 2020 were identified following institutional board approval. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from pt records. Clinical outcome measures were discharge within 24 hours, requirement for oxygen at any stage during admission and death. The associations between clinical features and outcomes were examined using ANOVA or Chi-squared tests. A logistic model was developed using clinical features with p<0.05<sep>7065 Background: Immune-related adverse events (irAE) are a recognised complication of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Previous characterisation of irAEs has been limited to clinical trial or registry populations and small case series. Here we present a multi-centre, granular, real-world analysis of the prevalence and outcomes of irAEs experienced by patients managed within a single comprehensive public health service. Methods: A multi-centre retrospective analysis of 2125 consecutive patients treated with ICIs was undertaken across 12 centres. All patients were managed within the UK National Health Service outside of a trial setting between June 2016 and September 2018. Patients received either ICI monotherapy (MT) or combination therapy (CT). Data were collected using a standardised, pre-piloted, collection tool. IrAEs ≥ grade 2 or endocrinopathies of any grade were considered clinically significant and recorded as per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (V5) (CTCAE). Descriptive statistics were employed using Stata v15 (College Station, TX). Results: Patients received αPD-1 (1757; 82%), combination αPD-1/αCTLA-4 (285, 13%),<sep>Aspirin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of its anti-thrombotic properties. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.In this randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The trial took place at 177 hospitals in the UK, two hospitals in Indonesia, and two hospitals in Nepal. Eligible and consenting adults were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either usual standard of care plus 150 mg aspirin once per day until discharge or usual standard of care alone using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28 day mortality. All analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936).Between Nov 1, 2020, and March 21, 2021, 14 892 (66%) of 22 560 patients enrolled into the RECOVERY trial were eligible to be randomly allocated to<sep>We aimed to evaluate the use of baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1-2 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was done, which included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936) and is ongoing.Between Feb 2 and Dec 29, 2021, from 10 852 enrolled, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib<sep>12026 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is now commonly used in a range of tumours and settings. Most data relating to outcomes and rates of immune-related adverse events (irAE) is derived from clinical trial or registry populations and small case series. Limited data exist for patients aged &gt; 75 years. Here we present a multi-centre, real-world analysis of the outcomes and incidence of irAEs in older adults managed within a single comprehensive public health service. We also compare these outcomes to younger patients in the same cohort. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 2049 patients treated with ICIs was undertaken across 12 centres. All patients were managed within the UK National Health Service outside of a trial setting between June 2016 and September 2018. Patients received either ICI monotherapy (MT) or duel combination ICI therapy (CT) for malignant melanoma (MM), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or renal cell cancer (RCC). Data were collected using a standardised, collection tool. IrAEs ≥ grade 2<sep>Low-dose corticosteroids have been shown to reduce mortality for patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen or ventilatory support (non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). We evaluated the use of a higher dose of corticosteroids in this patient group.This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adult patients with clinical evidence of hypoxia (ie, receiving oxygen or with oxygen saturation <92% on room air) were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual care with higher dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg dexamethasone once daily for 5 days or until discharge if sooner) or usual standard of care alone (which included dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days or until discharge if sooner). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality among all randomised participants. On May 11, 2022, the independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping recruitment of<sep>2522 Background: Pre-existing autoimmune disease (AID) potentially increases the propensity for the development of immune related adverse events (irAE) in response to oncological immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is biologically plausible and clinically observed. However, due to consistent clinical trial exclusion of those with pre-existing AID, the impact on the frequency and severity of irAEs is uncertain. Here we analyse this relationship in a large, real-world, UK multi-centre cohort. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 2049 patients treated with ICIs over a two year period was undertaken across 12 National Health Service centres by the UK National Oncology Trainees Collaborative for Healthcare Research (NOTCH). Patients received ICIs as standard of care for malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. The presence of pre-existing AIDs was assessed and classified as either autoantibody driven or autoinflammatory then correlated with clinically significant irAEs (i.e. ≥grade 2 or all-grade endocrinopathies). Statistical analyses included T-test, Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared. For overall survival (OS) Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests<sep>Empagliflozin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of its anti-inflammatory, metabolic, and haemodynamic effects. The RECOVERY trial aimed to assess its safety and efficacy in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.In the randomised, controlled, open-label RECOVERY trial, several possible treatments are compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. In this analysis, we assess eligible and consenting adults who were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus oral empagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 28 days or until discharge (whichever came first) using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalisation and (among participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline) the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. On March 3, 2023 the independent data monitoring committee recommended that the investigators review the data and recruitment was consequently stopped on March 7,<sep>Introduction: For patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), the aim of second-line (2L) treatment is to achieve complete metabolic response (CMR) prior to high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Intensive chemotherapy is commonly used, but there is no standard of care and CMR rates using contemporary fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) assessment are unknown. Novel agents have shown promise, but comparative data with conventional 2L chemotherapy are lacking. We aimed to assess response to 2L chemotherapy according to the Lugano classification. Methods: This retrospective study includes all pts with R/R HL who received intensive 2L chemotherapy with intent to consolidate with ASCT at 11 UK centres between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2019. PET response was locally assessed using Deauville criteria (DS). CMR was defined as a DS of 1-3. Survival was measured from start of 2L treatment. Results: 252 pts were included: 58% were male and median age at 2L treatment was 32y (range 16-70). 87% had received ABVD<sep>BackgroundCasirivimab and imdevimab are non-competing monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, blocking viral entry into host cells. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of casirivimab and imdevimab administered in combination in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.MethodsRECOVERY is a randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing several possible treatments with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 127 UK hospitals took part in the evaluation of casirivimab and imdevimab. Eligible participants were any patients aged at least 12 years admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We assessed the proportions meeting each diagnostic criterion with constitutional or mosaic NF2 variants and the positive predictive value (PPV) with regard to definite diagnosis.There was no evidence for usefulness of old criteria \"glioma\" or \"neurofibroma.\" \"Ependymoma\" had 100% PPV and high levels of confirmed NF2 diagnosis (67.7%). Those with bilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS) alone aged ≥60 years had the lowest confirmation rate (6.6%) and reduced PPV (80%). Siblings as a first-degree relative, without an affected parent, had 0% PPV. All three individuals with unilateral VS and an affected sibling were proven not to have NF2. The biggest overlap was with LZTR1-associated schwannomatosis. In this category, seven individuals with unilateral VS plus ≥2 nondermal schwannomas reduced PPV to 67%.The present study confirms important deficiencies in NF2 diagnostic criteria. The term \"glioma\" should be dropped and replaced by \"ependymoma.\" Similarly \"neurofibroma\" should be removed. Dropping \"sibling\" from first-degree relatives should be considered and testing of LZTR1 should be recommended for unilateral VS.<sep>PurposeTo evaluate the incidence of mosaicism in de novo neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2).MethodsPatients fulfilling NF2 criteria, but with no known affected family member from a previous generation (n = 1055), were tested for NF2 variants in lymphocyte DNA and where available tumor DNA. The proportion of individuals with a proven or presumed mosaic NF2 variant was assessed and allele frequencies of identified variants evaluated using next-generation sequencing.ResultsThe rate of proven/presumed mosaicism was 232/1055 (22.0%). However, nonmosaic heterozygous pathogenic variants were only identified in 387/1055 (36.7%). When variant detection rates in second generation nonmosaics were applied to de novo cases, we assessed the overall probable mosaicism rate to be 59.7%. This rate differed by age from 21.7% in those presenting with bilateral vestibular schwannoma <20 years to 80.7% in those aged ≥60 years. A mosaic variant was detected in all parents of affected children with a single-nucleotide pathogenic NF2 variant.ConclusionThis study has identified a very high probable mosaicism rate in de novo NF2, probably making NF2 the condition with the highest expressed rate of mosaicism in de novo dominant disease that is nonlethal in heterozygote form. Risks to offspring are small and probably correlate with variant allele frequency detected in blood.<sep>The neurofibromatoses, which include neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), and schwannomatosis, are a group of syndromes characterized by tumor growth in the nervous system. The RASopathies are a group of syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components of the RAS/mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The RASopathies include NF1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, Costello syndrome, cardio‐facio‐cutaneous syndrome, Legius syndrome, capillary malformation arterio‐venous malformation syndrome, and SYNGAP1 autism. Due to their common underlying pathogenetic etiology, all these syndromes have significant phenotypic overlap of which one common feature include a predisposition to tumors, which may be benign or malignant. Together as a group, they represent one of the most common multiple congenital anomaly syndromes estimating to affect approximately one in 1000 individuals worldwide. The subcontinent of India represents one of the largest populations in the world, yet remains underserved from an aspect of clinical genetics services. In an effort to bridge this gap, the First International Conference on RASopathies and Neurofibromatoses in Asia: Identification and Advances of New Therapeutics was held in Kochi, Kerala, India. These proceedings chronicle this timely and topical international symposium directed at discussing the best practices and therapies for individuals with neurofibromatoses and RASopathies.<sep>Many patients with cochlear implants (CI) and auditory brainstem implants (ABI) require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following implantation. This study explores the patient experience of MRI, identifying factors associated with pain, and the effect of interventions designed to enhance comfort and safety.A prospective observational case series from a tertiary referral unit. Tight head bandaging ± local anaesthetic injection (devices with non-MRI-compatible magnets) or observation alone (implants with MRI-compatible magnets) were employed for 1.5 T MRI of consecutive adult patients with CI or ABI without magnet removal. Pain was recorded via visual analogue scale (1 = no pain, 5 = extreme pain) at three time points; (1) baseline, (2) head bandage applied (3) during scanning. Patient age, device type, body area imaged and total scan time were recorded as variables, alongside adverse events.Data were collected for 227 MRI scans (34 patients with ABI, 32 with CI). In patients managed with bandaging, pain score after bandaging but prior to scanning (median 2.2) did not differ from pain during scanning (2.1), but both were significantly higher than baseline (1.4, both P ≤ 0.001). Scanning areas other than the head/cervical spine was associated with higher pain scores (P = 0.036). Pain during MRI differed between different manufacturers implants (P ≤ 0.001). Adverse events occurred in 8/227 scans (3.5%), none occurring with devices containing an MRI-compatible magnet.MRI scanning with auditory implant magnets in situ is safe and well tolerated by patients.</abstract>", "query_id": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/listing/127464/research-project-assistant-radiotherapy-related-research-group/", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5067709627", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5031670660", "response": "Comparison: Candidate A demonstrates extensive experience in clinical research, particularly in cancer-related studies, with a strong focus on translational research, clinical trials, and data analysis, aligning closely with the job description's requirements for supporting radiotherapy-related research projects.

This is an important extension to theory and one which is eminently testable using small business – loan contracting data.<sep>Market entry decisions are complex and involve high sunk costs with uncertain or risky outcomes. In this study we explore how the owner, firm, and competitive pressures shape this decision. Using a large UK data set of SMEs, we find that the preferred form of growth, and growth is not always desired, is expansion in existing markets. Key determinants of the decision to pursue a new market entry strategy are formal education, and large firm based market competition. Further, these decisions are made simultaneously not sequentially. Keywords: market entry, firm growth, owner characteristics,<sep>• The gender gap in Old Europe has diminished significantly and is estimated to be as low as 6–7%. • The gender gap in New Europe remains large and could be as high as four times that in Old Europe. • The propensity to become self-employed increases in age past the common retirement age of 65. • The education structure of the self-employed is such that the lowest and highest educated both prefer self-employment. • Political and economic turmoil takes a generation to work its way through the system, but it is associated<sep>A standard UK debt contract has two price components, the interest rate margin which is paid ex post and the up-front fee which is paid ex ante. The interest rate margin reflects risk, whilst the up-front fee is a mechanism for banks to price contract options and to screen borrowers, thus we cannot treat the fee as exogenous in interest rate margins as interest rate margins and fees may be jointly determined. Our empirical evidence shows that the two are indeed jointly determined, but that interest rate margins have a stronger (positive) effect<sep>Loan guarantee schemes are the primary public policy for addressing credit rationing of smaller firms across the world. In this paper we use four decades of data from the UK scheme to examine how sensitive demand for guaranteed loans is to the two main scheme parameters, the interest rate premium and guarantee coverage rate, as well as the state of the macroeconomy. Using an error correction model, we find that demand is particularly sensitive to the interest rate premium and to a lesser extent the guarantee coverage. In economic crisis periods demand naturally<sep>This study examines the effect of entrepreneurial under-and-overconfidence on SMEs’ access to external finance. Besides the conventional wisdom that overconfidence leads to sub-optimal financing decisions and higher financing costs, we contend that moderate overconfidence induces entrepreneurs to commit costly effort, which is seen as a favorable signal by financiers. We test this trade-off hypothesis using a large sample of UK SMEs and a novel measure of overconfidence. We find significant non-linear relationships between overconfidence and alternative access to finance measures. Specifically, we show that mildly overconfident entrepreneurs are less likely to be credit<sep>Abstract Recent research into the gender aspects of small business financing has shown that in crisis periods, banks actively reward female entrepreneurs with privileged access to loans because they put forward more realistic and cautious funding proposals compared to hubristic male entrepreneurs. We build on this research by considering in greater detail how broader gender differences in entrepreneurial confidence play out in the context of bank lending. Further, we also question whether banks treat overconfident female entrepreneurs differently from their overconfident male counterparts. Our findings show that on average there is no discrimination,<sep>This editorial introduces the papers addressing regional and spatial aspects relating to the demand for, and the supply of, finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. Reflecting the breadth of financial instruments that are potentially available to SMEs and new ventures (e.g., business angel, bank credit and credit card financing), this special issue offers a combination of up-to-date studies that integrate the regional and spatial perspectives into the debate on SMEs and start-up financing. Overall, the papers contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms by which geography shapes access to finance<sep>The economic consequences of COVID-19 were severe with restricted economic activity generating a liquidity crisis for many firms. To address the systemic impact of this liquidity shock, governments around the world rapidly introduced a range of loan guarantee schemes. In the UK, more than 1 million businesses accessed these schemes. Using a novel, comprehensive dataset, this paper explores the regional distribution of access to these schemes and how this was mediated by regional differences in lending institution. Our results show that while the schemes were national and unaligned with regional policy, access favoured<sep>Abstract In this paper we use a large UK survey of business angels (BAs) investing in two different publicly supported schemes to directly question the role that investment motivations play in shaping investors’ appetite for risk. We dive deeper into the relationship between investment reasons and risk taking, by exploring the potential for a moderating effect derived from BAs’ past experience (i.e. financial and entrepreneurial experience). Our analysis reveals that both investment reasons (for return and for passion) have substantial explanatory power in shaping angels’ risk attitude, but their effect is moderated by<sep>The availability of economic, financial, and business data, and their use in empirical scientific entrepreneurship research, has increased significantly in recent decades. The ever-increasing number of researchers looking for answers to important scientific questions, usually followed by political implications that shape people, firms, and societies, and the use of econometrics and statistics as a means of analysing different forms of data, make it increasingly necessary to provide a handbook that can act as an information guide for quantitative analysts and those interested in quantitative entrepreneurship research. This handbook focuses on a number of<sep>There is an evolving body of empirical evidence suggesting that larger banks charge a higher interest rate for apparently homogeneous loans. We explain why the dominant market position of large banks might lead to more expensive loans for smaller firms, and, if they do, the likely consequences of such behaviour. However, we find little evidence that big banks price loans to small firms at a higher rate than larger firms. Rather, we find important differences in terms of what types of firms and what types of loans are sought and offered by Big-4<sep>Entry to export markets can stimulate business growth, yet remarkably few small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) pursue export strategies. Using data gathered from the UK Small Business Surveys and a theoretical framework that combines principles from the resource-based view of the firm with notions of “investment readiness” and “managerial capacity,” we examine the empirical relationships between new product development (NPD) and new market entry (NME) capabilities on UK SMEs export decisions. Among other things, we find that there are contexts in which SMEs should develop these capabilities concurrently and others in which they<sep>Clean technology (cleantech) is becoming increasingly important as firms and industries seek to address challenges around the global scarcity of resources and also achieve wider social and environmental goals. Yet there are underlying problems with how capital markets respond to this increasing demand for new and innovative cleantech investments. In this article, we use a large U.K. dataset to first consider the extent to which firms engaging with cleantech increase their demand for external capital. We then consider how different types of debt and equity financiers deal with this demand for funds. Our<sep>Abstract Recent research has identified a key subset of the business population that comprises firms who had sought external finance but subsequently withdrew from the credit market completely despite still requiring finance. Utilising the UK’s Longitudinal Small Business Survey between 2015 and 2020, we identify the consequences in terms of lost jobs and sales of these small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dropping out of the credit market for finance. We conduct our analysis at the regional and sub-regional level and found that around 230,000 SMEs have dropped out of the UK credit market<sep>It is well documented that the self-employed experience higher levels of happiness than waged employees even when their incomes are lower. Given the UK government’s asymmetric treatment of waged workers and the self-employed, we use a unique Covid-19 period data set which covers the months leading up to the March lockdown and the months just after to assess three aspects of the Covid-19 crisis on the self-employed: hours of work reductions, the associated income reductions and the effects of both on subjective well-being. Our findings show the large and disproportionate reductions in hours<sep>To effectively mitigate climate change, a crucial focus area is enhancing energy efficiency in firms and industries. This objective becomes even more imperative in light of the recent escalation in energy prices caused by the Russo-Ukrainian war. Given the limited financial resources of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), facilitating their access to finance becomes a potential avenue for reducing carbon emissions. Based on our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the potential impact of energy efficiency on access to finance for SMEs in the UK. We consider a dataset of 2855<sep>Access to inexpensive short-term credit from banks is vital for many small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which face liquidity problems because of an imbalance between cash outflows and receipt of outstanding payments. This article investigates the key determinants of short-term credit access and pricing for UK SMEs, disentangling between regional effects and firm-specific effects (that is, credit risk ratings). We use a large dataset of 30,183 responses to six waves of the SME Finance Monitor survey. While there are underlying differences at the firm level in risk behavior across regions, our key finding<sep>The UK government underwrote more than 1.68 million business loans totalling £78.4bn during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that the Bounce Back Loan (BBL) had a 100% guarantee and the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) 80%, the public sector contingent liability is very large. In this article, we explore whether or not the recent and dramatic rises in UK inflation have prompted firms with COVID-19 BBL and CBILS guaranteed loans to repay their outstanding debt early (in advance of the full 6-year loan term as specified in the original loan agreement). Our results<sep>This commentary explores the manner in which the current COVID-19 crisis is affecting key sources of entrepreneurial finance in the United Kingdom. We posit that the unique relational nature of entrepreneurial finance may make it highly susceptible to such a shock owing to the need for face-to-face interaction between investors and entrepreneurs. The article explores this conjecture by scrutinising a real-time data source of equity investments. Our findings suggest that the volume of new equity transactions in the United Kingdom has declined markedly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It appears that<sep>Using gender as a theoretical framework, we analyse the dynamics of bank lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Using six waves of the SME Finance Monitor survey, we apply a formal Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition to test whether gender impacts upon the supply and demand for debt finance by women. Reflecting established evidence, we found women had a lower demand for bank loans; contradicting accepted wisdom however, we found that women who did apply were more likely to be successful. We argue that feminised risk<sep>Using data between 2009 and 2020, we provide a detailed description of the borrowers within the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) loan portfolio, analyse time to default and how it differs across lender types. For limited companies, we match additional financial and non-financial data from public and proprietary databases and profile the characteristics of EFG companies within the population of limited companies. Employing hazard models we find loans granted to unincorporated businesses by the medium-sized financial institutions are associated with a much lower hazard than those provided by smaller local lending institutions and not-for-profit<sep>Business angels (BAs) - high net worth individuals who provide informal risk capital to firms - are seen as important providers of entrepreneurial finance. Theory and conventional wisdom suggest that the need for face-to-face interaction will ensure angels will have a strong predilection for local investments. We empirically test this assumption using a large representative survey of UK BAs. Our results show local bias is less common than previously thought with only one quarter of total investments made locally. However, we also show pronounced regional disparities, with investment activity dominated by BAs in<sep>As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, a common public policy response has been to enforce the temporary closure of non-essential business activity. In some countries, governments have underwritten a proportion of the wage income for staff forced to furlough or broadened their welfare systems to accommodate newly laid off workers or small business owners. While these actions are helpful, they do not explicitly address the lack of sales trading activity on business income and cash balances. In commentary, we identify what types of businesses have been increasing their cash holdings in the lead<sep>Previous research on the financing of smaller innovative firms has established that being small per se creates problems in accessing finance, but being small and innovative adds another layer of difficulty. This new research explicitly questions whether the Covid-19 crisis has added to the debt access problems of an already disadvantaged group of firms. Using a unique Covid-19 period dataset of 9000 UK SMEs, we find that the most innovative firms had the highest demand for loans during the Covid-19 crisis and evidence that those firms trying to introduce new products and services<sep>In this commentary, we trace the economic and spatial consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of potential business failure and the associated job losses across the 100 largest cities and towns in the United Kingdom (UK). The article draws on UK survey data of 1500 firms of different size classes examining levels of firm-level precautionary savings. On business failure risk, we find a clear and unequal impact on poorer northern and peripheral urban areas of the UK, indicative of weak levels of regional resilience, but a more random distribution in terms of<sep>Abstract The scale of the UK government's response to the Covid‐19 crisis after the first lockdown in March 2020 was unprecedented. For the business sector, two financing schemes were particularly relevant: the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS). Both were designed to support the capitalization of businesses through this difficult trading period. In this paper, we use data covering the first two quarters of the Covid‐19 crisis to explore the dynamics of small and medium‐sized enterprise (SME) financing and in particular the role of government support<sep>Abstract This paper investigates the survival of entrepreneurial firms during the pandemic period. Specifically, we focus on UK companies that received equity finance during their developmental stages before the onset of Covid-19. The equity finance investors in our study include venture capital and growth finance funds (both domestic and foreign), crowd funding platforms, business angels, and government venture capital funds. We build on the resource-based view (RBV) and signalling theories to develop our hypotheses. We analyse the bankruptcy processes of companies during the Covid-19 period, comparing it to the pre-Covid period. We examine<sep>In 2012, the UK government made the decision to offer loans to new entrepreneurs who were excluded from the credit market through the start-up loan (SUL) scheme. By 2021, loans totalling £759 million have been issued to 85,809 new start-ups. A disproportionate share of these SULs was issued to previously unemployed people to support their transition into self-employment. This paper questions whether those who started with the fewest resources achieved better or worse outcomes than those who started from a more beneficial position. Our findings show that previously unemployed start-ups had smaller loans<sep>The belief that more general capital constraints are exacerbated and magnified in innovative and technology-based firms has provided justification for policy intervention, across the range of equity and debt-based financial instruments. In this article, we tackle the question as to whether smaller innovative firms, both in and outside of high-tech industry sectors, do indeed face greater constraints when seeking to access capital from external markets. Our results show that both high-tech and innovation are important determinants of the firms’ demand for external finance, but these effects are more pronounced in equity markets than<sep>In this paper we focus on the patterns of insolvency in the covid period, and the early outcomes of the loan guarantee schemes. Firstly, analysis of insolvent exits shows that the Covid-related pandemic is different from the previous crises in that the number of insolvencies decreased. Secondly, our multivariate analysis confirmed that the pattern of insolvencies differs with respect to the pre-covid period and the decrease during covid was driven mainly by the first year of the pandemic when various schemes aimed at helping the struggling economy were provided by the government. Thirdly,<sep>The UK has had a commitment to loan guarantee schemes since 1981 when it introduced the Small Firms Loan Guarantee (SFLG) scheme to address access to debt finance issues for smaller firms. Over the last 40 years, its support has been unwavering, and in the Covid-19 crisis, it once again turned to loan guarantees as a means of supporting smaller firms through the crisis-induced slump in trading activities. Of its three core Covid-19 guarantee schemes, the Bounce Back Loan (BBL) scheme was the most numerous with 1,531,095 loans issued amounting to a total<sep>Purpose Since introducing the UK start-up loan (SUL) Scheme in 2012, 82,809 new start-ups have been supported with loans totalling £759m. Even during the Covid-19 crisis, new business start-ups supported by SUL did not abate. The authors ask whether the entrepreneurs starting businesses during the Covid-19 crisis were different from those becoming entrepreneurs before the pandemic. This paper aims to discuss the aforementioned question. Design/methodology/approach The authors model the differences between pre-Covid-19 business start-ups and Covid-19 start-ups. The administrative data obtained from the UK Government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)<sep>Purpose Using ethnicity as our point of focus, the authors consider the dynamics of the demand for bank loans, and the willingness of banks to supply them, as the UK economy entered the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 with a particular focus on potential behavioural differences on the demand-side and discrimination on the supply-side. In doing so we directly address crisis induced financial concerns and how they played out in the context of ethnicity. Design/methodology/approach Using the most recent ten quarterly waves of the UK SME Finance Monitor survey the authors consider whether<sep>Abstract The concept of the ‘discouraged’ borrower is well documented. In this paper, we consider whether smaller firms in the UK who have been previously rejected for bank loans have been scarred by the experience so badly that even in the presence of two exceptionally generous Covid-19 loan guarantee schemes, they still refuse to make an application. Furthermore, we also consider what happens when they do. As banks have either zero or minimal loss exposure, do they still maintain their normal strict lending protocols or do they relax their standards to fulfil the<sep>The objective of this research was to enhance DWP’s understanding of the experience of self-employment for individuals with disabilities and health conditions – particularly the challenges experienced, and the types of support required to set-up, sustain and grow their business. Forty in-depth interviews were carried out with disabled self-employed individuals, representatives of organisations that support disabled people and self-employed people, and representatives from Jobcentre Plus.

We find a positive relationship between political uncertainty stemming from elections and the proportion of bank loans over total debts, especially when elections are closely contested. Furthermore, this relationship is stronger in opaque firms and more financially constrained firms as well as firms from countries with weaker shareholder rights, labor protection, creditor rights and national governance.<sep>We add to the literature on the economic outcomes of government debt and argue that government debt increases crash risk via two channels: (i) hoarding bad news and (ii) tax avoidance. Based on a large international sample, our results indicate that stock crash risk is positively associated with government debt. Our conclusions are robust when we treat endogeneity issues, and our tests confirm the validity of bad news hoarding and tax avoidance as channels through which government debt influences stock price crash risk.<sep>This paper examines the impact of stock price crash risk on capital structure dynamics using a sample of firms located in the GCC region. The results show that a higher exposure to stock price crash risk is associated with a lower speed of leverage adjustments toward target. We also find that this relation is more pronounced for over-levered firms compared to their under-levered peers. Our results withstand several sensitivity tests including, using alternative proxies for main dependent and independent variables, and ruling out endogeneity concerns, among other.<sep>We examine how government subsidies moderate the effect of green investment on environmental sustainability. We use a unique sample of A-shares listed firms from China between 2009 and 2021. The results demonstrate that green investments significantly reduce CO2 emission. Government subsidies are counterproductive and decrease carbon performance of sampled firms. The increase in green investments can reduce the negative effects of subsidies. The results are robust across various econometrics techniques, alternative proxy of green investment and after addressing endogeneity problems. The results offer practical implication for stakeholders and policymakers.<sep>Abstract Using a large sample of US firms, we document a significantly negative relation between the number of patents (citations) and stock price crash risk. Our findings are consistent with the arguments that patented innovation activities send a high‐quality signal and reduces proprietary information costs, which lowers information asymmetry and enhance disclosure. Further, we find that such impact of patented innovation on stock price crash risk is more pronounced in firms with weak corporate governance and high information opacity. Our findings provide new evidence on the real effects of patented innovation on crash risk in equity market.<sep>Using machine learning-based firm-level measures for political risk (P-Risk) and climate change risk (CC-Risk) in a large sample of US firms from 2002 to 2021, we document that firms facing higher political risk are susceptible to higher climate change risk. Our findings are immune to critical concerns related to reverse causality, sample selection bias, and measurement errors. Moreover, our documented positive relationship between P-Risk and CC-Risk shows consistent cross-sectional implications and adds to the consideration of various political, social, environmental, and economic factors. Overall, we posit that the severity of political risk may also expose a firm to environmental risk.<sep>This study examines whether labor unemployment risk affects the choice of debt source. Specifically, we examine whether US unemployment insurance (UI) benefits, which reduce unemployment risk, lead to a heavy reliance on bank debt. Through difference-in-difference analysis, we find that firms in states with generous UI benefits tend to rely more on bank debt, supporting the monitoring avoidance channel. This finding is robust to a battery of robustness tests. We also find that the positive relationship between UI benefits and bank debt ratio is more pronounced in firms from highly unionized states, labor-intensive firms, and firms with higher asset substitution risk. Finally, we find that debt maturity (security) decreases (increases) when UI benefits increase.<sep>This study examines the relationship between financial literacy and the leverage of small firms, specifically of the legal forms, sole proprietorships, and partnerships. Using a cross-section of 73,302 firms in 22 countries, we find that the leverage of small firms is negatively associated with financial literacy. Further, we explore the role of financial development, bankruptcy and transaction costs, and information asymmetry, in moderating the relationship. We find that the negative relationship is less pronounced in countries with lower financial development, high bankruptcy and transaction costs, and high information asymmetry environments, respectively. We contribute to the understanding of small firms' leverage and the literature on financial literacy, SMEs, finance, and entrepreneurship. This study offers policy implications for economies that promote SMEs for entrepreneurship training and development.<sep>This paper builds on prior research and argues that religion, as an informal cultural institution, may impose constraints on corporations. The framework of Shariah-compliant firms presents a unique opportunity to investigate this assertion and checks whether firms with Islamic label pay out more or less dividend. Since Islamic Law narrows the investment opportunity sets for Shariah-compliant firms, one would expect Shariah-compliant firms to pay out more dividends to shareholders (investment constraint hypothesis). On the other hand, the prohibition of interest-bearing financing, make of retained earnings an appealing alternative to finance projects, hence resulting in lower dividend payouts (financing constraint hypothesis). Tests on a sample of 13,249 firm-year observations from 17 Islamic countries support the investment constraint hypothesis: Shariah-compliant firms pay out more dividends than non-Shariah compliant ones. Our results are robust to various specifications and after controlling for different variables and addressing potential endogeneity concerns.<sep>In this study, we examine the impact of board reforms on the choice between bank and public debt. Using a large sample of firm-year observations from 29 countries and a difference-in-difference setting, we find that major board reforms lead to a decrease in bank debt ratio, particularly in companies where bank debt is used for monitoring purposes, suggesting that bank debt and board reforms are substitutes for monitoring managers' actions. We also find that board reforms' adoption is associated with a facilitated access to alternative financing sources with better terms than bank debt. In an additional analysis, we show that the decrease in bank debt ratio is stronger for firms with higher information opacity and those in countries with strong institutional environment. More importantly, we provide evidence that the decrease in bank debt post-reform increases firm value, indicating that the substitution between bank monitoring and board monitoring is a value-enhancing decision. Taken collectively, we conclude that the need for bank monitoring is endogenously determined by the strength of alternative governance mechanisms (i.e. board governance).<sep>Accurately modelling and forecasting electricity consumption remains a challenging task due to the large number of the statistical properties that characterize this time series such as seasonality, trend, sudden changes, slow decay of autocrrelation function, among many others. This study contributes to this literature by using and comparing four advanced time series econometrics models, and four machine learning and deep learning models1 to analyze and forecast electricity consumption during COVID-19 pre-lockdown, lockdown, releasing-lockdown, and post-lockdown phases. Monthly data on Qatar’s total electricity consumption has been used from January 2010 to December 2021. The empirical findings demonstrate that both econometric and machine learning models are able to capture most of the important statistical features characterizing electricity consumption. In particular, it is found that climate change based factors, e.g temperature, rainfall, mean sea-level pressure and wind speed, are key determinants of electricity consumption. In terms of forecasting, the results indicate that the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average and the three state autoregressive markov switching models with exogenous variables outperform all other models.

The effective force and effective mass matrix are important elements in the equations of motion of equilibrium continuity dynamics, where only the zeroth term of an exact series expansion of the phase space propagator is involved. We introduce a machine learning approach for fitting these elements in quantum phase space, leading to a much more efficient integration of the equations of motion. Proof-of-concept applications to realistic molecules demonstrate that machine learning phase space dynamics approaches are possible as well as competent in producing reasonably accurate results with a modest computation effort.<sep>The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving significant changes in the field of atomic modeling, simulation, and design. AI-based potential energy models have been successfully used to perform large-scale and long-time simulations with the accuracy of ab initio electronic structure methods. However, the model generation process still hinders applications at scale. We envision that the next stage would be a model-centric ecosystem, in which a large atomic model (LAM), pre-trained with as many atomic datasets as possible and can be efficiently fine-tuned and distilled to downstream tasks, would serve the new infrastructure of the field of molecular modeling. We propose DPA-2, a novel architecture for a LAM, and develop a comprehensive pipeline for model fine-tuning, distillation, and application, associated with automatic workflows. We show that DPA-2 can accurately represent a diverse range of chemical systems and materials, enabling high-quality simulations and predictions with significantly reduced efforts compared to traditional methods.

Understanding the biology of these cross-links is important for the development of antibiotic therapies to target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Our work provides evidence that LdtC can function as the sole enzyme for 3-3 cross-link formation in M. smegmatis and suggests that LdtC may be part of a carbapenem-resistant l , d -transpeptidase pathway.<sep>Herein, we report the design and synthesis of inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase I (MurX), the first membrane-associated step of peptidoglycan synthesis, leveraging the privileged structure of the sansanmycin family of uridylpeptide natural products. A number of analogues bearing hydrophobic amide modifications to the pseudo-peptidic end of the natural product scaffold were generated that exhibited nanomolar inhibitory activity against Mtb MurX and potent activity against Mtb in vitro. We show that a lead analogue bearing an appended neopentylamide moiety possesses rapid antimycobacterial effects with a profile similar to the frontline tuberculosis drug isoniazid. This molecule was also capable of inhibiting Mtb growth in macrophages where mycobacteria reside in vivo and reduced mycobacterial burden in an in vivo zebrafish model of tuberculosis.<sep>The antiproliferative effects of four series of VIVO- and VVO-based compounds containing 8-hydroxyquinoline ligands on the bacterium Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (M. smeg) were investigated. The effects on M. smeg were compared to the antiproliferative effects on the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), the causative agent for Chagas disease. In this study, we investigate the speciation of these compounds under physiological conditions as well as the antiproliferative effects on the bacterium M. smeg. We find that the complexes are more stable the less H2O is present, and that the stability increases in lipid-like environments. Only one heteroleptic complex and two homoleptic complexes were found to show similar antiproliferative effects on M. smeg as reported for T. cruzi so the responses generally observed by M.smeg. is less than observed by the pathogen. In summary, we find that M. smeg is more sensitive to the detailed structure of the V-complex but overall these complexes are less effective against M. smeg compared to T. cruzi.<sep>A major problem with patient treatments using anticancer compounds is accompanying bacterial infections, which makes more information on how such compounds impact bacterial growth desirable. In the following study, we investigated the growth effects of an anticancerous non-toxic Schiff base oxidovanadium(V) complex (N-(salicylideneaminato)-N′-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine) coordinated to the 3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholato ligand on a representative bacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smeg). We prepared the Schiff base V-complexes as reported previously and selected a few complexes to develop a V-complex series. Biological studies of M. smeg growth inhibition were complemented by spectroscopic studies using UV-Vis spectrophotometry and NMR spectroscopy to determine which complexes were intact under biologically relevant conditions. We specifically chose to examine (1) the growth effects of Schiff base oxidovanadium complexes coordinated to a catechol, (2) the growth effects of respective free catecholates on M. smeg, and (3) to identify complexes where the metal coordination complex was more potent than the ligand alone under biological conditions. Results from these studies showed that the observed effects of Schiff base V-catecholate complex are a combination of catechol properties including toxicity, hydrophobicity, and sterics.<sep>Menaquinone is one of the major lipoquinones involved in the respiratory chains of bacteria, which includes ubiquinone. Menaquinone is an essential component in the electron transfer process and ATP synthesis especially in some Gram-positive bacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. Tb). However, mammals utilize ubiquinone in the analogous electron transfer processes, and do not synthesize menaquinone. In the biosynthesis of menaquinone, MenA is an important enzyme, which is involved in the conversion of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-napthoate to demethylmenaquinone via prenyl transferase activity. Therefore MenA is chosen as a drug target in determining the inhibitor. While designing and screening MenA inhibitors we observed that benzophenone derivatives showed high coordination with enzymes in transition state and interrupted the growth of M. Tb moderately. In addition, diphenyl ether derivatives also showed moderate MIC and IC50 results. Therefore, to improve the biological activity we synthesized a polymeric compound having both benzophenone and diphenyl ether groups. In addition, a hydrophilic functional group was introduced into the polymeric compound to enhance the biological activity. The synthesized polymeric inhibitor showed improved MIC and IC50 values to inhibit the M. tb infection.<sep>In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, proline dehydrogenase (PruB) and ∆1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase (PruA) are monofunctional enzymes that catalyze proline oxidation to glutamate via the intermediates P5C and L-glutamate-γ-semialdehyde. Both enzymes are essential for the replication of pathogenic M. tuberculosis. Highly active enzymes were expressed and purified using a Mycobacterium smegmatis expression system. The purified enzymes were characterized using natural substrates and chemically synthesized analogs. The structural requirements of the quinone electron acceptor were examined. PruB displayed activity with all tested lipoquinone analogs (naphthoquinone or benzoquinone). In PruB assays utilizing analogs of the native naphthoquinone [MK-9 (II-H2)] specificity constants Kcat/Km were an order of magnitude greater for the menaquinone analogs than the benzoquinone analogs. In addition, mycobacterial PruA was enzymatically characterized for the first time using exogenous chemically synthesized P5C. A Km value of 120 ± 0.015 µM was determined for P5C, while the Km value for NAD+ was shown to be 33 ± 4.3 µM. Furthermore, proline competitively inhibited PruA activity and coupled enzyme assays, suggesting that the recombinant purified monofunctional PruB and PruA enzymes of M. tuberculosis channel substrate likely increase metabolic flux and protect the bacterium from methylglyoxal toxicity.<sep>Pyrazinamide, a first-line antibiotic used against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has been shown to act in a pH-dependent manner in vitro. Why pyrazinamide, an antitubercle prodrug discovered more than 65 years ago, exhibits this pH-dependent activity was unclear. Upon entering mycobacterial cells, pyrazinamide is deamidated to pyrazinoate by an enzymatic process and exists in an acid–base equilibrium with pyrazinoic acid. Thus, the effects of total pyrazinoic acid (pyrazinoic acid + pyrazinoate) on M. tuberculosis growth, pH homeostasis, and proton motive force over a range of pH values found in host tissues were investigated. Although M. tuberculosis was able to maintain pH homeostasis over an external pH range of 7.0 to 5.5, total pyrazinoic acid induced growth inhibition increased as culture medium pH was decreased from 7.3 to 6.4. Consistent with growth inhibition, total pyrazinoic acid increased both acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm and dissipation of membrane potential as the environmental pH decreased when added to the bacterial suspensions. The results suggest pyrazinoic acid is the active form of the drug, which acts as an uncoupler of proton motive force, likely a protonophore, providing a mechanistic explanation for the pH dependence of the drug activity.<sep>Menaquinones are lipoquinones that consist of a headgroup (naphthoquinone, menadione) and an isoprenyl sidechain. They function as electron transporters in prokaryotes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For these studies, we used Langmuir monolayers and microemulsions to investigate how the menaquinone headgroup (menadione) and the menahydroquinone headgroup (menadiol) interact with model membrane interfaces to determine if differences are observed in the location of these headgroups in a membrane. It has been suggested that the differences in the locations are mainly caused by the isoprenyl sidechain rather than the headgroup quinone-to-quinol reduction during electron transport. This study presents evidence that suggests the influence of the headgroup drives the movement of the oxidized quinone and the reduced hydroquinone to different locations within the interface. Utilizing the model membranes of microemulsions and Langmuir monolayers, it is determined whether or not there is a difference in the location of menadione and menadiol within the interface. Based on our findings, we conclude that the menadione and menadiol may reside in different locations within model membranes. It follows that if menaquinone moves within the cell membrane upon menaquinol formation, it is due at least in part, to the differences in the properties of headgroup interactions with the membrane in addition to the isoprenyl sidechain.<sep>The electron transport chain (ETC) in the cell membrane consists of a series of redox complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to acceptors and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H+) across a membrane. This process generates proton motive force which is used to produce ATP and a myriad of other functions and is essential for the long-term survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative organism of tuberculosis (TB), under the hypoxic conditions present within infected granulomas. Menaquinone (MK), an important carrier molecule within the mycobacterial ETC, is synthesized de novo by a cluster of enzymes known as the classic/canonical MK biosynthetic pathway. MenA (1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate prenyltransferase), the antepenultimate enzyme in this pathway, is a verified target for TB therapy. In this study, we explored structure-activity relationships of a previously discovered MenA inhibitor scaffold, seeking to improve potency and drug disposition properties. Focusing our campaign upon three molecular regions, we identified two novel inhibitors with potent activity against MenA and Mtb (IC50 = 13-22 μM, GIC50 = 8-10 μM). These analogs also displayed substantially improved pharmacokinetic parameters and potent synergy with other ETC-targeting agents, achieving nearly complete sterilization of Mtb in combination therapy within two weeks in vivo. These new inhibitors of MK biosynthesis present a promising new strategy to curb the continued spread of TB.<sep>Menaquinones (MK) are hydrophobic molecules that consist of a naphthoquinone headgroup and a repeating isoprenyl side chain and are cofactors used in bacterial electron transport systems to generate cellular energy. We have previously demonstrated that the folded conformation of truncated MK homologues, MK-1 and MK-2, in both solution and reverse micelle microemulsions depended on environment. There is little information on how MKs associate with phospholipids in a model membrane system and how MKs affect phospholipid organization. In this manuscript, we used a combination of Langmuir monolayer studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe these questions on truncated MK homologues, MK-1 through MK-4 within a model membrane. We observed that truncated MKs reside farther away from the interfacial water than ubiquinones are are located closer to the phospholipid tails. We also observed that phospholipid packing does not change at physiological pressure in the presence of truncated MKs, though a difference in phospholipid packing has been observed in the presence of ubiquinones. We found through MD simulations that for truncated MKs, the folded conformation varied, but MKs location and association with the bilayer remained unchanged at physiological conditions regardless of side chain length. Combined, this manuscript provides fundamental information, both experimental and computational, on the location, association, and conformation of truncated MK homologues in model membrane environments relevant to bacterial energy production.<sep>Pyrazinoic acid is the active form of pyrazinamide, a first-line antibiotic used to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. However, the mechanism of action of pyrazinoic acid remains a subject of debate, and alternatives to pyrazinamide in cases of resistance are not available. The work presented here demonstrates that pyrazinoic acid and known protonophores including salicylic acid, benzoic acid, and carbonyl cyanide m -chlorophenyl hydrazone all exhibit pH-dependent inhibition of mycobacterial growth activity over a physiologically relevant range of pH values. Other anti-tubercular drugs, including rifampin, isoniazid, bedaquiline, and p -aminosalicylic acid, do not exhibit similar pH-dependent growth-inhibitory activities. The growth inhibition curves of pyrazinoic, salicylic, benzoic, and picolinic acids, as well as carbonyl cyanide m -chlorophenyl hydrazone, all fit a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) derived from acid–base equilibria with R 2 values &amp;gt; 0.95. The QSAR model indicates that growth inhibition relies solely on the concentration of the protonated forms of these weak acids (rather than the deprotonated forms). Moreover, pyrazinoic acid, salicylic acid, and carbonyl cyanide m -chlorophenyl hydrazone all caused acidification of the mycobacterial cytoplasm at concentrations that inhibit bacterial growth. Thus, it is concluded that pyrazinoic acid acts as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and that disruption of proton motive force is the primary mechanism of action of pyrazinoic acid rather than the inhibition of a classic enzyme activity.<sep>Menaquinone (MK) is an essential component of the electron transport chain (ETC) in the gram-variable Mycobacterium tuberculosis and many Gram-positive pathogens. Three genes in the M. tuberculosis genome were annotated as methyltransferases involved in lipoquinone synthesis in mycobacteria. Heterologous expression of Rv0558 complemented an ubiE (the quinone C-methyltransferase involved in ubiquinone and menaquinone synthesis) deletion in Escherichia coli, and expression in a wild-type E. coli strain increased quinone C-methyltransferase specific activity by threefold. Rv0558 encodes a canonical C-methyltransferase or, more specifically, a S-adenosylmethionine/demethylmenaquinol methyltransferase. Partially purified recombinant protein catalyzed the formation of MK from demethylmenaquinone (DMK), although the activity of the recombinant protein was low and appeared to require a cofactor or intact membrane structure for activity. Membrane preparations from irradiated M. tuberculosis also showed poor activity; however, membrane preparations from wild-type Mycobacterium smegmatis showed robust, substrate-dependent activity. The apparent Km values for demethylmenaquinone and SAM were 14 ± 5.0 and 17 ± 7.0 μM, respectively. Interestingly, addition of dithiothreitol, dithionite, NADH, or other substrates of primary dehydrogenases to reaction mixtures containing membrane preparations stimulated the activity. Thus, these observations strongly suggest that demethylmenaquinol is the actual substrate of MenG. Ro 48-8071, previously reported to inhibit mycobacterial MK synthesis and growth, inhibited Rv0558 activity with an IC50 value of 5.1 ± 0.5 μM, and DG70 (GSK1733953A), first described as a respiration inhibitor in M. tuberculosis, inhibits MenG activity with an IC50 value of 2.6 ± 0.6 μM.<sep>The menaquinone biosynthetic pathway presents a promising drug target against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and potentially other Gram-positive pathogens. In the present study, the essentiality, steady state kinetics of MenA from M. tuberculosis and the mechanism of MenA inhibition by Ro 48-8071 were characterized. MenA [isoprenyl diphosphate:1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA) isoprenyltransferase] catalyzes a critical reaction in menaquinone biosynthesis that involves the conversion of cytosolic DHNA, to membrane bound demethylmenaquinone by transferring a hydrophobic 45-carbon isoprenoid chain (in the case of mycobacteria) to the ring nucleus of DHNA. Rv0534c previously identified as the gene encoding MenA in M. tuberculosis complemented a menA deletion in E. coli and an E. coli host expressing Rv0534c exhibited an eight-fold increase in MenA specific activity over the control strain harboring empty vector under similar assay conditions. Expression of Rv0534c is essential for mycobacterial survival and the native enzyme from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was characterized using membrane preparations as it was not possible to solubilize and purify the recombinant enzyme. The enzyme is absolutely dependent on the presence of a divalent cation for optimal activity with Mg+2 being the most effective and is active over a wide pH range, with pH 8.5 being optimal. The apparent Km values for DHNA and farnesyl diphosphate were found to be 8.2 and 4.3 μM, respectively. Ro 48-8071, a compound previously reported to inhibit mycobacterial MenA activity, is non-competitive with regard to DHNA and competitive with regard to the isoprenyldiphosphate substrate.<sep>Menaquinones (MKs) are essential for electron transport in prokaryotes, and importantly, partially saturated MKs represent a novel virulence factor. However, little is known regarding how the degree of saturation in the isoprenyl side chain influences conformation or quinone redox potential. MenJ is an enzyme that selectively reduces the second isoprene unit on MK-9 and is contextually essential for the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in J774A.1 macrophage-like cells, suggesting that MenJ may be a conditional drug target for pathogenic mycobacteria. Therefore, fundamental information about the properties of this system is important, and we synthesized the simplest MKs, unsaturated MK-1 and the saturated analogue, MK-1(H2). Using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we established that MK-1 and MK-1(H2) adopted similar folded-extended conformations (i.e., the isoprenyl side chain folds upward) in each solvent examined but the folded-extended conformations differed slightly between organic solvents. Saturation of the isoprenyl side chain slightly altered the MK-1 analogue conformation in each solvent. We used molecular mechanics to illustrate the MK-1 analogue conformations. The measured quinone redox potentials of MK-1 and MK-1(H2) differed between organic solvents (presumably due to differences in dielectric constants), and remarkably, an ∼20 mV semiquinone redox potential difference was observed between MK-1 and MK-1(H2) in pyridine, acetonitrile, and dimethyl sulfoxide, demonstrating that the degree of saturation in the isoprenyl side chain of MK-1 influences the quinone redox potential. Finally, MK-1 and MK-1(H2) interacted with Langmuir phospholipid monolayers and Aerosol-OT reverse micelle (RM) model membrane interfaces, where MK-1 adopted a slightly different folded conformation within the RM model membrane interface.<sep>Peptidoglycan (PG) is a cross-linked, meshlike scaffold endowed with the strength to withstand the internal pressure of bacteria. Bacteria are known to heavily remodel their peptidoglycan stem peptides, yet little is known about the physiological impact of these chemical variations on peptidoglycan cross-linking. Furthermore, there are limited tools to study these structural variations, which can also have important implications on cell wall integrity and host immunity. Cross-linking of peptide chains within PG is an essential process, and its disruption thereof underpins the potency of several classes of antibiotics. Two primary cross-linking modes have been identified that are carried out by D,D-transpeptidases and L,D-transpeptidases (Ldts). The nascent PG from each enzymatic class is structurally unique, which results in different cross-linking configurations. Recent advances in PG cellular probes have been powerful in advancing the understanding of D,D-transpeptidation by Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs). In contrast, no cellular probes have been previously described to directly interrogate Ldt function in live cells. Herein, we describe a new class of Ldt-specific probes composed of structural analogs of nascent PG, which are metabolically incorporated into the PG scaffold by Ldts. With a panel of tetrapeptide PG stem mimics, we demonstrated that subtle modifications such as amidation of iso-Glu can control PG cross-linking. Ldt probes were applied to quantify and track the localization of Ldt activity in Enterococcus faecium, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These results confirm that our Ldt probes are specific and suggest that the primary sequence of the stem peptide can control Ldt cross-linking levels. We anticipate that unraveling the interplay between Ldts and other cross-linking modalities may reveal the organization of the PG structure in relation to the spatial localization of cross-linking machineries.<sep>Inhibitory effects of two monosubstituted decavanadates by PtIV in monoplatino(IV)nonavanadate(V) ([H2PtIVV9O28]5-, V9Pt), and by MoIV in monomolybdo(VI)nonavanadate(V) ([MoVIV9O28]5-,V9Mo) were investigated against the growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis with the EC50 values of 0.0048 mM and 0.015 mM, respectively. These compare to the reported inhibitory value for decavanadate ([V10O28]6-/[HV10O28]5-, V10) on Mycobacterium smegmatis (EC50 = 0.0037 mM). Time-dependent 51V NMR spectroscopic studies were carried out for all three polyanions in aqueous solution, biological medium (7H9), heated and non-heated supernatant to evaluate their stability in their respective media, monitor their hydrolysis to form various oxovanadates over time and calculate the EC50 values. These studies allow us to calculate adjusted and maximum EC50 for the polyoxovanadate (POV) present in solution at the beginning of the study when there is most intact anion in the media and thus the EC50 values represent the initial effects of the POVs. The results have shown that V10 is 1.3 times more potent than V9Pt and 4 times more potent than V9Mo, indicating that the inhibitory effects of monosubstituted polyanions are related to the V10 structure. We attributed the minor differences in the growth inhibitory effects to the differences in charges (5- vs 6-) of V9Pt and V9Mo compared to V10 and/or the differences in the chemical composition. We concluded that the potency of the growth inhibition by V10 is mainly due to the chemical properties of the vanadium and the decametalate's unique structure even though the presence of the Mycobacterium smegmatis facilitate hydrolysis of the anions. SYNOPSIS: Two decavanadate derivatives, monoplatino(IV)nonavanadate(V) ([H2PtIVV9O28]5-), monomolybdo(VI)nonavanadate(V) ([MoVIV9O28]5-) and decavanadate are more potent growth inhibitors of Mycobacterium smegmatis than monomeric vanadate. The spectroscopic characterization carried out in the growth medium led to the<sep>Lipoquinones, such as ubiquinones (UQ) and menaquinones (MK), function as essential lipid components of the electron transport system (ETS) by shuttling electrons and protons to facilitate the production of ATP in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Lipoquinone function in membrane systems has been widely studied, but the exact location and conformation within membranes remains controversial. Lipoquinones, such as Coenzyme Q (UQ-10), are generally depicted simply as \"Q\" in life science diagrams or in extended conformations in primary literature even though specific conformations are important for function in the ETS. In this study, our goal was to determine the location, orientation, and conformation of UQ-2, a truncated analog of UQ-10, in model membrane systems and to compare our results to previously studied MK-2. Herein, we first carried out a six-step synthesis to yield UQ-2 and then demonstrated that UQ-2 adopts a folded conformation in organic solvents using 1H-1H 2D NOESY and ROESY NMR spectroscopic studies. Similarly, using 1H-1H 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopic studies, UQ-2 was found to adopt a folded, U-shaped conformation within the interface of an AOT reverse micelle model membrane system. UQ-2 was located slightly closer to the surfactant-water interface compared to the more hydrophobic MK-2. In addition, Langmuir monolayer studies determined UQ-2 resided within the monolayer water-phospholipid interface causing expansion, whereas MK-2 was more likely to be compressed out and reside within the phospholipid tails. All together these results support the model that lipoquinones fold regardless of the headgroup structure but that the polarity of the headgroup influences lipoquinone location within the membrane interface. These results have implications regarding the redox activity near the interface as quinone vs. quinol forms may facilitate locomotion of lipoquinones within the membrane. The location, orientation,<sep>MenJ, a flavoprotein oxidoreductase, is responsible for the saturation of the β-isoprene unit of mycobacterial menaquinone, resulting in the conversion of menaquinone with nine isoprene units (MK-9) to menaquinone with nine isoprene units where the double bond in the second unit is reduced [MK-9(II-H2)]. The hydrogenation of MK-9 increases the efficiency of the mycobacterial electron transport system, whereas the deletion of MenJ results in decreased survival of the bacteria inside J774A.1 macrophage-like cells but is not required for growth in culture. Thus, it was suggested that MenJ may represent a contextual drug target in M. tuberculosis, that is, a drug target that is valid only in the context of an infected macrophage. However, it was unclear if the conversion of MK-9 to MK-9(II-H2) or the MenJ protein itself was responsible for bacterial survival. In order to resolve this issue, a plasmid expressing folded, full-length, inactive MenJ was engineered. Primary sequence analysis data revealed that MenJ shares conserved FAD binding, NADH binding, and catalytic and C-terminal motifs with archaeal geranylgeranyl reductases. A MenJ mutant deficient in any one of these motifs is devoid of reductase activity. Therefore, point mutations of highly conserved amino acids in the conserved motifs were generated and the recombinant proteins were monitored for conformational changes by circular dichroism and oxidoreductase activity. The mutational analysis indicates that amino acids tryptophan 215 (W215) and cysteine 46 (C46) of M. tuberculosis MenJ, conserved in known archaeal geranylgeranyl reductases and putative menaquinone saturases, are essential to the hydrogenation of MK-9. The mutation of either C46 to serine (C46S) or W215 to leucine (W215L) in MenJ completely abolishes the catalytic activity in vitro, and menJ knockout strains of M. tuberculosis expressing either the</abstract>", "query_id": "https://jobs.sciencecareers.org/job/613652", "passage_id1": "https://openalex.org/A5063919709", "passage_id2": "https://openalex.org/A5070542679", "response": "Comparison: Candidate B demonstrates a strong alignment with the job description, particularly in the areas of in vitro enzyme assays, drug discovery, and experience with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is highly relevant to the pharmaceutical industry focus of the role.
